B0007RDM5Q,1.0,"The graphics seem dated and rushed.  The gameplay was laborious and after 30 minutes I simply could not play anymore as it seemed I was wasting my time.  I was playing with two player option, but the second player wound up always having to be a robot.  The second stage was having each character escape from the hospital and fight off robots and solve puzzles to open doors; I don't rememeber any of that in the movie.  I would not recommend.",-

I remember seeing ROME total war 1 trailer on x-play in the year 2005 and buying it at fifty dollars and only being able to run it on low settings using integrated graphics. Here is the list of total war games I played, ROME 1, Medieval 2, Empire, I skipped shogun 2 even though I bought it on steam.
Computer Specs:

i5 3570k
7850 1gb
8 gb ddr3
1tb hdd
500w

Graphics 4/5
The settings surprised me as they were set on extreme preset. Here I am with a 7850 im about to sell in another computer on ebay, with a gtx 760 2gb coming in tomorrow which won't improve anything on this game. as the 7850 1gb is good enough to run at 60 fps on extreme with small size armies, I know, I know thats not how you play a total war game. But it makes battles take up less time. Not that it matters in this game any more. average battle time is 5 minutes the troops move faster compared to medieval 2. The one thing I hate the most out of anything is the arrows, javlins, slingers animation. The grey lines that run across the screen and roman roman velites can ignite their javs. Aside from that I had problems with LOW RES textures, doing a quick search on the Internet I found a simple fix, enabling unlimited video memory on graphics options. the level of detail doubled. The in game benchmark shows a deer where it was blurry before It becomes more detailed. The facial animations is stellar. I mean you can actually see the nose on your troops and wrinkles on foreheads and its just detailed. Overall 4/5 on graphics

Gameplay 3/5
Graphics aren't everything especially in total war games, ROME 1 was fun to play because thats how it was developed, simple and fun. Rome 2 is an overhaul on just about everything. Its fun learning all the new features and theres an in game wiki to help you out if you need it. The wiki or in-game manual comes in handy even for familiar total war players. And will be twice as useful for new comers. On the campaign map at times I would get sleepy as I didn't know what the f all these new icons and features were. But that's me I noted that this is similar to CIV series. I never played those games and now you see why.

BUGS So far
LOW RES textures = fixed by enabling unlimited video memory.
Stuck on AI turn. = fixed by loading previous save game.

Worth every penny not right now, I know it seems hard but if you can wait just a month then catch it on a steam sale or it may be included in AMD's never settle bundles. I would wait, but thats easy for me to say I already have the game. Do what you want.

game sucks nuff said",ROME II: BETA cause thats the quality they released
B0016BVY7U,1.0,Do not buy this game! The installation code included inside the box doesn't work so this game is useless. I can't believe that EA are so inept that they won't even send a working code so I can install their evil securom but apparently they are. I can't believe EA calls pirates thieves when they sell games like this that are impossible to install because the installation code won't work.

B0178FWY62,1.0,Its loud AF. Like one of the fans is hitting something its so loud. If i push down on my ps4 on the stand it will not make the hitting sound and be a more tolerable sounding fan but its still loud. It charges the ps4 Controllers as advertised and ive only used one of the ports and it charged my vape pen so thats cool i guess. Still going to be a 1 star because im pretty sure this loud ass fan i can hear over my surround sound is going to go out by the end of the week. Also it does NOT cool my ps4.

B00AAS888S,1.0,"Terrible mouse, not worth the money at all. I've had a lot of problems with PC Mice, and decided to give this one a shot due to a recommendation from a friend, but mouse is incredibly cheap - the buttons are too sensitive to the point where just holding the mouse causes you to accidentally click ever 5 seconds. I'm very disappointed, I expected for the amount of money I paid to actually have a decent quality mouse but I guess I'll have to keep searching. You can get a mouse that is the same, or better quality for 10 buck; it feels just as cheap and you can buy more of them for the same price. Additionally, when you're moving the cursor, it will randomly shoot across as though it isn't sure where you're moving the cursor at all. It's incredibly cheap, and very overpriced for how bad of a mouse it is. Don't waste your time with this.",Don't waste your money
B00DBF829C,1.0,"I waited till I could buy FFXV for $20, because I knew I would dislike it. And I did! The Franchise has gone downhill since FFX, the last great FF game. FFXV is plagued by an incomprehensible story line, characters you do not give a crap about, mindless button mashing and another boring combat system, and camera problems. It is too bad developers these days, think all RPGs should be fast, over the top, real time action oriented. LEGEND OF HEROES / TRAIL OF THE COLD STEEL VOL 1 & 2, has proved that wrong. There still is a place for turn-based RPGs, with characters you care about, and a solid story line. (Vol. 3 is on the way)
If this over the top, action oriented path, is the route FFVII REMAKE is going to follow, then count me out! I have played the FF Series since it's inception, and FFVII has always held a special place in my heart, until LEGEND OF HEROES came along.
I believe there still is a solid market place for turn-based RPGs, with characters you care about, and an engrossing story line. Please give the LEGEND OF HEROES a try. It is what an RPG is supposed to deliver.
The old developers at SQUARE-ENIX are gone. And so is the anticipation of a forth-coming FF game.

B005THAX60,1.0,"I LOVE Aliens - movies and game of the past.

Did the developers of this game ever play AvsP2????

Perhaps this was meant to be a prequel to AvsP1  both in graphics and AI?

If I was a game developer and released this I would be embarrassed.  Sure I couldn't code a game of pong but if you give me the $$$ from the pre-orders for this game and I'll take a dump in a tin can and mail it out at least I won't ruin the Aliens franchise as much as this did.

B00S9SH7V0,1.0,"*Do not order from Better Choice Online.
I received a used mouse but ordered a brand new one. Food crumbs in the buttons and everything. The mouse is great, Zowie makes the best gaming mice in MY opinion, so I know it's not Zowie's fault.",*Be careful who you buy from
B0001UEHP8,1.0,"Okay, whether you have high expectations or none at all, this game just doesn't work. For one, the whole ""freedom of choice"" thing is a huge lie. If you want to be ""good"", you can rescue the same people over and over; for ""evil"", you kill them repeatedly. That's it. Second, you CANNOT choose where you want to go and what you want to do there. This game is mission-based, just like every other bland game this year. Oh, sure, you can ""choose"" which mission you want, but if you choose any but the ""right"" one, you'll find yourself getting killed in an instant. So no matter what you do, you have to follow a linear path.

The gameplay is a mess as well. The combat system doesn't work half the time (you'll often accidentally target people instead of enemies), and even when it does work, you'll still get killed because your skills aren't powerful enough. How do you get them more powerful? By going to the forest and killing bees until you level up. Hmmm, where have I heard this before? In every single other RPG to hit the market, perhaps? Unlike better games, where you always find yourself at the right level to move forward if you take on all the available enemies, Fable forces you to go back and forth between areas to get the enemies to respawn, watching a long loading screen each and every time you exit and enter an area. What fun.

Even the non-combat interface is completely dilapidated. Menus were a monster to navigate, and it took me a good ten minutes just to get my equipment on. And don't get me started on my attempt to use the controller customization feature.

Finally, there are the things that aren't ""broken"" exactly, but are still annoying. Like the people, for example. Even when you are just walking through an area, perhaps on your way back to kill more bees, NPCs are constantly chattering away in irritating accents. You can't get a moment's peace. Also, you can call me a prude if you wish, but I can't believe that ""burp"" and ""fart"" have their own buttons. This game is rated M for mature, but perhaps it should be rated I for immature.

Overall, Fable is an annoying, clunky, and frustrating game. Far from the promised revoloution, it delivers a package that doesn't even meet mediocre standards.",I can't believe it!
B00168PFFK,1.0,"I don't know why this product has so many positive reviews, plain and simply this product is junk.  Save your $2.00.

You get three screen protectors, good luck trying to get one of them applied correctly.  The sticky side is so strong you have to pull very hard to get it off the plastic protector.  I did this on my first attempt and hit my shirt, it picked up lint and immediately ruined it.  Also, the cloth provided sheds tons of lint, so don't use it to clean your screen before application.

I managed to get my second protector on as instructed and lint free.  However, it traps air bubbles like crazy.  It says to use the tool to get the air bubbles out, but no tool is provided.  I used the the cardboard packaging.  After about a 1/2 hour I got 1/2 the air bubbles out, however, there were bubble marks where some of the bubbles used to be.  I tried to remove the screen but it holds fast and it ripped when I finally removed it.

I tried a third time being extra careful and patient with my last screen cover, but still no matter how I tried applying the protector, it kept trapping bubbles and removing the bubbles still left bubble marks.  Lastly, the screen is about 1-2 mm too short for the PSP 3000 screen.",This is Junk
B00178630A,1.0,"Like many other people here, had waited an exorbitant amount of time for Blizzard to deliver this game. I thought they were making the game better (and the graphics and such appear stellar) but it now looks like they were just trying to force the online only platform during all the extra time and delays (I had it on order since 2010). I had hoped they would have learned from the Starcraft 2 debacle that people don't like the always on line games.  I travel a lot and don't always have an internet connection to play (like on long flights or in a building with no wireless reception and no wired connection)... they should have at least provided an option like Oblivion Skyrim (you need to be online to start the game... but then can be offline and your game needs to be saved locally until you play again online and the latest games can be synced with the Cloud).

From what I played it has a similar play style of smasg bros- attack- damage increase- knock opponents off the screen.
But it is sluggish, and just from seeing how Poe and Tigress play there is easily going to be characters that are good and some that are unbalanced.
Items seemed OK but it is a strange game, if it was more fast paced and actually had good attacks than it would be great, sadley I would have bought it only because it was pretty dam close to smash bros, but it feels unfinished.

B001383L2W,1.0,"So i bought this game yesterday 6-11.  Couldnt wait to get off work so i could go play.  put the game in and actually sit through the tutorials.  Lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked.... remember i am only in the tutorial.  After i finished tutorial i went to the saga.  Now being someone that owned all budokai's i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline.  To say the least i was wrong.  I finished the story that night.  I mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga?  I came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi 3, seeing as that only makes sense.  What really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened.  I think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga.  I mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway, so why not give us something we want.  When i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay.  Not half of a game with better graphics.  Btw they include the first disk of season one ......  Season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it.  Why give out something we already own.  Even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you don't own it.  I mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set.  Just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise.  I strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth.  This game to me is WAS worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price.  Trust me you are better off getting something else.

Cons
1.  Game is short only through the cell saga.
2.  Game has cutscenes every 5 seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you.
3.  Maps are incredibly small.  you can successfully hit someone about 2-3 times before you hit a wall.
4.  Gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
5.  YOU HAVE UNLIMITED SPECIALS with little to no delay before refire. tisk tisk
6.  Limited characters maybe 13 or so.
7.  Transformations make you weaker......why why would they do that.
8.  Game is 100% completed in one night.
9.  Absolutely no replay value at all.  I sold the game first chance i got.
10. When you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo bady.

B00EPOTBUC,1.0,"Worst game I ever played. The development team does not listen to the community and the majority of negative feedback on the forums is rewarded by deletion and infraction points. The game is entirely zerg oriented and there have been no updates for team-play content in the past 2 years. The classes are highly unbalanced and balance patches are only made every 3+ months. The game lacks common sense or logic, for example:

1- Guardians have shields, but can block nothing with the shield. The shield is aesthetic.
2- Guardians can set enemies on fire better underwater than they can on land
3- Flying insect enemies can chase you and swim underwater...
4- Thieves can stealth out of a fight any time they want as many times as they want whenever they want and heal to full then come back and fight you some more

Events and updates to the game have been made through the ""Living Story"". The living story is a group of events that require no coordination or effort. You simply stand still and tediously attack enemies in sequence until they die along with 100 other people.

In-order to coax players into doing tedious content that they do not want to do; developers have made newer armors and items require that players grind through numerous things in the game. For instance; if you would like to get Ascended armor (whose only purpose is to grant you resistance for a repetative ladder-style dungeon where monsters deal a unique damage type that requires ascended armor to defend against) you must:

1- Level up a craft to 500
2- Tediously farm world events repetitively to collect thousands of dragonite ore
3- Tediously farm dungeons repetitively to collect emperyeal stars
4- Craft more tedious stuff (which is time locked, you can craft 1 per 24h so it will take a month to craft a full set)
5- Gather thousands of additional ingredients that had no purpose in the past (so you most likely had enough, but since they were so worthless you sold them)

Other genius updates include zone limits. The game is zerg oriented, yet the zones where events take place in have a hard cap on the number of players that can be in them. If your server schedules an event at a given time. You will not be able to enter the zone 60 minutes before the event starts. You will have to go there an hour earlier and stand there doing nothing.

Save your money. Do not buy this.
I absolutely would not recommend. I have never in my life regretted the purchase of a game in 20 years of gaming until I played this sad excuse of a game.

B0012LGHZI,1.0,"Prototype fails in the one thing I ask of a game: That it work. In brief, it doesn't much of the time, and when it does work, it's unimpressive.

It seems that Activision released this without adequate testing (if they tested it at all on systems other than the one owned by the guy who wrote it and maybe his mom's computer). The Web is replete with stories about how to fix the audio bug-- although there's no official patch on Activision's website, and the only thing at ""prototypegame.com"" is an advertisement for the sequel. The unofficial fixes require changing component settings and removing HID devices from the Device Manager-- drastic steps which I haven't seen recommended since the days of DOS and various incompatable video standards.

I've completed the first part, which seems to be a flash-forward scene. You click various buttons and do various things, none of which are really different from any other combination of clicks. Some seem to do damage in a wide range, others directly ahead of you. It doesn't matter. Just whale on the buttons.

You can run up buildings, which is cool a couple of times, until you realize there's no point to doing that (except perhaps to escape the chaos of Times Square). There's nothing on the rooftops except generic 1990s-looking textures. Fortunately you can fall any distance without injury.

The sluggishness of the game is confusing. It'll become unresponsive at odd times, and menus are nearly unmanagable, because of the really poorly designed screens and cursor. The menu screens are almost all black, and the mouse cursor is red-- which any freshman design student can tell you is a bad choice, being invisible to a large part of the population (yes, myself included) and hard to see for the rest. Furthermore, the mouse cursor jumps about by fits and starts-- if it was smoother, perhaps you could figure out where it was, but that's not really an option. You'll have to use the keyboard.

I suppose that you could have fun with this, smashing the same cars and beating up the same passers-by (textures are very limited and everything looks like everything else) while growing tentacles out of your body, but the appeal of that is limited for me. I got a little leery. Your first mission is to kill lots of soldiers. Why? OK, they killed some mutants and a girl that might have been infected, but about halfway through I paused and asked ""OK, why am I killing soldiers? Why am I not killing the icky mutants that are attacking innocent passers-by who all look the same?"" If it had been adequately described-- i.e. if there had been a writer attached to this project-- maybe I would have gone ahead and not felt like I was a super-powered terrorist. I know the basics of the story from the box description, but it's rather turgid and inconsistent. And it really should be assumed that the player starts from ground zero-- knowing nothing and learning things through play.

If you want a good third-person shooter, pick up the Mass Effect games. If you want a really good first-person shooter, invest in Deus Ex (three installments, all of which rock). If you want an extraordinary action story set in a unique environment, get Bioshock I and II (the sequel is nearly as good as the original and has better controls). If you want to see tentacles growing out of someone's body-- well, Japanese video has lots of that. If you like changing all the options on your system to suit one game that isn't a whole lot of fun, THEN try Prototype.",Might be a decent game if it actiually worked
B0002BIDEM,1.0,"My review could be an exact copy of what J. Tyson wrote on August 17:

 enjoyed playing this game up to the point it becomes impossible. How is this? It started in Dragast, the second stage of the game. The first puzzle I encountered was visually blocked out by green and white vertical lines that cover the entire screen. I thought maybe this was an isolated problem. I was able to get by this one puzzle referring to a walkthrough (kind of ruins it for me). The very next puzzle had a similar problem. I contacted Dreamcatcher and was given a patch to download and install that was supposed to fix the problem. No such luck. I have since been requested to provide some information from my pc and I am waiting for a response. This problem occured with two separate sets of disks. Only some of the puzzles are affected. I think the graphics are great and would love to be able to play this game minus the problems

_____________________

I've done EVERYTHING company has advised over their website, to no avail.  It would be REAL NICE to spend this kind of money for some enjoyment and get GRIEF instead.  Otherwise, as far as it goes (up until Dragast), it's a pretty nice game.  Nice if company did more for quality control.","I'd love to be able to play the whole game, but..."

B000AYIP8A,1.0,All of the games are to old to play on my PC. The game itself just makes my PC puke pixels all over my screen.,The game gives me a headache.
B000ZKA0KA,1.0,"Wow, how this thing was ever considered as a finished product is beyond me.  This has to be one of the worst PS3 titles I've encountered.  The biggest complaint I have involves the numerous bugs.

Installing the game itself and trying to play it for the first time gives you an error message.  It seems as if the 1.10 patch which you are forced to download corrupts your save game.  Since the game creates a save game when it first launches it is an impossible error to avoid.  After patching the game you will be informed that your save game is corrupt and that you must manually exit the game and delete the save game.  Seriously, the game forces you to delete its own save game just to play it for the first time.

While playing this game you will encounter the following:  You will get lock-ups leading to a frozen console.  You will see other players' characters missing weapons.  Most of the servers' ""channels"" will be full and open games will be difficult to find.  You will encounter serious lag during play.  Closer aiming will inexplicably cause your character to stand up.  The menus will respond slowly to your input.

There are other issues with this game beyond the glitches alone.  The graphics are poor for a PS3 title.  The textures are muddy and low resolution.  The game has plain lighting effects which fail to impress.  The blood effects appear to lifted directly from Mortal Kombat.  The control scheme is unnecessarily complicated with poor default mapping.  All buttons on the controller are used and some serve multiple functions based on the duration of a press.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really lead to superior control versus other, similar, games.  It's complex for the sake of complexity.  Features you expect in a modern game such as the ability to join one of your friend's games in progress, player muting, or even something as simple as your own name being highlighted in a long list of party members are absent.  Trophies, which are indicated on the box itself, are nowhere to be found.  They are promised in a future patch.

I'll write briefly about the headset as it's likely that's a main draw in the purchase of this bundle.  There are a couple of minor problems with the device.  The unit itself is quite heavy.  It is by far the bulkiest Bluetooth headset I've used.  You may feel your ear getting fatigued earlier than you'd hope for because of this.  The ear cushion is not adjustable in size so it may flop around in your ear as it dangles from the headset's hook.  The main attraction to be found is the giant mute button in the middle of the device.  Most headsets created  for use with cellular phones have an inconvenient mute function.  You will also receive on-screen notifications when changes are made to the unit such as volume adjustment, the mute toggle, and a battery charge indicator.

SOCOM: Confrontation isn't ready for prime time.  It has far too many show-stopping bugs and feels unpolished in most aspects.  I would stay far away from this game.  The headset is worth a purchase, but the game itself is not.",Avoid this game

B000056WU9,1.0,"Wow, where to begin.  I popped this game into my PS2 after several months of Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001.  I had forgotten how crappy the Triple Play series had declined to, but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back.  I had to force myself to finish a season last year with TP 2001.  I finished 1st with 116 wins (only because I quit trying after the all-star break to try and make it a little more competitive).  I had 95 homeruns and 196 RBI's with a player I created.  I could mention the errors in TP 2001 all day but won't because I am reviewing Triple Play for the PS2.  The graphics are a given, as is true with every PS2 game, so there's no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics.  The gameplay is virtually UNCHANGED from the PS1 series!!!  I can't believe with today's technology, they couldn't produce a better product.  I haven't played the game very much because of terrible boredom, so some of my facts may be inaccurate, but I doubt it.  The baserunning still feels like you're playing T-ball in kindergarten.  If you hit a line drive to the wall in right-center, most of the time your runner only gets a single because he's too slow to make it to second.  Not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third.... on a ball hit to the wall that should be a stand-up double for the hitter, and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate!!!  Instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning, which explains why you can have 3 runs on 25 hits when the game is over and batting averages over .700 for the season!!  The AI (Artificial Intelligence) is absulutely horrible.  Ex. The computer has a runner on second base.  The hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the SS.  It takes the outfielder 10 seconds to get to the ball, which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield, and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time.  EVERY TIME!  The runner never scores from 2nd on a single.  The computer never steals bases.  The only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall.  Then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a stand-up.  At this point I was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last year's PS1 version.  If there is an improvement, it's that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat.  That may help control batting averages a bit.  You can still get 3 or 4 hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays.  I almost forgot.  I was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and couldn't find one.  So every time I hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double, the AI retreats my baserunner for me and I get one of the longest singles in baseball history.  There may be a way to change that but I haven't found it.  Nor will I because I'm probably not going to play it again.  The game still seems very choppy.  The player movements are still sub-par.  Ex.  You have 2 outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman.  He snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base, taps the bag, and jerks back into 1st base position without breaking stride.  He should be going to the dugout, the inning is over.  I haven't played to game enough to know if it still freezes with 2 outs in the 9th inning.  It probably does.  Ok, the commentary.  When are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they've been saying for years.  The little stories that Buck Martinez tells over and over again during the same game.  The sound of the game blows too.  I use to play baseball and never did I hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite.  Is this what EA Sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting?  You also can't change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off.  It plays the same verse over and over and over again.  You're ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin.  It's worse than the ""Magic Carpet Ride"" of last year's.  At least Madden 2001 allows you to turn that crap off.  There are almost no options in this game.  You cannot customize your gameplay.  No franchise mode (not that I'd use it anyway), or customized level of play.  I could easily win 150 of 162 games with an all-star setting.  I think EA Sports has sunk it's ship with this one.  The only EA Sports titles even worth playing are Madden and NHL, and both of those have their problems.  Don't waste your money even renting this one.  I'd love to have my $6.35 back.  So far I'm not impressed with PS2 sports titles, but their day is coming.  3DO's High Heat Baseball 2001 for PS1 is by far the best Baseball Simulation I have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay.  Awesome.  I have heard great things about Akklaim's All-Star Baseball series for the N64.  I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both, but if HH 2002 follows it's predecessor closely with a few minor changes, I will never need another baseball game.  As for EA Sports, sorry, but you need to get on it or get passed by your competition.  You no longer reign and your reputation is headed south.",EA Sports.... Please don't do this

B0026GQ8WA,1.0,"I've been setting on the sidelines for the better part of a year, waiting for the jasper Xbox 360s to come out.  Like many potential Xbox 360 buyers, I was hoping this was going to be an Elite Jasper release.  As the other reviews have stated, it's most likely not at all.

I decided to check out the local blue/yellow electronics store to get a first hand look at one of these.  They had four in stock and I got a look at two.  After fingering the serial number slot on these two I found one to be a Falcon (14.2 amps) and the other to be....drum roll please.... a Zephyr (16.5 amps)!  I had to do a double take to believe what I was seeing.  At that point, I decided to let the nice lady helping me pull them down from the overhead rack go about her business.  I didn't get a look at the manufacturing date because it wasn't on the labels and I would have had to tear up the inner cardboard liner to see it on the back of the console.  I did notice that the box was different between the two units.  The Falcon looked like the bundled games label was printed on the box.  The Zephyr box looked and felt like a sticker - you could feel bubbles under it.

Despite my disappointment with Microsoft, I'm probably going to go with a Resident Evil 5 special edition console to insure I get a Jasper unit.  Hey, maybe the fire engine red will add a splash of color to my living room!

UPDATE(5/26/09):  I ended up getting the Resident Evil 5 limited edition Xbox 360 Elite.  The unit is indeed based on the Jasper chipset.  It is fairly quiet and seems to run very cool.  After hours of gaming, the air coming out the vents on the back is barely warm.  However, the Resident Evil 5 game sucks...so the value of the combo is diminished in my opinion.  I think the Halo3/Fable 2 is a much better value if one has to have an Elite.  You just run the risk of getting the older, less reliable technology inside the unit.

Another reviewer believes that the 60 GB Pro version is a even a better deal.  In hindsight, I tend to agree. I only use my xbox to play games and watch netflix movies.  Even with several games installed, I've only used 40 GB of the 120 GB drive.  So for most users like myself, the 60 GB version is good enough.  Also, the issue of console color tends to come into play when purchasing an Elite.  The fact is the regular elite isn't really black....it's grey.  So I'm not sure how well it will match with the normal piano black home entertainment gear.",Sneaky Microsoft: Still Shipping Zephyrs!!!

B0050SXX88,1.0,"The graphics are excellent. Combat interaction and choice of guns excellent. But all of that is for naught when programmers create a game that is just not fun to play and does not reward you for progress. For example you go through an extremely difficult area and there is one little thing you forgot to do such as break a window to escape. And how do the programmers reward you? Even after you have killed the boss on that level you have to start at a check point that was about thirty minutes earlier! Then when you get to the check point it is like the programmers want to punish you for not getting through the first time by making the enemies twice as difficult to fight the second time around. And all because the player did not break a window! The programmers could have at least allowed the player to create there own save. But no it only automatically saves as points that make the game impossible to enjoy. A big thumbs down. I was expecting more of a game like Far Cry 2 that had a much better difficulty balance and enjoyable saves. The most enjoyable combat game that I have played for taking down  bad guys  is Killzone 4.

B000Q4VK86,1.0,"This game promised to be a realistic shooter, designed by the Army itself, that forced players to use tactics and teamwork in order to succeed- ostensibly to offer average gamers an appreciation of what it's like to be part of a real military unit. Sadly, the game utterly fails to deliver on that promise.

I would start by saying the graphics are last-gen but last-gen graphics would surely be insulted by such a statement. Characters and environments remind me of shooters from 8 or 10 years ago, no joke.

Sound was hit and miss, with the weapons fire/effects being pretty good but voice acting being horrible. In the interest of realism, NPCs call you by a nickname you choose from a list. ""Good idea, poor execution"" is this game's mantra as the result sounds more like a voice you might hear on an automated phone menu: ""Your hold time is- 'five' -minutes"". The straw that broke my patience's back was the incessant panting your character produces, even after only one or two steps.

Even worse is the frustratingly sluggish gameplay. Movement is jarring and imprecise. When starting to move from a standstill, your character must first ""wind-up"" in a fashion I simply cannot describe. The accompanying screen jerk made me want to vomit from motion sickness. Maneuvering in tight quarters simply isn't possible. The menu system is shockingly overcomplicated- actions as simple as changing weapons require a series of clicks and the resulting animation takes forever. The hit detection is an absolute farce- it took me 8 tries to hit a stationary cardboard tank with a rocket launcher from only a few feet away- the game simply did not recognise the first 7 hits.

The real knife in the back has to be the ""campaign,"" which is actually just more ""training"". You shoot ""bad guys"" (your allies dressed in costumes) with paintballs and the cheesy ""drill instructors"" follow you around, barking your objectives.

I always enjoyed playing the campaign in the original starcraft/brood war and that's what I mainly purchased this game for.  Even though it's only the Terran's race campaign, it was long and pretty fun.  The achievements and different difficulties allow for some replay but only if you have access to the internet.

When I purchased this game I did not know the campaign only had one race. I also didn't know that this game could not be played (even the campaign or any part of the game) without access to the internet.  You're basically shut out of the game if you don't have internet access.  I think there have been 3-4 patches since it has been released and this problem (PROBLEM, imo.. since it has an offline campaign) hasn't been acknowledged.

Almost everyone who can afford to have a capable computer and purchase this game will most-likely have a broadband connection.  I agree.  I'm still annoyed that this game cannot be used offline.  I had planned on playing the campaign over a weekend at my parents cabin but only to find out that Blizzard completely shuts out users who don't have internet access.

I happen to value my eyesight and looking at the blobs on the screen wasn't doing my eyes any good.
I was stunned that Electronic Arts, responsible for some excellent shooters (the Medal of Honor series, for example), produced this atrocity.  A game of the lowest quality.",Terrible.  No stars for either controls or graphics.

B009AGXH64,1.0,"No games on this console worth buying at even garage sale prices. This thing will on-and-off refuse to connect to the internet (and yes, I tried it on various networking devices). I probably spent an hour of online time in the vague 20 hours of use I got out of it. In the middle of one online session, the signal it was sending to the tv became a digital mess, and the gamepad lost connection. I tried various things, and even tried calling customer support. They have nice voices and attitudes, but I don't know if they have ears. I told them all the various things I tried, and they made me try them several times over.

I already disliked nintendo to begin with, but I got this console to play Sonic Lost World (as I am a fan of the series) and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate (with a friend who lives a fair distance away). If anyone else has the mindset to get a wiiu for any purpose, I would strongly advise against it. I just gave the console to a computer shop in the town I live in and I was able to get money for the games and gamepad, but it pales in comparison to the money I could've gotten selling it online. I pity the buyers out there paying any more than $40 for the controllers, let alone the console or games.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not so angry that I can't think. I'm not exaggerating at all, though, either. The only person I know other than myself who has a wiiu is that friend I wanted to play Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate with, and they also have constant connection problems.",No.

Half of the missions are impossible to finish unless you figure out some sort of gimmick. Most missions force you to research them on the Internet.
There is no sense of reality at all. For instance, at one point you are shooting into a giant frame of steel girders, but you can only fire when the ""doors"" are open, even though it's just a giant, open framework. There is a submarine that your weapons can't damage, so you have to lure enemy aircraft into crashing into it. Again, use the Internet to understand how to finish the missions.
Most missions have a wingman, and while you are trying to do your task, you often have to keep an eye on the wingman symbol to keep reminding them to go and do something. It's so distracting that it really detracts from the game.
The game introduces too many random elements of play. Instead of flying and shooting, some of the first things you do include tail gunning, using a bomb sight, and intercepting a train at just the right spot so that you can hover over it for several seconds. These might make nice diversions after several missions, but they are some of the first things you do and just add to the random, haphazard feel of the game.
There are several ""cheat codes"" available, but if you use them they lock out the achievements. I presume the cheat codes were released to make up for how difficult the game can be. Frankly, people ought to be able to finish a game. Publishers can certainly add some harder modes for re-playability, but it's just ridiculous to make a game difficult to understand just to add hours of play. On the plus side, the game rates your performance in each mission so you could re-play them for a higher rating. Also, your rating earns ""prestige points"" that are used to buy upgrades. You might find it necessary to earn more points just to get the upgrades for later missions.
The game booklet is worthless for understanding how to play the game. It doesn't explain how to use some of the more obscure controls and it doesn't explain the map symbols. You just have to play and lose until you gradually figure it out.
The plot is ridiculous. So ridiculous that it's annoying. The plot is explained through voice acting (not stellar, but I've heard worse) and artwork. Fairly crude.
Some of the missions are fairly enjoyable, as they aren't all timed and don't all require completing a bizarre task. But far too many of the missions are simply repeating the same frustrating sequence until you figure out some gimmick that isn't explained anywhere except an Internet post by someone who also got stuck.","many, many flaws"

B001PAAE7I,1.0,Mannever bet these to work more than 2 weeks.,Eventualy looses connection
B004WL4LOY,1.0,"If you go online to the game servers its a scam, the amount of time consumed when playing online is ridiculous the farming is hard the amount of rewards are rare and if you go on DLC psn network you know why, all the DLC combined is over 100 $150+ buy this and that such as increased drop rates, and have it lasts for 30 days only, a lot of the best gaming is supposed to be done online but at a high price, the game is a 2/5 at best such a game should not be so hard to play online with all that grinding, You've been warned its a serious grind game just as bad as world of warcraft, I'm a hardcore gamer but this game White knight chronicles is only just okay offline. The moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had. A lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves. Trust a real person a real gamers  review, I will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it, go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesn't make sense, its very anti-climactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful online.

So when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to, I gave up playing this online as the game isn't good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming. Just to make your gear/outfit/armor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance, such as I'm wearing a cool armor and weapon but I make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on, just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game???

A lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying, I'm sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing, this is what happens when you force people to spend more than 300 hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time. Imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops, you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending 1-2 hours or more in it and the boss doesn't drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon? You catch my point in games like this thats not an MMORPG massively multi-player online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a 100% drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over. A note to the developers this game isn't an MMORPG so don't try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n over.

The game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get, and the game isn't rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armor/weapon. The music in the game is just below average, the storyline super cliche, The graphics are just slightly better than Playstation 2 quality, the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons, but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really I'm going to farm 400 hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics? No thank you. I completed the game and the sequel because I'm one of those hardcore gamers even though I don't like a game if i find something of small interest in it I will continue to play it till i finish it, but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isn't worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay. The problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete. Having to spend months to a year or so on one game... that to me is just super lame.

If you want a decent RPG that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a 400-500+ hours of pointless grinding/farming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank me.

I miss the days of Grandia, Final fantasy 6-7-8-X, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Secret of mana, Star ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile, Zelda 1, 3 and Ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there. So you guys know I'm for real a hardcore rpg fan since the release of Zelda 1 NES and even further back Heavy on the magic keyboard adventure game on the Amstrad.","Scam, Grind, Farming."

B003O6N74S,1.0,"I've been playing WoW since beta phase 2, so well over 6 years. I have the panda collector original edition pet, and every collector pet since then. I have 5 level 80 characters of which one is a day from 85 and the others are all ranged dps so they will take about a week each to get to 85, since they all started in t10+ gear. So I have experienced every little bit of WoW short of the level 85 experience.

Whats wrong with Cataclysm ? Well, if you aren't a Goblin newbie, everything. The content is moderately interesting, but the quest engine is badly broken. Let me say from the outset that quite a few have completed all the quests in Vash, Deep, and Hyjal. But a huge number of players got halfway through the quest chain in both Vash and Deep and then could no longer find NPCs giving quests. The GMs say it is a known bug and is being worked on, but this means the only way to level pretty much is random dungeons. And these days, with so many in the same fix, the wait queue for a random dungeon team can run well over 10 minutes. For a healer!

And since questing has ALWAYS been the premier attraction of WoW expansions (only way you can experience the unveiling of the Lore) it is quite clear Blizzard really let us all down on this. Frankly, if you are just starting, just buy the base game, or even Wrath of the Liche King, which plays great up to level 80, and the quest chain works all the way to 80 and beyond. Until you are a Northrend master.

Don't buy this expansion, Blizzard doesn't deserve the money until they fix the game to deliver what was promised!",What a disappointment
B00009OY9U,1.0,"I bought this back in may 2017. I use it strictly for Star Wars Galaxy. This stick is fantastic for the JTL content.  The buttons are easily mapped and stick is stiff, but responsive. Perfect for PVP.  My gripe though seems to be a common one after doing a lot of homework on way my ship was constantly rolling to the left. The twist function within the joystick doesn't seem to be durable as I've had to set up a return order.  Now this is where I really am annoyed.

Logitech, one of the largest accessory companies has been absolutely horrible about the claim I filed.  I've been waiting days on end for a response and was forced to go go back to amazon.com to see what they'd suggest.  To my surprise, Amazon went and ok'd the return due to the manufacturer not being supportive.  Big Kudos to Amazon.

Overall: maybe I just got a bad joy..  I really like the stick during the first few months of ownership. It's comfortable and ofters a wide variety of buttons that's convenient for your casual flyer. I've seen other sticks with separate throttle and buttons on this, but to be honest, i'm a lazy pilot and I don't want to have to figure out 2 controls vs having everything on one package. If something could be done about the poor durability for the twist function,  I think you would have a product, but like I said, maybe it's just a defective joy.

UPDATE:  11/14 -- Upon ordering a replacement, that was fulfilled by Amazon.com for a new replacement. I received a clunky oversized box and the joystick in a bag. No packing materials like popcorn. Needless to say, being livid is an understatement.  It's busted too.  Amazon has issued a refund for #2.

Honestly...  Don't buy this.  No joystick is worth this much headache.",I want to love this joystick but my experience has left me jaded.

B00ZJRHSZO,1.0,"This remote seems to be getting a lot of hate and after pairing it with my PS4 and getting some time to setup and operate the remote it gets a middle-of-the-road score from me. A lot of complaints surrounding this remote are totally valid but I still found the remote to be fairly decent and it does have some redeeming qualities.

The Bad:
(-) Overall I don't particularly like the form factor of the remote. It's much smaller than the PS3 BT remote control that came before it and as a result many of the buttons are tiny. In particular the PS4 face buttons are tiny and poorly positioned making them difficult to use.

(-) For a remote with such small keys you'd think there would be a backlighting feature. But no such luck. Finding extra small keys in a darkened room while watching a movie sucks.

(-) The remote is missing buttons you'd expect to have. None of the shoulder buttons (L1, R1, etc) get a button.

(-) Much like the PS3 BT remote if PS4 is the selected device on this remote any button acts like a power button and turns on the PS4.

(-) Batteries (2x AAA) are not included.

The Good:
(+) I do like the button click when a button is pressed. It's much more tactile than on the PS3 BT remote.

(+) Volume Punch-through is very easy to setup and controls the volume on the TV (a Panasonic plasma in my case) even when another device is selected (e.g. PS4).

(+) Setting up the universal control features was pretty easy - either by manually inputting remote codes or using the learning feature (covered in the included instructions).

--------------------
UPDATE 11/17/2015:
--------------------
I've had the chance to use the PS4 Universal Remote more and more with my PS4, mainly using Netflix and Amazon VOD, and now I'm understanding the hate this remote gets. So two major issues have cropped up and unless there's a dramatic turnaround I'm probably going to scrap this remote altogether. Also, changing my review from 3 to 1-star.

Issue #1: BT Connectivity -
After initially working without issues my remote now seemingly cannot stay paired. The remote seems to enter rest-mode but has trouble waking. I end up having to push random buttons in the hopes of finally getting the remote to wake and work.

Issue #2: Battery Drain -
I'm on my second pair of brand new AAA batteries. The last pair of fresh batteries was put in the remote and less than 24-hrs later the remote (through the PS4) reported that it was low on battery power.",Some Good Some Bad With This Remote - Updated 11/17/15

Single player mode can have two extreems, easy or hard. Those aren't selectable settings, but the way you choose to play. At each ""level"" your character becomes immediately involved in a large battle, your character is one of many fighting this battle and there are no specific goals other than taking over command post. You can elect to piloting ships, steal an AT-AT etc.. but this really only serves to bring  a loose bit of freedom. It makes the game a giant mush without any order to it. You can fall back and let the computer controlled team mates win the level for you or you can engage in combat and (usually) be destroyed almost immediately. Bottom line, this is a poor game.

Don't believe the hype - leave this one on the shelf and if curiosity gets the better of you then buy it used (there'll be plenty around let me assure you).  Don't reward the providers of this game by paying list price for it - it'll only encourage them to come out with more sub-standard products.

B00EFRN2IQ,1.0,"Updated. I hate this game even more even with mods and cheats it is still boring and so limited. Again. I am only giving it a chance because I paid too much money for it.

I still do like the game just a tiny bit and that is only because of what you can do in Create A Sim and some more detailed interactive content that I wish was in SIms 2.

Though they may have seemed like a great idea before but emotions are overrated and very annoying. Come on, why is she NOW tense from a fire at a neighbors house that happened an hour ago? Depending how your Sims are feeling you have to stop everything and go off and do something just to appease their emotions and it is a waste of time because you're only going around in circles. It's hard enough building skills and relationships without have to drop everything to go and kick a trash can on the far other end of the park. That's only a tidbit.

Content, as far as design. I still don't know what Maxis is doing. Why does Maxis still have a problem putting together color schemes and proper furniture sets? I don't know where to begin with that but nothing matches or go together. Everything looks 2D while the Sims are in 3D if that makes sense. However, I do like the way you can arrange decorative items without the diagonal cheat. So basically I liked the design tools.

Game play wise everything is at a stand still all the time. It's still amazing how you can do so much and it amounts to so little.
I still can't believe I bought this game for this amount when Sims 2 was cheaper and you got more out of it. Even the Sims 2 base game alone was enjoyable. The amount of content that was taken from this game is ridiculous. What content they took out were these to name a few; police, firemen, repo man, nanny, toddlers, aliens, telescopes, burglars, the ability to customize lots, family tree, basements, they added the pools back in but they are still limited for example no diving boards and there's so more gone. It may not seem like much but these features had content that came with them that made them and the Sims game more fun. Which this game is not. I wish they instead of releasing this game, delayed it and made something great out of it and not leave stuff out just to charge customers for it later at a high price. I would gladly pay 60 dollars for Sims 4 if it was worth it and not lacking the basics that was even in Sims 2 base game.

Origin is another story. It took 24 hours to install, each and every time. I purchased this back in Dec. 2014 and I don't know how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled Sims 4. Too many times I think. I know I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game so many times I've threatened to break these **** disks. This last time (around July) Origin updated itself and then I was no longer able to play the game so I uninstalled it. I had no choice, every time. I just reinstalled it (Aug. 30th) and this time around I make sure not to be online so it won't update otherwise I have to deal with it breaking again. I've played a total of 25 hours of game play since buying it and that was last year. Origin as a game launcher just sucks. I don't see the purpose of having to be online to play a game I purchased that's meant to be played offline. I don't care about somebody else content if I want it I would download it myself.  I'd per fer the old Sims launcher anyways. This is the last time I'll ever buy anything regarding the Sims 4.
So anyone interested I say, save your money instead and if you still have your Sims2 or Sims3 games just install the downloads, mods and programs for any new content you want and there you go, you've just made your own Sims4 how it should be.",I thought this was suppose to be an updated version of ALL the Sims games and then some.
B0000C7GHG,1.0,"Went and bought this for Xmas. Worked fine, then the next week, ""Disc Read Error""? WTH?!!. Even though I read about this from other owners, I decided to take a chance. Never again. People poke fun at the older sytems, but my Playstation 1 has never, ever failed me, and I almost traded it in for this crap. My other older systems, such as the SNES, Genesis and N64 have performed well without any problems. I took this back and will stick with the ol' skool systems. But then again, I guess I'm not a ""real"" gamer until I own an XBOX or PS2, right?

B00DB9JV5W,1.0,"I am done with Halo after this game.  The series has been sliding down hill but it done plunged off of a cliff.  I am beyond annoyed at the lack of split-screen co-op.  This game makes enough money that for the developer to cry about limited resources in not developing split screen is just a load of bull.  It's probably more about them wanting to squeeze some people into paying for Xbox Live Gold and 2 copies of the game at our expense.  The story is not relevant to anything you do in the game.  It's just an annoyance actually and very superficial.  For some reason, they have almost totally gotten into making almost all of the enemies promethians who are just freaking boring, with much less covenant and absolutely none of my favorite, the Flood.  I know I am old, but my favorite Halo level is still the Library from Halo:Combat Evolved.  Those Flood dudes with their heads half fallen off and the alien looking things on their faces were creepy.  And they just came in droves and flew out of everywhere.  And then the little Flood buggers were annoying in a fun way.  The worlds were so much more open.  They get more linear with every Halo release.  Vehicles are barely used and when they are it is almost for show so they can just say they are there.  Theres nothing like driving around trying to find and rescue the stranded Marines in the first Halo.

This just feels like yet another step in the steady progression of video games away from a decent single player campaign and total abandonment of local co-op play so that they can get us all online.  I'm sure the next Halo will add microtransactions.  Isn't that the way this is all heading?  Kind of like how GTA has now abandoned any additional single player campaign material for the very shallow GTA online world where for whatever reason apparently people spend real money to get the latest release of purple pin-striped pajamas to wear while they do the same missions over and over again.

It just makes me sad.  Video games used to be fun.",A sad step toward the destruction of the single player campaign and local co-operative play and my last Halo game.

B000056Q0P,1.0,"This thing is about as ergonomic as a prison bench. The ability to change it from a right handed controller to a left handed one seems like a good idea, but it came with too high a price. -Four of the control buttons are located directly in front of the stick, hard to reach anyway, but they're only about a mile away from the throttle control; useless for those `I gotta hit this button now or I will die' moments every gamer faces. Because once you move your fingers from the throttle waaaaayyy down to the f1-f4 buttons, its all over. They did this, logically, to save the expense of having to place opposite, mirroring buttons beneath both the right and left throttle ports.
  Speaking of throttle....the wheel based throttle control has about 45 degrees of travel between zero and maximum, way too much for comfort. It forces the user to stretch out the arm too far, which, over hours of gameplay can really become uncomfortable.
  The stick itself: No doubt you've noticed from the pictures, there's this strange looking protrusion from the back of the stick? `What could this be?' One ponders upon first glance. Well, I shall not keep you in suspense....This little plastic protrusion is an incredibly intelligent and novel idea gone sadly awry. The upright `u' shaped piece is designed to nicely support your hand, the big muscle beneath you thumb sits atop it, while the flat portion of this device supports the edge of your hand. It's a great idea executed poorly.  Because of its placement, your hand always ends up coming away from the most comfortable resting position in favor of better stick control.  It would work very well, if the human body did not have shoulders, that is.  This resting point can be moved up and down according to you preference, but it's just another feature I found completely useless-it stayed where it was when I took it out of the box ...All this thick quagmire of discomfort results in one thing- sore wrists and elbows.
  The trigger is pretty nice, performs well and is, unfortunately, the most functional thing about this controller.  There are three buttons atop the sticks head, they're very easy to hit, in fact, too easy to hit. Often the user will find themselves executing commands because they've accidentally hit one or more of these buttons. Like most controllers, there is an eight way point of view or `hat' switch up top too. -It works, but it too is much too sensitive due to the length of its design, which gives your finger too much leverage on it and makes it very easy to press sideways when you wanted to press upwards.
  The customizable features of this controller make it unique; It's a fantastically intelligent idea.  Too bad Saitek didn't do some research and development utilizing HUMAN hands.  The head has three positions: Straight up, angled left, and angled right. I found it to be absolutely, positively, useless. -It stayed straight for my gaming needs; the angled positions just made it easier to accidentally hit the three buttons up top. Not something this controller needs.  There are also three up and down angle positions, which is nice, because you never know when you might want to put the top control buttons as far away as possible so you can place your hand in slightly different uncomfortable position to even out the aches in your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. I mean, hey, why not make your thumb uncomfortable too? Just to be consistent.
  Overall construction isn't terrible: It won't fall apart if you drop it. But if you're buying this for your teenager or tend to destroy controllers yourself, look for something a little more substantial. Even the base is lightweight plastic.
  Now that I've said everything bad about this controller, how about some of the good: The handling of the stick is very good. There is a nice spring at the base of the stick, making excellent, consistent resistance....which translates to good in-game control.  The spring also is responsible for returning the stick to center, and it does a dang fine job of it. Twist control, too, is very responsive, and it returns to center very well, which means your gaming screen only rolls or twists when you want it too. ...The only other good thing I can think of about this controller is...um...well...it looks cool, doesn't it?
  To summarize things: This controller incorporates some very novel, intelligent ideas but executes them about as well as an albatross makes a landing.",Awkward and dissapointing
B006IUVDOS,1.0,"Would you buy a new car that is missing basic standard features like airbags, power steering and power windows?  Yes, you could still drive the car, but it would be a lousy experience and a waste of your money.  That analogy applies here.  Final Fantasy XIV is missing too many basic features.  Add to that the severe lack of content, and you have one game that was simply not ready for release.  It needed about another 6 months.  If this game was still a beta, these issues could be forgiven or understandable.  But since you have to PAY for this mess, its absolutely fair to say this game is not ready.  All the criticism is warranted.

Pros: Great graphics, if your PC can handle it.
Cons: Horrible UI, Lack of content, missing many basic features, boring world, lack of real quests, too much lag, and worst of all, just not fun.

You can adjust the controls for all of the Grand Theft Auto games on the PC. But The Matrix Path of Neo and Scarface, you cannot adjust the controls. I am completely unwilling to sit through more than 2 hours of either of these games if I can't adjust the controls to my preferences. I can't have any fun shooting, running, driving, or performing combo attack moves with the preset controls on either game. The controls are awkward! They don't feel right.

B005H40K7W,1.0,"Ubisoft initially stated it would be an ""activate once"" DRM, then today reneged. I found this out the hard way, and even better, the game refuses to activate since I apparently have ""no connection,"" despite being able to download, install the game, and write this review. So, I have not played the game, and I'm writing this review because of the ineptitude put into the game's execution, and my inability to even activate the game. If Ubisoft's DRM servers are failing, or the game's DRM itself, I don't know, but this is what happens when you always require a ""phone home"" DRM, and it doesn't work: legitimate buyers are screwed.

B000GBOSZ6,1.0,"There is no doubt that The Legend of Zelda video gaming series is one of Nintendo's greatest accomplishments, in which a character named Link would fight to save the land and the people, primarily from Ganon. Each of the games has been praised as a classic throughout the years, from its humble beginnings in The Legend of Zelda to the most recent three-dimensional adventures.

For each game series, there's always bound to be a black sheep to show up. One of these black sheep is called ""Link: Faces of Evil"", in which Link must defeat Ganon, save Zelda, and become the almighty hero of Koridai. Sounds like your typical Legend of Zelda game, but it's a far cry from it.

First off, the graphics are just plain terrible, especially during the cutscenes. (You can most likely find them on YouTube, they're so bad they're hilarious.) It shows that Philips were given limited time with the development, so it obviously looks rushed. The game controls are awful as well, as they don't respond well at all. Plus I hate to spoil it all, but to defeat Ganon, all you do is throw the Book of Koridai at him and then you've saved the princess. There's no effort put into this game, this is just a cheap way for Philips to exploit some of Nintendo's characters and turn them into a complete joke of themselves.

It's funny how this game became very valuable, despite Nintendo only acknowledging for cursory input and that the game is poorly produced. Nintendo disregarded this title (as well as the two other Zelda CD-i titles) for a reason.",Not Even a Legit Title in the Series

Moreover, its characters are dull and uninspired (even its introduction scenes are bland). Aspyr should have never released this monstrosity.

B0012N746W,1.0,"I read the requirements before I bought this product. The PC software seems to have flaws to say the least. Both of my PC's have had more than what was asked for, for pre installation and still doesn't work. I even bought an online download of this game with no luck. I have over a week of correspondence with securROM and nothing makes it work. I guess I will not play this game; the disc has been on my shelf and I guess it's time I just bite it and toss it in the circle file (trash can).

I guess there is some kind of check that was not built into the PC software package to see what drivers it likes and what drivers it doesn't.

I wish I could have experienced that game, but my experiences has bee null thus the single star since there is no blank star to choose from.

Update: secuROM - troubleshooting company for this software

it took me about a month of back and forth emails with secuROM for them to fix the game. It turns out that the *.exe file wasn't working with any of my system OS's (xp nor 7). They told me it was a corrupt file on the disk. Huh? The new file was about 4kb's bigger. I tried about 3 different exe files before I got the last fix. They even tried to have me download, from a 3rtd party site, a fix; and the site explicitly stated 'for European systems only'. I had to reply to them to tell them, ""look, it is for European systems only and in your reply you are stating to me that it's at my own risk? And you totally disregarded the download-sites warning for Euro system only?""

Sounds like a bug to me and not corrupt software. They also, in troubleshooting and making me do things again and again, asked me about some software files/software conflicts that I might have been using (e.g. some kind of hacking software that allows me to use pirated copies of games); none of which were on my system but they seemed to assumed that I had it anyway. I had to research their type of questioning to find out what they were really asking to figure out their type of line of questioning. So now I have to assume that any time I am conversing with customer service, with regards to the gaming industry, they assume I am using illegal/hacked/ copies of the game and using some type of virtual drive. Can I get any more jaded after this?

1)Forget about ""free to play"", ""no monthly fee"" lies - you have a high tier tank (8-10)? - prepare to spend $50+/month for ammo/repairs after each battle - if you don't you can still enjoy your first tank in the game -tier 1 -good luck !!! (Pay for battle is based on your performance and my stats are well above the average player so how come my Jagdtiger cannot make enough money after killing half of the opposite team ??? it used to make much much more but hey - they balanced the game)
2)""Adjustments"" made to the game to ""balance"" it help ""wallet warriors"" even more - you have money for gold ammo (yes in addition to premium acount which is $15/month and premiums tanks that go for up to $80 you can buy gold ammo for EVERY battle)- you win !!!
3)They talked a lot about making the graphics look better - well they do a little bit - still game looks like it has about 8 years not 2.
4)Sound - nothing special - boring...
5)PEOPLE - so many noobs signed up that at least half of your battles will feel like everyone is playing the game for the first time. Other than that many are very rude and offensive.

B000FUG5WC,1.0,"Wow I made the mistake of buying this piece of garbage before playing it because of the lack of RPGs for the XBOX 360! Hey I was desperate!

Having said that, this game is absolutely awful.

First off the the story and dialogue will bore you to suicide.

the dialogue is so tedius and meaningless its just a waste of time. The apparently ""Gay"" member of your group will sit and talk about how in love he is with the other male character for way too long and other conversations that have nothing to do with gameplay take way too long.

Graphic wise this game is not what you'd expect from a huge console like the 360, it looks like a PS2 game and not even a good one.

Also the battles are boring. I have played RPGs and turn based games for years and the combat on this game is uninspired  and just flat out lame.

Alot of this game is way too drawn out. conversations and movies and boring and have no story value and take forever to get through. Dont get me wrong sometimes a long cutscene is cool if its telling the story and is exciting and well done. these are not like that at all.

basically there might be some people out there who might dig this but I dont. Id rather play any of the Final Fantasy games or any of the other turn based RPGS out there. This was just a waste of $59 in my opinion. If they are going to charge that much for games for this system they better be really good because PS2 games are cheaper and last i checked they had better RPGS for alot less money.

B00006ZLOX,1.0,"It's not every day that I advocate video games becoming more derivative, but in the case of ""Jeopardy!"", I'll make an exception.

I've played a lot of video-game versions of ""Jeopardy!"", which has gotten easier to adapt as video game technology has improved.  In the early 90's, the Sega Genesis version was a nightmare to play, as you had to spell out answers in their entirety with just a D-pad and three easily-confused buttons (for ""select letter"", ""delete letter"", and ""accept"").  Games took well over an hour to play and punished players who accidentally submitted incomplete responses by pushing the wrong button.  Worse, there was no way for the cartridge to remember which questions had already been used, so you always risked getting repeat questions, which killed the fun and novelty of the game.

The CD-i version (of all things!) in 1995 was a breakthrough by substantially solving these problems.  First, it had a list of ""completions"", so after entering a few letters of your response, you could see it matching an alphabetical list of possible answers, and just arrow over and pick the completion.  This dramatically sped up game play.  The other fix was that the game could use the small (8KB?) built-in memory of the CD-i player to log which questions had already been used, effectively eliminating repeat questions.  With the copious CD storage, it was also possible to read the questions aloud -- while not necessary, it was a nice touch.  The only flaw was that the controller 1 had a clear and obvious advantage over controller 2 when ringing in.

The PlayStation ""Jeopardy!""s polished the ""completion"" system of the CD-i version, and saved the question usage stats to the memory card.  In other words, it didn't fix what wasn't broken... it just took ""Jeopardy done right"" to a wide audience than would have seen the CD-i version.

And now, the PlayStation 2 version arrives with this history of ""Jeopardy!"" video game evolution behind it... and promptly proceeds to ignore it.  While it uses a sensible completion system for entering answers, it makes the stunningly boneheaded move of NOT saving stats about question usage to the memory card, allowing repeat questions to appear at potentially any time (at least the Genesis version allowed you to reject categories you knew you'd already seen - Atari's PS2 version isn't even that smart).  What the heck were the Atari engineers and producers thinking?  Apparently, they were too focused on features nobody really needs, like having CPU contestants answer with actual audio replies instead of on-screen text (memo to Atari: nobody cares).

Increasingly powerful systems should allow ""Jeopardy!"" to become more like the actual game show with each generation -- eventually, the game should be able to use a microphone and speech recognition technology to let players speak their answers aloud.  But more important than the technology is a basic competence and awareness of gameplay issues, of fun, that this game screws up with the single avoidable mistake of not logging question usage to avoid repeat questions.",A huge step backwards

After realizing that this game wasn't going great like Civ 1-4, I thought how could this happen?  Perhaps I'll like the game more after playing it a bit more, but I didn't.

2. Anger
How could Firaxis do this?  I was so excited about the release of Civ 5.  I even planned to take a few days off work to play it.  Who in Firaxis can I give a piece of my mind to?  Grrr!

3. Bargaining
Maybe I can return the game?  Maybe I can sell it on Craigslist?  Nope, thanks to Steam, I can't sell it.  Damn.

4. Depression
Is this really the end of the beloved Civ franchise?  Can they actually bounce back from this?  I really doubt it.  I won't be pre-ordering Civ 6 to get game map packs, trust me on this.

5. Acceptance
Well, Firaxis got my $50, but I guess I really got so much out of the previous Civ games, I guess I won't feel too bad.  I'll go back to Civ 4 and 3 when I want my Civ fix.  Even Civ Colonization was a better game than Civ 5.  Heck, even Call to Power was likely better than Civ 5.

B000GG1OXA,1.0,"Star Wars Galaxies has been repackaged and resold several times since it came out in 2002/2003.  The first ""re-release"" came about about the time of Episode 3.  About 6 months later, the game was re-released as the ""NGE"" i.e. ""New Game Experience"".  After upsetting its player base to the point of a mass exodus to other games such as World of Warcraft, EvE Online, and others - SOE redesigned the game *AGAIN* and has re-released it in this ""Complete Adventures"" set.  About six months ago it was the ""Starter Kit"".  And in about another month it will be released *AGAIN* as part of the  ""Best of Star Wars"" gift set.

This game is in perpetual Alpha/Beta state depending on how much code they delete between patches.  It is not fun at all anymore.  I made a lot of friends through the original SWG - but they have been milking the Star Wars license for all its worth to comedic dramatic effect - culminating in embarrassing gaffes on the Game Channel ""Attack of the Show"" as well as CBS Specials detailing some of the atrocities committed by SOE - and also written articles and a ""mailbag"" special.

Most of the players who had any sort of self-repsect whatsoever left a long time ago.

The only people playing this game right now can be equated to the women who go back to their abusive husbands because he promises not to beat them again.

It is only a matter of time before you have to tell your parents that you ""Fell down the stairs"" the next time you beat your head into your computer desk after SOE pulls the rug out from under you with a new ""Star Warsy"" ""enhancement"" that negates most of your time spent with your character in-game.

Things have gotten so bad with the server population that SOE has given all characters an extra character slot per server... something that used to be reserved for players which earned certain rewards in-game.

You can be a Jedi out of the box... but your powers are so ridiculously weak, and your lightsaber so flaccid that you will lose fights to the most ridiculous creatures... cavemen, correllian butterflies, and all sorts of other ""dangerous"" beasts.

If you have any self-respect whatsoever - don't even try this game.  I can honestly and 100% say that I would not play this game if they paid *me* twice the monthly fee you have to pay them... it is that horrible.",Ever wonder why this game is re-released every 3 - 6 months?

B00069BUXG,1.0,"Intec's line of products really don't hold up well, and this is no exception.

Everything you get in hear besides the car charger are terrible, so just get the car charger itself.  But since you probally want to know, here's why.

The screen protectors are actually a poorly made piece of cardboard that will leave a whole thing of sticky stuff behind.  It's an awful screen protector that actually fell off the first day I got it.  The headphones have no bass, don't go loud, and are uncomfortable.  They broke after a week.  So my advice is to get the car charger seperate, as well as some great headphones from Bose, Sony, Phillps, whatever.  And as for the screen protectors, get one that costs about seven bucks, as they are expensive, but will do a great job in protecting your screem from light, and making the life of it longer.

B00DBKSN8M,1.0,"This was a long awaited title and one of the most hyped launches of its kind ever, and for that reason I found it brutally disappointing. Its just 2-bit gangsters in LA California all over again. Somewhere new would have been nice for starters. The location and the plot is just too repetitious for a title this big! So why not change the theatre to Space, Underwater, History? I don't care, just something new! Why not be brave and even set the next game in.......China: ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Don't like those? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Still don't like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to some travel, you definitely have the resources!

The same 2-bit characterless gangster portrayals bring few surprises either. In fact this game does no one any favours. Hello? The world has moved on! My lady has a suggestion for a change of plot. Why not use the film Taken (2008) as a base? ...Justifiable on-screen violence against bad guys trafficking women. There's an emotional angle too for anyone interested in emotioneering in video-gaming! It would be better than dumb gangsters bring cynical corporate profits! Some people might think this is unduly harsh, but the video gaming talent pool is unbelievably high. However, GTA V is more like Hollywood and its endless cycle of reboots, reshoots and sequels.

Sure, the GTA V map terrain is a little more detailed, the mountains have higher peaks, and the cars look and handle a bit better. But Driver-SF still pips it with a higher frame-rate, and Saints Row III is just more fun. The rest is just bland, bland, bland. They've long run out of ideas, much like the twin-studios that kick out Call-Of-Duty titles every year on a corporate schedule! Yes, there are 3 GTA characters to follow this time, each with their own special skill, but its so gimmicky its not even half-hearted RPG. Overall, 3 messes just make more of a mess! No thanks!

========================================
Update April 2014
========================================

To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...

First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).

The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!

Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!

I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!

Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.

There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped.",Italy?... China?... Underwater?.... Space? ... No its seedy 'LA' all over again

And right after the 1st month of NORMAL USE! (average 30hrs in 2 weeks of CSGO, and regular browsing), the left click broke! It started with being harder to click, and a day later it just broke. I have been reading online and this is fairly a common issue for a lot of people, which disappoints me to no end. I refuse to throw $60 down the drain so all I can do is RMA from Razer and wait for the next one to break as well within 1-2 months. I will never again buy ANY Razer product.

B01GKGVIB2,1.0,"I would've given this two stars, but there's entirely too much to hate as compared to the original.

I absolutely loved the first TF. When I heard they were launching it, I nearly lost my mind. Then, I played the beta. I was beyond heartbroken. They essentially gutted the spirit of what made TF1 so beautiful. They essentially remade the game into something akin to a Call of Duty: Black Ops in Space

So, against my better judgment, I bought the game anyway. I played the multiplayer for about four hours. I seriously wanted nothing more than to like the sequel. I even tried to force myself to play it for about 2-hours longer than when I became bored.

ARTWORK

Some things are better looking such as the lobby animations. However, overall, the artwork doesnt give that detailed gritty feeling that you got from the original. Theres a lot less detail and the maps are much smaller.

Furthermore, the maps are NOT geared towards the parkour movement of the original. The maps are just not well designed for the feel of what one would expect to be a Titanfall branded game.

In TF-1, the colors are muted and realistic looking. In TF-2, things look cartoony with a loud color palette. You feel like you're at an arcade playing one of those shooters with the toy rifles and everything is just coming at you in all the colors of the rainbow.

GAMEPLAY

Instead of a blanket upgrading system where your upgrades allow you access to certain weapons, theyve added more granularity by making weapons upgradable as well. So, you might start with a Level 1 rifle that can be leveled up and upgraded accordingly. This is while you're leveling up as a pilot which allows you access to more advanced weapons in each class.

The titans weapons and characteristics cannot be interchangeable in the way that we saw with TF1. Some of the secondary abilities can be changed. However, titans can be upgraded within the context of their static loadout. So, what you see is what you get for the most part. I actually like that I could use three different chassis and arm them with customizable loadouts. To me, this seemed like a better way to adapt/develop the choices to ones play style. With TF-2, I pretty much have to commit to a certain Titan vs a certain package of features.

The final straw for me was the implementation of the shield dome. In TF-1, if you called on a Titan, youd have a shield dome protecting the Titan for a short period of time. You could get a Titan customization that could extend this time. Now, in TF-2, you either get the shield dome or the titan warp customization. Why is this important? If you're trying to make a tactical move involving a Titan that you cant immediately jump into, then you're SOL. Your Titan falls and is immediately taking damage.

There aren't as many of the Grunts and Androids to kill. I liked these because it was cool to shoot them. Many dislike the Smart Pistol, but I loved it as a primary weapon. It actually increased the hazard of the warzone. It made you a better player if someone was using it against you and there wasn't a guarantee that you would dominate if you were using it. Now, its been completely neutered as a perk that can only be used with 24 rounds. Wow. Just wow.

Speaking of primary weapons. Heres where the absurdity of the game decisions reaches a pinnacle. Pilots can ONLY carry a primary weapon and  wait for it  a pistol OR anti-titan weapon!!! So, yeah, you run out of ammo on your primary weapon and no quick switching to a nice pistol if you want to kill Titans also. So, theyve effectively neutered the pilot. [Game developers, what were you thinking?]

CUSTOMIZATION

Theyve added more customization abilities such as the ability to reskin your weapons and your Titan. This includes patches and team names. What I don't like about it is that it seems like they just through this feature on without much thought on the actual UI. Its a bit confusing to implement.

Did I say you can only have two weapons at a time while a pilot? Primary + pistol or primary + Anti-Titan?

SUMMARY

I could go on about other things. This game feels like they fired the original team during early development. Then hired a whole new team that never worked on or played the original. This new team was confused so they looked over the notes of the previous team and then made the best game that they could. Another theory is that since they went multiplatform, they couldn't use Microsoft's  Azure cloud abilities to do much of the heavy backend lifting as was the case in the original. Hence, they had to make a lite game and used the COD: Black Ops resources/model to fill in the gaps.","If Youre Passionate About Titanfall 1, Then DO NOT Get Titanfall 2!"
B000WU35JQ,1.0,"Functionality:

My Lachesis has never worked 100%. Even after installing the most up to date drivers and firmware, the pointer will still skip up to the top of the screen. It seems to happen a lot when im using my right mouse button to move my game camera around.

The programibility and macro functions of this mouse are on par with any other gaming mouse, so nothing special there.

Ergonomics:

This mouse takes a while to get use to, the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse. Its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse, and so the steep learning curve (many days) is truely a negative.

The button placement on the right side are such that they are next to useless.

Ease of use:

Out of the box you must go online to update the firmware/drivers.

You must make sure your mouse pad remains clean from lint and hair as this affects this mouse more so then other mice.

Conclusion:

Look im not saying this mouse is a useless piece of junk. What I am saying is this mouse was a huge waste of money. At the time I purchased it, it was $80 and it has NEVER worked 100% I paid to get a top quality gaming mouse, and instead got a buggy product that isn't much better then any run of the mill $20 mouse.

I went to the Steam support pages like I was told to, and I read this:

""... you must have a copy of your purchase receipt from within the last 90 days to have the CD Key moved to your account.

""We do not accept receipts from online auction websites or used software vendors. If you do not provide a purchase receipt, Valve will not be able to transfer the CD Key.""

I can't believe that anyone accepts this as a reasonable way to sell consumers a game in a box, but I guess they do!

I read a thread on some Half-Life 2 forum where the users were telling a guy not to bother Valve, the software creators, with questions about their policy, but rather just to return his used game to whoever he bought it from.

Unbelievable!

From what I hear, maybe if I send the right person at Valve an actual photo of my box, and wait two months, I might be allowed to play.  However, that's certainly not what the text on the Steam support page says.

B00000JRSB,1.0,"All right, listen up all you so-called video game ""experts"" and ""critics!"" Let me give you the lowdown on Final Fantasy VII.
For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen.
Other than that this game is tolerable considering today's standards. But they will never be able to compete with FF VII's soundtrack, it is beyond competition.

B0012N94WO,1.0,"As a huge fan of the Resident Evil franchise, I couldn't wait for this to come out. Now that it has, I realize this game was all hype and no substance. For starters, the controls are VERY awkward. You spend time thinking about how you will execute the movement in parts of the game when they should just come natural. The biggest flaw design is that the designers have set up the game play where you must decide what items you want to use for each chapter BEFORE you begin the chapter. This seems fine at first, but as you play the game, they don't even give you the option to drop ANY items! So once you are full you are STUCK with them. How stupid is this??? Then there is the story. The designers decided to tie ALL the Resident Evil stories together to give it a sense of ""full circle"". Initially this seemed intriguing, but then as you play the game, the SAME old bosses that you encountered in Resident Evil 4 are here too. You attack one and the little creatures spring out from his back or head. Gee, didn't see that one coming. But what really got me was their decision to go from a night time horror game to a daylight one. You can see EVERYTHING in the day light. What genius thought this up? Since the bad guys can be seen, they have them ""hiding"" in areas where it doesn't make much sense, like the marshland. They were hiding in the water and just jumped out. I know they are infected with the Las Plagas, but can they BREATHE underwater? Apparently they can. Then absolute worst part and horribly corny is these infected beings (I can't call them zombies since they are really not zombies) will RUSH up to you and attack and then almost come to a stop when they approach you. Oh and they like riding motorcycles too. Speaking of running, you can't reload when you are running. Your character comes to a COMPLETE stop to reload. Ugh, can it get any worse?? Yes, it can. Your partner Sheva's artificial intelligence is okay, but not the best. When she is armed with a gun and she runs out of bullets, for some reason she doesn't switch over to the grenades or other weapons. She will switch from gun to gun, but when she's out of ammo for those, she will go to the knife. You'll also find that she uses ammo like it's going out of style, you are always giving her bullets. I really wanted to like this game, but it's just tired and predictable. I laughed when the ""mystery"" character that saved Irving appeared. Why was he dressed like Batman? Didn't have the ears but it was close. Completely laughable. And they call this survival horror? Please, not a single thing was scary. The game play was boring and not even exciting. No sense of urgency or anything. I felt like I was going through the motions. All of their their previous games gave a sense of fun and excitement. Not this one. We've seen it all before in their other games. It's as if they remade RE 4 and changed a few things. Completely boring. The graphics and sound however is incredible. If you have an audiophile system with an HD TV, it looks and sounds awesome. But you know what they say, all style and substance. That accurately describes this game. Save your money and don't buy this. This is without question the WORST Resident Evil game in the series.","Great graphics, awful game play, feels tired and predictable"

It's so bad that if you have a CD-RW or DVD-RW drive in your computer, the installation of the game will most likely purposely defect itself towhere the game won't run. If you have CD or DVD burning software, or anything even related, or any virtual drives, the same will most likely happen; defective installation. The game's ""Minimum Requirements"" are a lie since they're so low, and you need brand-new, up-to-date drivers for all your hardware. Not only all that, but the game straight out doesn't like some CD/DVD-ROM drives and thus won't install properly, or even at all. Ubisoft support does nothing.
After all this, you'd think they were protecting a really nice game. But, no. The game is riddled with bugs and crashes. Major bugs are commonplace, and the official forum is thriving with hundreds of user requests for bug/crash help. The game also spans 4 CDs (for no apparent reason - the game is very short) that seemingly randomly need to be changed (more copy protection). This leads to scratched discs you can't duplicate, thus you must buy the entire game again.
The game is beautiful and mildly entertaining, albeit short, buggy, and contains terrible voice acting and a horrid saving scheme. That's if you can even get it to install! What a waste of money.

B00503EAG2,1.0,"Well after playing a new reskinned COD4 mappack every year we've finally reached the most awaited game in history and guess what... as a PC game it SUCKS.

- The graphics are outdated as hell.
- Textures are as low quality as they get.
- The UI is GIGANTIC, as in horrid console port.
- The FOV is like 60 and there's no option to change it, as in horrid console port.
- Ranked is limited to that IWNet crap so you LAG, as in horrid console port.
- No console, so yeah no on the fly changes via console commands or anything, you do get an rcon line if you're playing in a dedicated server.
- And get this, to be able to see the server browser you have to actually enable it in the options. I mean I understand that they want people to play using IWNet but seriously they are practicality hiding the server browser.

I haven't played the single player campaign, you really shouldn't but this game for it's campaign since it's like 6 hours long anyways so it's not worth $60, don't kid yourself COD is about the multiplayer.

Anyway, the game is just MW2 with a few really badly designed maps and an outdated engine. Don't buy this game unless you are a really hardcore COD fanboy who only cares about getting his COD fix every year no matter what.

ps: If you REALLY want to play a good Modern Warfare game, then go buy COD4 if you never did, it's still alive and IMO the best in the series.",The most awaited game in history!
B007FMSH4M,1.0,"Look, I've played some mediocre games in my day. And if a game has some redeeming qualities, I'm not above hacking my way through the unpolished parts to get to them. Two Worlds II, for example, was a little rough around the edges. But I enjoyed it nonetheless, and spent upwards of 40 hours fighting my way through to the end.

Risen 2 takes the term ""unpolished"" to a whole new level. To the point where I'm only an hour in, and I'm ready to throw in the towel. Let me count the ways that this game is absolutely atrocious (so far)...

1) The title screen for this game -- which, as near as I can determine, is set sometime around the 1600s -- features an image of a foreboding skull, along with a spinning CD (with a message about autosaving). Excellent art direction so far, fellas. You couldn't have changed that CD icon to something more period-appropriate? A treasure chest perhaps?

2) All of the text in this game -- from the intro sequence to the character names to every bit of text in the menu -- is all in caps for no reason whatsoever. And it's italicized. And I'm pretty sure it's Times New Roman. It's almost as if no one who developed this game knows anything about design, because it's an eyesore.

3) Despite being set in a tropical pirate setting, the graphics are dull and muddy.

4) The voice acting is awful, as though the seemingly-disinterested actors were thinking to themselves the entire time, ""I'm getting paid in cash for this, right?""

5) While locked in a tense duel with some sand crabs or something at the start of the game, the camera inexplicably rotated 180 degrees, so that all I could see was the main character, flailing wildly with his sword. The creatures I was supposed to be fighting were located somewhere out of the frame.

6) The cutscenes not only feature choppy graphics that look like they're from 2002, but also textures that appear and disappear randomly, clunky dialogue and a general sense that whoever ""directed"" these scenes has never actually interacted with another human.

7) I have no idea where I'm supposed to be going, because the map is utterly useless. I managed to figure out how to get out of the outpost by simply talking to everyone, but now that I've hopped a ship and ended up in some other town, I foresee being completely lost at all times.

In my short time with Risen 2, I can confidently say that it's the worst PS3 game I've ever played. I know that making games is not an easy task, but this is just an unfinished mess of a game that never should've been released. Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I'll continue chipping away at it for a bit, just to see if there are any redeeming qualities, and I'll update this review accordingly if this game grows on me at all. But for the time being, this is just an absolute trainwreck.","Good god, this game sucks"

B00CD90R4K,1.0,"Let me get straight to the point, Fifa 14 is by far the worst FIFA game I've played in the last 5 years! Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play. The point is that FIFA 14 is not fun anymore...

What EA has failed to understand is that video games are meant to be fun. when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:

- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players
- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)
- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements
- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)
- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)
- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)
- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!)
_ Throw-ins are just a joke! Players spend most of the time running after the ball themselves as if there's no one out there

Overall, after a game (specially at higher levels) you don't feel like you won the game because you're good. Instead you feel like you only won because you were lucky. That's what kills the fun in a sports game.

After all, it's EA and they sure know how to be the winner of ""Worst Company of the Year"" for 2 years in a row. If you haven't purchased the game yet, don't buy it. It's just a waste of time and money...",They couldn't make a game worse than this even if they tried

B00CA5CGT6,1.0,"I would have given the game itself 3 stars but took 2 away for Uplay which you have to download and install to play the game.

The game itself it OK but tiring.  I'm not easily offended and don't mind well-placed curse words for dramatic effect, but I found the constant profanity immature and objectionable.  I gave up on the game after a couple of missions because of the difficulty saving progress and irritation of Uplay having to load, update, sync, etc.

Uplay is horrid.  After downloading the game, I then had to download/install Uplay.  Then you have to create a Uplay account.  I have a dedicated email account for such things.  Somewhere over the years I must have created an account with Ubisoft, so I had to go to the website, send a reset link to the email address, check the email, reset the password, update the profile.  After all that . . . then came the Uplayer updates.  Two or three initially, and then every 2nd or 3rd time you play the game.  Whew.

I have a SSD as my primary drive and a regular HD for data and non-critical software.  While I was able to set the game to install to the 2nd HD, Uplayer didn't have install options, so it sucked up about a gig on my SSD.

In summary, the game itself is OK except for the saves and the profanity based on your mood/tolerance.  Uplay, however, was a deal breaker for me.  I hope I can remember not to purchase any more Ubisoft titles.","Game so-so, Uplay - not so much."
B003O6EFKI,1.0,"Stages of development for an mmo.

1. Alpha - Making the basic structure of the game
2. Closed Beta - Once the developers see no glaring issues and needs more people for feedback or ideas. Stability and usability issues addressed here.
3. Open Beta - Once the system is fairly stable with multiple people, this stage of for character and class balancing, content addition and planning. This lasts a good while. Open beta people will forgive you if you shut down the server at whim, delete all their characters and test things out that may go haywire.

Stages of development of an MMO Square Enix Style

1. Closed Beta - The game is structured and is massively buggy
2. Open Beta - The game still is massively buggy. Mostly fix client crashes and only deal-breaker usability issues like the mouse lag. Open beta only lasts 3 weeks.
3. Collectors Edition - Still massive glaring usability issues, lag, japanese only servers, server crashes and bugs. Daily notes about server crashes and ""EMERGENCY SERVER MAINTENANCE"" on their lodestone site.
4. PS3 Version 2011 - Everything went better than expected.

B000067FDY,1.0,"I loved this game. When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003. It breaks my heart that I have lost so many friends and a great experience, but this game is truly forsaken. It is not the same game anymore, it is completely different.

B00178630A,1.0,"In most games like Diablo, no amount of gear will allow you to defeat an encounter if you don't know what you are doing. Skill is mandatory, gear is merely helpful.

Diablo 3 is the opposite. Neither are required until you hit Hell difficulty, but after that no amount of skill will allow you to defeat a mob or encounter if you are not geared for it. Gear is mandatory, skill is merely (slightly) helpful.

The overwhelming majority of your deaths are unavoidable. Mobs teleport to you from off the screen and kill you in one shot. They chain you, wall you, spawn under you, jump at you with no warning, surround themselves with invincible minions, and otherwise kill you in ways you absolutely CAN NOT avoid. Unless, of course, you have the necessary gear.

And if you think you can work around this by kiting or taking down mobs slowly and patiently, think again. If you don't kill difficult mobs quickly, you are punished by an unavoidable death (enrage/kill timers). That's right, you are killed for hit/run tactics, kiting, being patient, or otherwise trying to use skill instead of rushing headlong. They aren't exactly subtle with their cues to go buy gear.

So how do you get gear? Not by farming, that's for sure. The chances of getting drops that are useful are exceedingly low, and Blizzard has been quick to remove any farming spots players have found. The only option which doesn't involve months (literally) of farming is the Auction House. You are not going to farm your own gear, you are not going to progress without gear - you have to buy it. And the best items are naturally either on the RMAH or up for ridiculous sums of gold that you have to buy on the RMAH.

This led to another problem, of course: ridiculously-oversimplified skills, runes, mob mechanics etc. This is due to the one-hit mechanics mentioned above. If mobs could be countered with skill or cast spells/abilities which could be avoided with skill, then gear wouldn't be mandatory. Mobs only use gear-check abilities which can *not* be avoided or countered with skill. Naturally, once you have the necessary gear those unavoidable attacks no longer kill you instantly and you can progress so long as you know how to click your mouse.

There is essentially no skill involved in any aspect of the game. There is no reward system, either - you don't get any usable gear or special items or even extra gold for taking down a difficult mob/boss. Instead, you have one big frustration loop. You progress until you run into a brick wall, Blizzard's cue that you need to make purchases on the AH. You die until you get sick of it, go buy gear, and then progress with relative ease until you run into another brick wall.

And since gear-check mechanics are all that you ever see, your skills are all pointless. It really doesn't matter which you use, how well you use them, how you choose to play - none of those things has any real impact on your game. It's all about gear, which means the Auction House.

Like many people, I had assumed the RMAH would simply be a distraction, an optional feature some would make use of and the rest could ignore. That's just not the case. Every aspect of the game is designed to funnel players into the auction house, and the changes made to the game because of that fact completely ruined it. Nearly every complaint about the game can be traced back to the RMAH (even online-only play, as dupes/cheating/hacks/etc. are all just as prevalent - it only serves to promote use of the AH).

They'd already destroyed the WoW franchise. Now they've destroyed the Diablo franchise. Starcraft 2 is all that's which has any hope left for it, though it's currently also riddled with oversimplified mechanics. And since they can't turn that into a cash cow, it's been largely ignored since its release and the expansion is likely still a year away.

Not only do you have to push the right combinations, but it also has to be done in a certain fashion: rhythm and timing must be 100 percent accurate or else you fail and fail over and over again.
Good lord, what a terrible waste of time this game is.

Well obviously it isn't any fun for me, but I can imagine that with a different controller (PS II or XBox) it'll be more comfortable. Still, any game that depends heavily (not to say completely on swift and acrobatic fingerworks suck big time!",I didn't even pass the training section...

B00009ETL0,1.0,"I love Final Fantasy.  I really do.  The World is Square, baby!  (FFI reference).

I wasted a perfectly good giftcard on this puddle of cow vomit because of the fact I saw Square on the cover.  I envision, at Square-Enix headquarters, there is a little room in the basement where the company meets its ""hire the handicapped"" quota.  They spake unto them and said, ""Hark!  I speaketh to thee and bade thee...maketh an RPG!"" and the retards made an RPG and Square saw that it was crap...and that it was bad.  Then Square spoke and said, ""Oh ye of little mental aptitude...I thanketh thee for thine efforts...however, now I must smother thou with a pillow."" and Square smothered the handicapped with a pillow...but not until a few escaped into the battle mechanics room of the Final Fantasy series.

The graphics are vile, the characters two-dimensional, and the combat is something right out of one of those little AA games in the plastic armor hanging on a pegboard shelf in K-Mart.  A rusty Tin Man who's had his joints welded together and eyes riveted shut could move with more fluidity than the sprites in this piece of crap.  Also, the game leaves you with a realization of what a storyline is, since you're so busy LOOKING and WAITING for one to develop within this game.

I viewed this game as a metophorical giant loog wad of yak-spit right in my suck-hole.  Seriously...Square...FOR SHAME!  This game is the equivalent of my PS2 powering on and then nipple-twisting me until I bleed and finishing up with a swift kick to the crotch.

I hate this game more than I hate getting an eyelash stuck in my eyeball...more than when you sit down on a dark leather or vinyl seat in the summer and the nuclear heat sears the skin on the small of your back and back of your knees...I hate this game more than when you go on a water ride at a theme park and your underwear chafe your taint (the area between the crotch and butt).

Seriously, I had a colonoscopy about four years ago and I had to drink this oily lemon-lime stuff that made me squirt clear liquid and wasn't allowed to eat anything for 24 hours so that it felt like my stomach was eating itself and I wanted to die.  Well...this game wasn't quite THAT bad but at least with the colonoscopy I knew it was going to be a horrible experience.  This is a VIDEO GAME.  Dance all happy and free while you put it in the system thinking, ""Another AWESOME RPG from Squaresoft!!!"" and then suddenly you're doing the video game equivalent of gagging down a gallon of Quaker State with lime and squirting clear liquid from your o-ring.

You think I'm kidding?  Do you KNOW where this game disk of mine is right now?  A landfill.  LANDFILL!  Know why?  Because I THREW IT AWAY!  I was moving and consolidating some boxes and THERE IT WAS on the bottom of a box...staring at me.  I looked around...thought about it...and tossed that piece of twice-tossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash.  Did I want the $3 credit from the gamestore?  NOPE!  I refused to subject any other human being, decent or indecent, to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd.  I feel guilty that I didn't snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage shed's power outlet might find this game and try it.

If you love RPGs (especially Final Fantasy) avoid this festering wart on the arsecheek of the Sony Playstation 2.","Well a BIG middle finger to you, too, SQUARE-ENIX"
B0065NP6NC,1.0,"Snooze fest.
I've put in about 6 hours into this and keep waiting for something fun to happen.
The reviews are all very high and the idea of exploring a Vegas wasteland sounded great. Hasn't happened and I guess other RPG's  have spoiled me by grabbing my attention quickly (GTA, Far Cry, Battlefield...).

B000G0OJJ2,1.0,"Of course, usually my expectations are low when I get a game for $10, especially a PS3 game, because there is usually a reason a game is that price.

I'm not making it up when I say I have played SNES racing games (like Mario Kart, for one) that control FAR better than this game does.  It's like every car is a tank and not a car at all.  Graphically, this game is definitely an early gen game.  I've seen some people mention online as a redeeming feature, just do yourself a favor and buy Blur if you want a true online experience (no other racer on the market lets you race 20 to a room).

If you want some blowing up/action with your racing games, then go with Split/Second (which just had DLC released) or Blur.  Don't waste your $10 on this game.","Just stay far, far away from this game..."

B00DE2W5XG,1.0,"System arrived poorly boxed. The top of the box had a lot of air bagging but the bottom and sides had nothing. I know how UPS handles packages and could easily been dropped or throw in shipping. Poor packing on amazon's side.

Package arrived release day at around 5pm est. After opening the packaging, i setup the system and  the system would not boot up. Instead I received a blue pulsing light on the top and nothing else. I then searched the internet to see what was going on. I checked for HDMI issue, but my system was fine in that regards. I also check to make sure HDD was secure and that was fine also. The system just will not boot. I am downloading patch now and will try that. if that fails, I will test the HDD to make sure its functioning. I am also unable to get into safe mode as holding the power button only turns off my system.

I have tried everything from different HDMI cables to different TV's etc. the system was DOA. I have to say i am very angry about all this. I tried calling Sony, but gave up after being on hold for about 2 hours.

If you are thinking of getting a PS4, i would suggest waiting until they get their act together. They have yet to make a real statement nor are they offering good customer service. I hear that most people have to return the unit to Sony and way 4-6 weeks for a new one. Amazon has none either so they only offer a refund (which I may decided to do and get an Xbox one) I would prefer a Sony, but since they are not acting on this and treating it like its no big deal... really gets me mad.",DOA ps4 on day one

Thanks for reading :)",Sad small game
B0050SYILE,1.0,"At first I thought that this might me a decent game, but the more I played it the more I disliked it.  First of all it deserves all the criticism about racism and obscenity.  This game is not for kids, or anyone who is fairly normal psychologically.  If you're into endless cursing, blatant sex acts, and cruelty to animals, then this game is for you.  Now for the game play, if you're still interested.
The game has Auto right in the title.  The cars handle nicely, better than Forza in fact.  The big problem is that this car game can't keep track of your car!  That's right, you do an activity and your car disappears.  You go into a guy's house, come out, and that car is gone.  There is no good way to collect cars, like in Saint's Row.  The map is rudimentary.  You can't bring up the map and move around on it, like in real games.  You get a static map with little blobs that are supposed to be locations of interest.  99% of these locations are clothing stores, barber shops, or gun stores.  The jobs that you're supposed to do show up as ? marks.  You're supposed to know, somehow, if you've done that job or not or if it's' the one you decided not to do.  I guess Rockstar ran out of words.  Speaking of which; you get little hints onscreen every now and then.  If, like me, you don't  have an hdtv you won't be able to read them.  So helpful to see something that might say, ""If you want to something, press the little blob.""  I spent a lot of time online figuring out what these things were about.
You can fly planes, but they are tricky and not a lot of fun, due to having to be super careful not to move the controls too much - more like work.  There are boats, but the one I tried to use to flee the cops didn't work.  It was really fun to run through all those back yards, weaving and dodging, with the idea of using the lake as an escape, only to climb onto a speed boat and discover that Rockstar didn't want that.
The jobs that require using a gun are terrible due to the fact that the targeting mechanism has a tiny dot for aiming - tiny, miniscule, almost invisible.  I've played all the big shooters, both military and sci-fi and this is the worst I've ever seen.  You get a white dot the size of a pin head against a pale building or the sky and it just can't be seen.  The only weapon with a decent sight is the sniper rifle.
The jobs that you're supposed to do aren't too bad for Michael and Franklin, who live in the city.  They are just run of the mill criminals.  Trevor on the other hand, is a psycho, dirty, foul-mouthed, disgusting pig.  You'll want to take a shower after playing as him.  His idea of fun is running over deer or sniping at coyotes - and beating up or killing anyone who looks at him funny.  Where he lives there are very few cars to steal, so you'll spend a lot of time just walking around trying to find one.  Don't run too much; that's not allowed.  Unfortunately you are forced to play as him, the game locking out Michael and Franklin.  I tried driving over to the city to interact with them, but the game won't allow that.  You can drive over, but no jobs are available.  Rockstar Games doesn't believe in free will.  You play what they tell you to play.
If you start a job and don't like it, it isn't easy to get out of it.  You have to abandon the effort by driving 20 miles away, get killed and drop out, or restart the game.  Not very sophisticated.  One job requires you to shoot it out with a gang.  The game kept failing the mission because I wasn't killing them fast enough.  That was because I couldn't get the tiny pinhead dot onto them quickly enough.  Very frustrating.
My biggest problem is that there is no moral choice in the game.  You don't get to chose if you want to be scum. Rockstar demands that you be scum, so even if you ignore the poor mechanics of the game, it's still just a one dimensional, racist, violent, and ultimately boring piece of garbage.  I enjoyed Saint's Row III and would recommend it as an alternative, since its violence is more satyrical.",but the more I played it the more I disliked it. First of all it deserves all the ...
B0092ZEIN4,1.0,"I had the latest Jelly Bean version for Android... I paired it as the manual instructed, the mouse feature worked ok, I downloaded their crappy app which is a Beta by the way, and listed some games that are compatible with HID features such as Dead Trigger 2.

B001ABN82A,1.0,"As a previous reviewer noted, drums do not work.

I'm also having problems with the red drum pad, but it's slightly different.  Some hits register on the red and some don't.  Whether I hit them hard, soft, or somewhere in between there's no telling whether or not the hit is going to register.

On top of that my yellow cymbal doesn't work ... at all.  Out of the box I kept failing the very first song in career mode and I just assumed my unfamiliarity with the game was the cause.  Nope.  Payed attention on the 3rd run and realised my yellow cymbal wasn't working.  Checked the connection and it was seated tightly, same result.  Eventually I went into the song creator so I could mess with the cymbal nonstop without failing out.  After adjusting the wire from drums to cymbal I managed to get hits registering pretty well.  I wrapped the wire around the cymbal mount ONCE, then plugged it in.  Still after a few hits sensitivity would drop and hits would fail to register at all.  It seems like there is a wiring issue, a short perhaps, in the cymbal connection.  Moving the wire around in different positions would occasionally register hits, but I couldn't find a position that worked 100% of the time.  Returned it.

Bottom line-
If you want to play drums, just buy the game now and wait for a better revision to be released.  The current set is way too buggy, then again you might get lucky and get a working set.  I just hope that a few months down the line, once your warranty has expired, that your set is still working.  Otherwise you'll be out of luck.

B000X2BAPY,1.0,"To answer the first question on everyone's mind, yes.  This newly redesigned PSP 2000 case WILL fit your PSP game console even if you have the 2200mAh battery with extended back-plate.  There is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the PSP 2000 to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery cover.

Now the explanation for the one star rating:

The case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the PSP system itself.  It has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate, floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loose.

Also, unlike other PSP cases I've owned, the PSP logo isn't etched or inscribed onto the case lid, even though it looks that way in pictures.  The PSP trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shell.

This case also comes complete with small rubber grips that, when opened properly, can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the PSP in your hands.  Only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on.  It will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table, the counter, the desk...etc..

This case looks, feels and performs more like a $5.00 cheapo instead of a $20.00 quality product.  For this price I would find something better (and you can...very easily) instead of settling for this lesser product.",CHEAPLY REDESIGNED FOR THE PSP 2000

...............................
+ Visuals are fine. It's obviously the thing they put most of the money into for this game.
+ Lots of character variety. All the anime tropes are here.
...............................
- The combat is just plain garbage. It's the stickiest, juttery Dynasty Warriors-esque combat I've ever played in my life. Imagine doing a dash along the ground. Now imagine a slight hiccup at the start of the dash. Just imagine tripping constantly through a dash. Then pretend you're trying to look to your right but the sensitivity's turned down to almost minimum. That's what this game feels like. Combos are exactly what you think they'd be: two or three light attacks then a strong for a combo. Now do that in the air. Congratulations you've mastered the roster.

- The dialogue is just nothing. I'm amazed to be honest. It's the fluff to end all fluff of hot girls talking to other hot girls with the anime trope conversations. You could easily switch dialogue between any character in a scene or, heck, swap dialogue across scenes. It'd all be the same. It's basically nothing dialogue for 10 minutes in between each mission.

B000VL4J9Q,1.0,"In short, Aion is a pretty game that's light on content and revolves around grinding.

(-) Pedestrian content that's non-interactive. There are only brief cut scenes that place the player in a passive role. There's almost no context-sensitive, scripted, or interactive events of any kind. Just kill, collect, or deliver.

(-) A glaring lack of content, especially quests and PvP. For PvP, there's only the most basic, familiar trappings from pre-2003 MMOs: open world only - no organized or instanced PvP, no rated team play, et cetera. For PvE/quests, the content is so thin and unrewarding (in regards to experience and currency earned for completion) that you'll be grinding very early on

(-) Time and money sinks are ubiquitous and detract from immersion: chance of failure on gathering/crafting/gear enhancement (which are all expensive), experience loss upon death along with substantial fees to reclaim it, expensive forms of rapid transit, severe limitations on storage and trade, etc, etc, etc

(-) The communication/chat system and user interface feel like they were birthed in 2001

(-) Real money traders (people that sell in-game, virtual currency for real money) are everywhere - flooding the chat channels endlessly with their announcements, sending you mails, and even sitting out in the open world for days with loud advertisements above their head. The tools provided by the user to ignore or filter them are amateur, barely useful, and place a burden upon the user. Their automated characters (""bots"", clients controlled by programs that script/automate the functions of a human being) litter the landscape, you're forced to directly compete with them for resources (quest mobs, hell any mobs, crafting materials, etc). This all bleeds into the economy of the game, since they have endless resources and drive up the in-game costs of items on the auction house. Since the punitive, grinding nature of the game encourages all of this, and NCSoft (developer) apparently has no intentions of stopping it, it continues to escalate daily. When I last logged off, there were far more bots than actual players - as far as I could tell.

The only people that will tolerate this game are the people that have never played any of the next gen titles before it. If it sounds like I'm yelling and a little teary eyed thats because I truly am. This is my favorite series of all time and to see it turn into this pile of garbage is just depressing. First Madden turns into a child's arcade game and now Ninja Gaiden has turned into a soulless neutered waist of time and money. I will be writing, emailing, calling or whatever I have to do to get in contact with Team not so Ninja and tell them exactly what I think of this awful awful game. . Sorry for making this review so personal but I had to get it off my chest before I went crazy from disappointment. Please do not waist your money on this game. You would have more fun playing dodge ball with a porcupine than playing this slow monstrosity of a game.",Soul crushing sadness..

B000NKRIZW,1.0,"I am a big fan of adventure games in general, and got this game on vacation this summer. I had only played it a few minutes when there was a d**n and h**l. I expected this. In my mind that is ""mild"" language, however, that is not the extent of the severity of the language. Immediately following these words was a G-d**n. I really hate to spell it out, but I am a Christian and this type of language really offends me. I quit playing at this point, so I don't know how much more language there was (but judging by other reviews that I read elsewhere, there was quite a bit more of the same type). Other than the language this game looked very promising. The graphics were really nice, and the voice acting was good (just not what they were saying!). Just to be fair to the company, when I complained to them, they were really great about it and willingly replaced my game for a more appropriate fit.
As a note: I would just like to say that I know that my opinion here will not be popular with some people, but I stand by it just the same. Thanks for reading! I hope this review was helpful.","""Mild"" Language?"
B00009ZVHV,1.0,"There are somethings I'll never understand. Basic Geometry, how Michael Bolton became successful.....and how a great and iconic character like Batman can never have a decent video game. The first Batgame for Playstation 2, Vengence, had it's moments. Though it wasn't ""great"" it at least felt like a Batman game. Batman Dark Tomorrow was an outright disaster. And now it looks like Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu continues the downward slide for the Dark Knight.
Rise of Sin Tzu's biggest downfall is it's gameplay. Where as Vengence attempted to be more of an adventure oriented game, Rise of Sin Tzu takes an entirely different approach. It's pretty much a straight forward beat 'em up game. But unfortunatley it doesn't know how to keep you interested in it to make you keep wanting to play. The game descends into punching and kicking your way past various non-descript bad guys and the occassional gas bomb lobbed in to the fray by the villain the Scarecrow. Two players can play in a co-operative mode simultaneously but it does little to change the gameplay. The game is interesting for about ten minutes then boredom quickley sets in. After the first few levels I could see that there was pretty much nothing else this game had to offer.
The graphics on this game are decent. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing all move with convincing ease and fluidity. But the environments are rather plain and sterile. They look like they could be just about any street anywhere. There was nothing to indicate that this was Gotham City. It could have been Cleveland for I knew. The sound was also very generic. Sure Batman and company uttered some pretty good ""one liners"", but it got old fast.
The controls are very easy to manage. They are however wasted on a game like this. The time it will take you to become accustomed to the controls is maybe about five to ten minutes.
This game managed to let me down on just about every level. I'm not even sure if a hardcore Batfan would even enjoy it. Ubi Soft has shamelessly squandered the potential for this licence. At this point the only thing that I think would inject new life into the franchise is if the game license changed hands and went to a company like Activision, Electronic Arts, Eidos or anyone else. If you can track down a copy of Batman: Vengence, you would be better served playing that. Though not perfect it's the better of the two Batman games.",Terrible!! A huge let down.

I updated the drivers from my Geforce Nvidia 8800 video card in my Dell XPS junk and now all is somewhat stable.  The game itself is wonderful but a little pain to get going with the Games for windows live application.  Amazing graphics like Oblivion, great quests, lots of open world areas to explore, amazing atomsphere and landscape for post apoc.  Another great idea by Bethesda.  They went a step further with the gore, and the slow motion vs shots are to die for literally.  As I stated the game itself is good but it's a very broken, mess of a game.  There are so many script, graphics, and sound problems with this game that makes it virtually unplayable.

Thats jes what this game is: Jes' like a newspaper the front page doesn't last long, jes like the main part of the game, story mode, Only lasted 1 day, and I knew the rest of the game would liably be garbage.  Then like a newspaper, u try to see if anything else is good.  All the modes [stink], and git old too fast, jes like other sections of the newspaper, u don't even wanna read.
I was gonna throw it away like garbage, until my borther wanted tha game.  I was gonna give it to him, cuz I put a nasty scratch, that's why I was gonna throuw it away, cuz I couldn't return it wit' a nasty scratch.  But my brother gave me deal that was too good to refuse.  He traded me Max Payen for a game worth no more than a newspaper.  I didn't say a damn thang after that.  He told me the game was great, but dead on arrival was too hard; and it was a early birthday gift.  I agreed with him, but I'd rather accept a challange, than playing a game, that's like a DVD look at todays news, that u control.
The game lacks a good storyline, good missions, graphics(look like Tekken 1 graphics, I mean [come] on it's the PS2 4 cryin' out loud)It also lacks, Alot of ammo, voices, good gangs, good multiple modes, and good guns.
The hype is pure garbage, and all this good things reviews said about it makes u wanna buy it, but when u play it u'll realize it's a 100% rip off, cuz u'll realize, it's jes like a newspaper, good at first but garbage the next second.

B00006BMQB,1.0,I thought I was getting a PC game? the description did not say it was for playstation 2?  I don't have a PLAYSTATION 2 or othwise.,wrong type
B00001OWYW,1.0,"It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it ""best game of all-time"" or ""best Castlevania game you'll ever play"".
I don't think so.  If you want a ""real"" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.
Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.
After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.
Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!
But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.
Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.
Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.
You're probably thinking by now ""Alright, talk about the actual GAME!""  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.
Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.",Konami never should have made this game

B0015HZLUQ,1.0,"this has got to be one of the worst wii games i ever played, even worse than trauma center. where do i start?
for one its hard to control despite how simple the controls are, some of the challenges in the beginning of the game are nearly impossible to beat and the rating system. i thought it would be fair if the performance rating would average each rating such as turning and speed together, but no thats not the case, it takes the lowest grade and makes it the final grade, so if i got an A grade in everything and a D in turning, my overall grade would be a d. another thing, you are rated on how much you turn, which makes no sense because theres no reason to turn excessively  on courses where you are going straight down, or courses that require little turning, you should only turn as much as you need to. i have had it with this game.
how is this game so easy yet so hard, well when one of the training courses kept failing me cause i did not turn enough despite me turning the entire time. it was relatively easy to control cause i was getting used to the balance board, but it was failing me even though i did it right.

it is not all bad, i kind of like how when im playing the game at night time i have the option to choose to play the game in the night time setting, but thats not saying much.

i am usually the one not to complain about video game graphics, but these are just so bad, in some cases the graphics can get worse than the n64, like when people talk.

another problem i have with this game is the lack of wii remote usages, all you to is push down to speed up and wiggle your arms in mid air do do a random airborne trick. i was not expecting much out of we ski, but i did not know it would be this horrible.",so easy and childish game yet impossible to play

The client was offered on their website, so I downloaded it, created my account, and proceeded to launch the game. When the launcher activated, I was given a rather ambiguous message, so I proceeded to call customer support. I was told that I had purchased a subscription to the game, but I did not have a ""retail key"", which is provided in a separate package that costs $20 more.
Given my past experience with MMORPG's, especially City of Heroes/Villains, Cryptic Studios' last product, this was unexpected, and rather disappointing for a game I have been waiting for for nearly a year.

B00CMQTUCE,1.0,"I am really disappointed in this game. I wish Microsoft would refund everyone for whatever this attempt of a game was. For paying over $60 for a game that digresses rather than improves on the 360 version is a let down.

The only two games that seem to work well are tennis and bowling...which are the two simplest games that are on my Wii Sports already. And even with tennis, my friends and I will spend several minutes just getting our avatar to serve the ball.

The target shooting and soccer are very lame. For target shooting, you stand and move your hand around the screen just over the targets. It takes no skill and is pointless. The soccer game doesn't read where you kick the ball and the shots are just terrible. We would turn to aim our shots and passes--they all end up in the same spot no matter what. It's like watching a really bad simulated game of virtual foosball.

So in conclusion, I want to help other people from making the same mistake I did of buying this game. It is not fun and not worth your money. Maybe rent it sometime if you want to give it try, but DON'T buy it. You will regret wasting your money. If you are looking to get a game that takes advantage of the new kinect, this is not it.

Here is what you are ""getting"" with Steam:

- No returns. No resale value. This is in violation of the US First Sale doctrine, as your game is suddenly not ""yours"" anymore. The disc becomes a coaster and you might as well trash it.

- Online activation: You must have Steam running to play the game. You must associate this game with a Steam account. You must be connected to the internet to play the game. And you know the game will stop to function when Steam as a service ceases to exists (making this purchase effectively a rental).

- The game will be locked to the initial Steam account. If you friend or family member wants to borrow the game, they will need your login credentials.

- Lack of standalone patches. This is a major incovenience as Steam will try to install the latest patch version even if it's problematic or broken. It is also impossible to backup these patches, requiring you to download them each time.

B000EPP6UA,1.0,"This is frankly the worst game I have ever played.  Anyone who gives this higher than 2 stars has either: a)never played the pc version, b)played with a USB game controller, or c)only played the console versions (PS2, Gamecube, etc.).

This is a classic example of a console game that was ported by a low-budget Japanese company to the PC in order to bring in more dollars.  There is absolutely no mouse support outside of a 3rd party mouse-hack, which only makes aiming slightly better.  When gamers like myself have to turn to other gamers to make the controls better, it is a pathetic game to start with.

The ""minimum system requirements"" are far to low to even come close to playing the game in the lowest detail/resolution.  Even their recommended system requirements might not be able to play the game in full detail.

The graphics are good but there is no ""wow-effect"" when it comes to textures during normal gameplay.  The cutscenes are poor 640x480 resolution with no lighting effects whatsoever and short vertical white lines randomly in the picture.  Think of a cutscene from a late 90s game to get the idea.

Here comes the worst part of it: the control conversion.  Rather than saying ""Press Shift to dodge this boulder that will kill you"", the game uses the console text: ""Press the 3rd button"".  It took me 10 tries to figure out what ""1 + 3"" was on the keyboard.  To me it would seem easy to re-write the game code to say ""Shift + Enter"" instead of ""1 + 3"".  After 3 months of release delays, I expect much better.

In conclusion, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  ""Obscure"" for $6 is far superior in graphics and gameplay (2 people can play).  This game would be great on the PS2, but this shoddy PC version has really left a foul taste in my mouth.  As of writing this review I have still not finished the game due to sheer frustration with the controls.",HORRID PC Port!
B0050SYZS0,1.0,"After Bioware's showings on Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age 2, it was quite clear that the EA board room was going to have more control over their games than their development team. Thus you end up with a rushed product. I'm sure the Mass Effect team did their best to reconcile what they felt needed to be done with the demands set upon them. It is not their efforts I critique, but their inability to fight for their own work. You can have a worthy conclusion to the saga or a two year development period, not both. So they saved some money on a short development and they loose a third of their fan base. I urge everyone not to buy this or at the very least wait until it's a value title. I will be selling my copy in order to take another $60 from Bioware/EA. I will not buy any DLC from them ever again and I will never purchase another game from them.

B00024ALF8,1.0,"Tron 2.0

It really is sad when developers have such a good idea for a game but the end product falls short of fun and entertaining. I'm sure the fan boys out there are going to chew up my review for this but first, I don't think the movie Tron even made much of an impact at the box office. I think I first saw it in '92. I recently saw the game on the shelves and decided to give it a try.

The graphics of Killer App look  really good. Granted the levels each consist of one color  in a few different shades. None the less animation is smooth and I never incurred choppy graphics. Design of the levels, characters, weapons and light cycle all feel authentic. The sound is also well done especially with surround sound, but the bass was over done.

The game play was a poor experience. First of all the guns are horribly inaccurate do almost no damage except the sniper rifle. Unloading on your enemies quickly drains your energy level leaving you vulnerable and with only your disc as protection. Health also drains pretty fast. I am a huge fan of first person shooters and Killer App simply felt more like a platform adventure in a shooter engine. The enemies can be at the end of a vast stadium or expansive hallway and can hit you with bullseye accuracy from the first shot they fire. Thats fine, games are more fun when they're more challenging. However, most of the levels, you have to pay extremely close attention to your steps since you can easily fall off a catwalk to your doom; that takes away the tactical use of strafing and its just poor planning. The shooting part of the game makes for a frustrating experience since you WILL be swarmed by enemies with perfect accuracy and you have to juggle your attention between your energy bar, your aiming and your footing plus for the most part tracking down an objective you have no idea where to find and lastly the enemies that are respawning-think Halo legendary difficulty, with almost no ammo and no friends to help you.

Now I'm sure any huge computer dork would love the ability management system in the game. Not only is it poorly explained but its also another factor that holds back any fun in the game, as you have to aquire abilities and power them up. Why should that be so bad? because leveling up abilities DRAINS YOUR ENERGY BAR  leaving you with even less precious ammo to use against the waves of deadeye drones trying to air you out. I won't even go into the plot as it doesn't matter.

I suppose the only thing I actually enjoyed in the game was the light cycles. Before you get all excited, there is very limited use of the cycles in the game, in fact almost none. In all Tron 2.0 Killer App is a graphically noble attempt at the FPS genre. The short comings far outweigh its attempt. Heres a quick summary of the experience:

read boring vague menu, more vague menu, kill 5 drones, miss a step and fall to death, retry---and it just loops over and over like that. Of course if you're a huge fan of the movie and enjoy platform games and enjoy ""reading"" a video game rather than playing it, look for Tron 2.0 in your local game store's bargain bin.

And one last note to the fan boys that love this game, I read an article recently that says the director of ""The Princess Diares"" will be releasing a new Tron movie-so look for a mediocre movie to go along with the bland game.",Interesting  level designs

As soon as you get one up, most of the others fall down. I also miss the build mode.

B001QIRSA0,1.0,"I want to start off by saying that I am not a hardcore Superbike fan.  I thought this game would offer gameplay similiar to Forza...just for motorcycles.  I expected to be able to adjust the bike (beyond just colors etc, but be able to adjust suspension, tire pressure etc) and you can.  I expected that many tracks would be available...and there is.  I expected decent graphics...and they actually are sub-par.  What I did not expect are incessant load screens, which there are.  I did not expect the handling to be so freaking touchy..downright frustrating, and they are.  This game might be fun after 5-6 hours of practicing controls, but I do not have anywhere near that amount of patience.

Mind you I am far from a casual gamer, I am quite proficient and can play all genres.  This game, after playing over an hour I did not win one single race.  I was not close to winning one single race.

B0050SYDEQ,1.0,"Forza Horizon is nothing like Forza 4, it is an arcade game where you drive cars. The Horizon game itself is fun; driving around racing AI drivers, racing challenges and ""street races"" for credits and cars. Even for a novice, you reach the limits of the game quickly. The game map is not very big and becomes repetitive pretty fast. No real tuning of cars. You buy cars in download packs, then you have to ""win"" the cars you bought with game credits. No Free Play like in Forza 4. Multiplayer, well, hard to tell what's going on there. Lag, cheating or both make racing against cars that are flying, traveling underground or moving at warp speed make it virtually unplayable. And then there's people who play just to crash you out of the race.
They just came out with the ""Rally Expansion Pack"". Sounds like fun, but is really boring. You must finish all stages of a particular race in one sitting or you have to go back and start from the beginning. Either do what the Forza Horizon game commands you to do or be sentenced to boring replays. They should call it ""Groundhog Day Forza"".
The Forza Motorsports servers are down for me about 50% of the time or more, which means you can't win points or credits, receive messages or race online.

B000SH3XG8,1.0,"Originally I was thinking as I played this, and read pre-hand reviews, ""Wii users get screwed over"", and after playing the Xbox360 version, I can definitely confirm this.

With each vast step forward the WWE seems to take with regards to its new games, they always manage to slip up when entering the realm of next gen consoles and totally fumble, but this time it's inexcusable. Match types are quite literally only Singles, Hardcore, Triple Threat, Tag, and Last Man Standing match. And to think you had table matches, ladder matches, Cage matches, TLC matches, and Hell in a Cell matches in Day of Reckoning 2 (Nintendo version's predecessor in 2005).

The roster is quite large, but still sparse in a way as it misses out on some of the promising young talent, and instead keeps several superstars long gone from the company, including Sabu, Sandman, Chris Masters (forgiveable since he was just released a week or two ago), JTG and Shad Gaspard (Who? Cryme Tyme. Oh yeah, the racist joke Steph found funny), and King Booker T.

Conspicuously missing from the roster are the likes of Brian Kendrick and Paul London, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, Hornswoggle, Deuce and Domino, Viscera (Big Daddy V), Matt Striker, Balls Mahoney, Kevin Thorn, The Miz (thank god), Hardcore Holly, Little Guido (Nunzio), etc.

The Create a Wrestler mode is unchanged, thankfully, with a wide variety of options to recreate much of your Day of Reckoning and Day of Reckoning 2 CAS's over again, with better graphics. Female wrestlers will have to be humiliated by having a separate mode (though identical) called ""Create a Diva"" mode.

Storyline mode in the game is called ""Main Event"" and consists primarily of you joining either Raw or Smackdown (because apparently ECW isn't worth joining) and receiving random challenges via text messaging (no joke. Umaga's message to you: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! And subtitled: I will beat you to death with your own arms. One hell of a language, that Samoan. Full of subtlty). You start out weak, no matter what superstar you choose, and have to spend points training, and recieving ""massages"" to relieve fatigue. You have to do this after EVERY match because otherwise you start new matches with the same fatigue level you had last week (because in the crazy world of the WWE, weeks pass like seconds).

God help anyone wishing to make themselves a finely crafted wrestler with only the best moves available, or a skilled high flying/technician. In true WWE fashion as with John Cena and The Great Khali, you only have around 5 chooseable moves. The rest are preset based on what wrestling style you choose your superstar as. There is no way to choose the moves you do regarding punches, kicks, etc. And the move-list available is flimsier and shorter than Wrestlemania X8's. The only good aerial attacks being a moonsault, and TWO versions of the Swanton bomb, both equally sloppy and capable of breaking your neck if the game didn't turn at the last moment.

Not that you'd really need to pick your moves much. In the ring, most all of the action revolves around the same system as WWF Warzone and WWF Attitude, only shortened considerably: beat your opponent down till their health bar goes down into the red. Once it's in the red, you can do your finisher as many times as you want. Whereas Warzone and Attitude had several layers of health bars to beat through, this one only has half of one, meaning a match can literally be over in two minutes or less with enough punching, and three or four finishing moves in a row. The WWE must have been so ashamed of this, they removed the timer showing how much time there is in the match---you'll be counting your matches by milliseconds.

Typical problems already complained about, including no running. The controller is actually quite fun, but even the game totally fumbles that mess. The only way to punch and kick and dropkick etc is to swing your remote around, and the only way to counter a move is to do the EXACT SAME MOVE as your opponent at the EXACT SAME TIME AS THEM! (this is easier than it sounds, as the only real moves are done the exact same way: hold A and B and swing in some direction), so repeatedly hitting R will do nothing for you. Minor moves are also done by swinging repeatedly in some way. The manual doesn't bother to detail this for you, and the game's on-screen instructions can be vague, or simply not there. For example, there is seemingly no way to release an opponent when preparing them for a Death Valley Driver-like maneuver. Swinging in any direction will only make your character spin like a retarded Top.

I think that about covers this latest WWE abortion. The same sort of watered down action you get on WWE TV these days, dense and unexplained controls, almost impossible reversal system, dirt-poor storymode, inability to run, and most damning of all, a health-bar system of combat, which renders everything but the most damaging moves and a finishing move obsolete. Why bother trying to irish whip an opponent or use a high flying move when you can just punch the crap out of them till they go red, then do nine or ten finishers in a row on them for a pin? The average match length so far for me has been about a minute and a half. If I manage to work the AI into having a semi-decent match, this can stretch as far along as 5 minutes or slightly more.

Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.

There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.

B004L491A6,1.0,"This is the worst version of this game available. Well, in fairness, the DS game is probably clunkier, but it does CT the service of not even trying to be the original game. It was its own thing and while I would maintain that the choice to make a full 3D stealth game on a platform as weak as the DS was ill-advised, it's pretty OK for what it is. It doesn't bother me overmuch. I still think they could have made something far better if they adapted it for 2 dimensions, but never mind that.

This abomination, on the other hand, is all of the recognizable elements of Chaos Theory cut up and watered down for the 3DS. As you might have guessed, this really pisses me off. The levels, including the perfectly placed lighthouse opener, have been cut into shorter, simpler sections separated by load zones. Every single texture has been reduced to an indistinguishable smear of its former self. The only thing they couldn't really ruin in the transition was the animations.

The lighting, the SINGLE most important visual element of Splinter Cell, has been completely ruined. The gorgeous, deep black dynamic lighting of the original is now a relatively uniform blanket of uninteresting dimness. Night vision is now what appears to be a blurry white texture applied to enemies. It is completely useless. The only real indicator of concealment is the light meter.

And then there are the controls... Unlike the DS game, which had the decency to employ the less-than-perfect, but reasonably precise touch screen for aiming, now we have the FACE BUTTONS. On top of this, they have replaced the aiming reticle with a much larger and much less useful variation that actually gets in the way. It gets in the way because it immediately becomes massive and red when you are pointing at an enemy. It becomes large enough that it becomes difficult to line up a reliable head shot at even pretty reasonable distances. Awful.

They even remixed the incredible soundtrack by Amon Tobin and, like all of the other modifications, made it worse as result (though perhaps by a lesser margin than the previous elements).

In short: avoid this game like the plague. If you haven't played Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, pick it up for the Original Xbox, PC, or PS3 (listed in order of quality). If you have played it, don't tarnish your memories of that classic by subjecting yourself to this mess. It isn't worth the time or the money. I really wish it was.",Play the real Chaos Theory and save yourself the pain of this butchered handheld version.

In hind sight, the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think I would have thrown it back at them.
AI is hard to get right in any game, but this game set a new standard in REALLY STUPID AI. While in camp mode, your supposed to walk around, conduct tasks, talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances. It never mattered what you did in camp, it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the game.

If you want to play single player you are forced to put up with the most retarded AI players you have ever witnessed in your entire life.  The AI doesn't defend worth a sh%t, and all they ever do, the AI supposedly on your team, is get directly between u and the goal you are trying to make.  Or they clear the ball from the opponents goal when you just killed yourself trying to get it centered for a goal attempt.
If you want to play online multiplayer then you suffer from many of the worst human beings who ever occupied this planet, true scum, trolls from hell.  And then the worst part.  People who have been playing for years play at the same levels as new or inexperienced players which results in teams always, always being unfair.  You never get to play an honest game to test you fairly for your skills.  Sure sometimes you will win and some you will lose.  The irritation is that you spend hundreds even thousands of hours getting good at controlling your car and learning the ropes just to never play fairly matched players in the game.  And the makers of this game want it that way.  Because if they made it truly fair then their old, cheating players would leave, and that would cause the makers lose money off of sales, selling tires, paint jobs, etc...
Do yourself a favor and do not buy.  It pulls you into an endless hell-of-frustration for absolutely NO long term benefit.
Could be a great game if the makers were not greedy allowing so much cheating.  But hey if you don't mind being cheated then I guess it would be fun, not rewarding long term.  But it does cause the release of strings of endorphins, short term, momentary tiny-highs.

B00GXHIL28,1.0,"One of the few games I've ever purchased that I just couldn't finish.  And I gave this at least a few days worth of effort before giving up.  I think one of the biggest annoyances was the lack of variation in enemies.  It seemed to take forever to reach a new type of enemy, and then they'd just be some small variation on everyone I was already fighting.  A little bit faster, a little more health.

I never felt driven by the story.  In fact, now that it's been a year or so, I don't even remember what it was anymore.  But I remember at the time, just not caring that much.  I could possess rats, though...and that's about all that really stood out as cool to me.

Another annoying part for me is that you never speak in the game.  Everyone else does, but you're totally silent, which makes you feel like you're more watching than playing the game.  But then again, that was brilliantly pulled off in Half Life.  In any event, it stood out to me, and the game environment just feels tortuously sterile, partly because of that.","Good looking game and interesting concept, but overall sterile and repetitive."

B000RA5BMK,1.0,"I bought this months before the holdays as a gift put it on a shelf and forgot about it. Oops! Installed it in January for my wife, Yay! (I thought)

 The Interface is the Jeopardy set with more than two thirds of the screen devoted to the player lecterns This left a very small part of the screen for question categories. The main board text is small fuzzy and nearly unreadable even with the highest quality settings.

 Game play is similar to earlier versions. Except that now it is multiple choice. My wife loves this, everything can be selected quickly with the mouse. It would of been better as an option i think. If you play the computer opponents the count down timers, video animations and audience applause sounds slow the pace.

 Award trophies are given for game milestones: Points earned, Hours played, Catagories swept, Number of games played, Etc. There are dozens of them.

 You can customise your avatars appearance or quickly skip through and begin playing. nice.

Pros:
 Mutliple choice questions.
 It will play on nearly any Windows XP PC fast or slow. I'll leave someone else to try it with Linux and WINE.
 There are plenty of categories and questions four hours of play abd there weren't any catagories repeated.
 You won't need to carry the install CD with you to run it. Perfect for travel or waiting for a class.

Cons:
 Multiple choice questions aren't optional.
 The main category board doesn't read clearly.
 The pace is somewhat slower than earlier versions due to animations and sound effects with multiple computer opponents.

 Jeopardy deluxe is an improvement in some ways over earlier versions. My wife loves it. (shrug)",Looks like the show but plays slightly different.

Could only play a few hours a week before having to shut it off out of dislike andcannot bring myself to finish this. I got through Dragon Age II which was a let down but nothing compared to this failure.

I had read somewhere years ago that Mass Effect was going to be a trilogy. Created by the great minds at Bioware who are long gone now. What we have left is EA seeing an opportunity to capitalize on a title and a group of not so skilled writers trying to fill some big shoes. If this was a title that did not have the Mass Effect label it would be fairly decent....not great.

I agree with the previous reviews stating it's faults. The seriousness of the Mass Effect universe is gone replaced by what feels like high school students with cheesy one liners experimenting with their sexuality. I was almost embarrassed by some of the sophmoric  dialogue. The humor attempts were not even funny.

First of all it's buggy as all get out.  I've been walking through the frontier and got stuck on a rock that I walked over and had to completely restart the game to get out of it multiple times.  The biggest problem for me is that change to the combat system.  The geared it towards the hardcore player not to the causal gamer, if there's more than 2 opponents you may as well just start running, you have essentially 0% chance of beating them especially since they can all attack you at once and if one of the animals in the forest attacks just lay down and die because there's very little chance that that quick time event combat for animals will ever allow you to live.

I had only owned it for almost 3 months, and it worked fine at first. However, one of the re-chargable battery packs that came with it did not work, and the other worked fine...for a while anyway.
I was playing a game with my wii remote, it was fully charged, maybe 10 minutes off the charger. Then, the remote connection failed as I was playing, and when I checked the remote battery life, it was completely dead. I then tried putting in different batteries for the remote, regular Energizer ones (brand new) and the remote lights flashed and went out, indicating that the remote was now inoperable.
Basically what im saying is, this charger killed my Wii remote. The only one I had. I got this charger so I wouldnt have to buy batteries anymore, but as it turned out, it cost me way more than it was worth. I will have to buy a new Wii remote now, so this makes me very sad.
I have it stored back in its box, and its only for display, since the Sonic figure is really cool. Thats about all its good for. If you buy this and have problems with it, don't say I didn't warn you. Mad Katz is the manufacturer of this product, and I tried contacting them on the matter, and they were no help at all.

Also, the way the save points are set up, if you get stuck and keep dying on a certain part and want to back up and try it again, you have to do the exact same scene over and over and over again until you figure it out. It's so boring that it makes the game almost unplayable to me.

My copy is electronic, and is listed in my online games library with EA Origin.  I recently upgraded my computer (new hard drives, etc.), and foolishly thought I could simply re-install TW PGA Tour 07.

Having run out of ideas, I connected to EA Support via online chat.  After about 20 minutes chatting with support personnel and supervisors, the conclusion they reached was that because EA has permanently shut down the server for TW 07, I would never again be able to verify the game, which means it will not play.  As a consolation, they gave me a code to get 15% off of my next purchase from EA Origin.

They forced their DRM upon me, and then removed my only venue for verifying (yet again) the fact that they (long ago) received my cash.  Frustrating that the game shows up in my ""official"" library, though I can't play it.  Another disappointing move by EA, because I believe TW 07 to be the best of the series.","EA Shut down server, can no longer ""verify"" (or play)"
B000FKBCX4,1.0,"When I first heard about SPORE, I got really excited. I have been a fan of many of the similar games produced by Maxis such as Sim Earth and Sim Life and thought that SPORE might be the next iteration in the process. After making triply sure I could play the game on my old MacBook Pro, I placed my preorder. It was only when the game arrived that I discovered that an internet connection is required to be able to play the game - I had spent 3 months researching the game and this was not mentioned anywhere! And the computer on which I planned to play the game cannot be connected to the Internet (faulty modem which I do not intend to replace). Thus, I returned the game completely unopened to Amazon.com (that part at least was painless).
What upsets me about all this is that I was personally looking foreward to a game where I could essentially muck about with fun creature designs, the game be damned. I wanted to make critters! To my dismay, even the Creature Creator software is Internet-dependent. And from the recent reviews I've been reading, EA is acting like Serious Cybernetics and telling people with legitimate issues to ""go stick your head in a pig"" (quote from ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" original radio play).
This just reminds me of the fact that EA is such a nasty company. They have never had good customer relations and their complaints department is nonexistent as far as I have heard from disappointed friends who had issues with their sports games. Someone working in my local video gaming specialty store has told me that they get more complaints and returns related to EA games than any other company. One wonders how they can stay in business. Personally, I will never buy another EA product if I can help it! If you're smart, you won't either.

Update 7/14/2013: I realized that I have not made a distinction between EA and MAXIS. MAXIS games are almost always good ideas and have something to recommend them, even if the execution is a bit flawed. The problem is that they have got themselves in bed with EA Games for the purposes of distribution and that always seems to kill whatever good they try to do. I really would like to play SPORE someday, but that seems like a pipe dream now.",What A Disappointment!

B001AYEGXM,1.0,"Like Mass Effect from EA before it (and unfortunately a number of other recent titles), EA has infected this with ""Activation"" DRM. They get your money, but you don't own a copy. You can only install/reinstall it if you have an internet connection, their server is running (it won't be forever), and you haven't installed it twice before (which you could end up doing just deciding what system to run it on).

B00166N6SA,1.0,"Wow EA really jacked this one up. Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made. Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers, there was so much right about the game (ease of use, the fun of designing and building custom houses, the excellent expansion packs, the fantastic user made content, etc.) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2. However, I AT LEAST expected it to be playable, and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun. To sum up the rest of this review: It's nowhere close. It stinks. It's unplayable due to crashes (for me at least). It's a buggy, unfun, massive step backwards from Sims 2.

So what makes it so bad?

First off, the game crashes nearly constantly. It is not my computer. I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market. (For the nerds, I have a i7 processor, 6gb ram, and crossfired ATI HD4870s). These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing. This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability.

They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact, make friends and enemies, get married to each other, etc... You are now forced to play a single family at a time. Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs (non player controlled) characters. You can never go back once you start a new one. Why EA, why? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me.

Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability. Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to, or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested, and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings, I don't know. It's like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving, they're regressing towards oblivion. The menus are just clumsy, hard to use, and so very much worse than Sims 2. If you loved the Sims 2 menus, you will HATE these.

The camera is also bad, in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity. It seems to have a mind of its own, and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls.

Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough. All my Sims look fat, ugly, and just not what I had in mind. It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look. It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion: The Elder Scrolls. If you like plump, slightly froggish looking Sims, you'll love it.

For interior design, rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings, you are instead offered very few selections, but the ability to make them patterned. Oh joy! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas, most of them ugly, but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to! That's so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right? Not so much. This strikes me as either laziness, or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later. Except they missed the entire point: the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good!

Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history. Destroying a famed (even legendary) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal. EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing, and by the time they do that, it might be too late.

My recommendation: sell your copy on an auction site. At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else.","Broken, crashing, unfun 3rd installment in the Sims franchise"

B000ZK9QD2,1.0,"Now before i start i want to say i loved Gears of War 1. With that out of the way, Gears of War 2 is a complete disaster. From the moment i popped it into my 360 Elite to when i popped it back out after a couple hours of campaign and a few games of multiplayer. I already sold it back to GameStop. Epic should change their company name to Epic Fail because they sure did drop the ball on this game.

Where do i even start? I guess i'll start with the campaign. It's decent, just a Gears of War 1 rehash, nothing more. Definitely forgettable. The dialogue is completely childish and immature this time around throughout the entire game. Dom does nothing but [...] all game, it gets really old after about the first mission. It just feels so clunky and thrown off.

Now onto my favorite mode and what kills the game for me, Multiplayer. What the heck was Cliffy B smoking when he made this game? The multiplayer is a sheer disaster. Instead of being able to chose what type of game mode you want to play you have to vote now. You can't even choose your team. It's like Halo 3 gone wrong. It's just bad. The shotgun, which was the best weapon and most fun in Gears of War 1 has been completely dumbed down and is now one of the weakest weapons in the game. This game caters to all the Gears of War 1 cry babies that sucked at the game. If you were a lancer noob from Gears of War 1 this game will probably be right down your alley.

1/5 stars, would of gave it zero if i could. Don't buy this game, don't even rent it. Save your money, Gears 2 is just a rehash of the first game that hasn't improved at all.

Mixing adventure with action is not a good idea. If all the adventure games start doing this, they'll lose me and I'm sure other people as customers. Adventure games are supposed to be fun and intriguing, not leaving you frustrated with no more hair left on your head. That said, I actually found it to be an interesting story line and the different scenes were well done. The English translation was a little kooky and sounded stilted at times, but the message got across. I found some of the actions needed were a little unbelievable. Adam, the hero, is a bit of a weakly wimp. It was as if some of the tasks were to be done only to take up more game time.

Ok, so Blizzard's idea is online piracy but basically it's laziness and it shows.  Playing a single player game is EXTREMELY frustrating when you have massive problems waiting in line to log into an online server so you can play by yourself.  It takes what could be a great Diablo 2.5 (It really DOES feel like that) and turns it into hell itself because if there happens to be a lot of people online, you lose connection (and the dungeon resets - along with an hour or two of progress any time you temporarily lose internet connection), or the online game servers are down, you simply cannot play the game.  Oh and lag spikes during single player games are amazingly fun.  Yes this happens often when playing this game due to Blizzards' requirement to be online.

B000O3IS48,1.0,"this game is very fun.  however i give it a one star over all because of the way it was marketed.  i own and love ninja gaiden black.  i bought this game because i kept hearing about all the ""added content"" and ""improved graphics"".  the added content is quite lame.  this game actually has less to unlock than the ""black"" version, besides a few added cut scenes and a couple of addition boss battles that do nothing to enhance the story (they only provided me with irritation) this version has very little to offer.  in the way of graphics.  i was very disappointed.  its debatable that the graphics  are improved at all over ""black"".  thats not good for a next gen system.  the cut scenes which i love actually were worse because they took out the pretty cgi and used in game graphics.  the difference wasn't that apparent but when you look close there were many more jagged lines where before they were smooth.

B009IF0EUE,1.0,"Lets start this off stating that I had a pair of turtlebeach headphones x11s and sadly, after I good game rage slam, they broke. They still work, but won't sit on my head. So instead of fixing them, I decided to pick up these.
I feel the need to add that while I was holding them in the store, my wife WARNED me and I should have listened. She said, ""didn't you have an afterglow controller and HATED it and never used it?"" And I said yes and proceeded to tell her that these headsets had a compair chart on the side of the box with them and turtlebeaches. But honestly, I thought they looked cool.
I got them home and was impressed by the box, as well as impressed by the headphones themselves. Then the sadness came. I have my Xbox hooked up with an hdmi cord so naturally I hooked them up the same way my tbs were hooked up. (Using the adapter I purchased) nothing. Friends texted me saying they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them.
So I tried to hook them up to the tv, I have a tv made past 2009 so naturally it doesn't have a audio out plugs. So my next option, (according to the booklet and a video on YouTube on how to hook it up) was to plug it into the headphone jack on my tv, which is on the back and the cord from the headset is so short on that end, I had to place my Xbox behind the tv.
It WORKED!!!! Yayyy, but wait, now, the game volume on the controller makes the chat volume go up and down as well as the actual game volume, and the chat volume only makes the game volume go down. What the heck is happening, now I only have the option to play with my chat volume very loud AS WELL as the game volume and no other choice. ""Great, this sucks guys....guys? Hello?"" Oh, what a surprise, I touched nothing and they suddenly stopped working. Oh whats this, the mute button is only button with no indication as to weather your muted or not, maybe that's the problem.... Sadly, no. They never worked again.
Done, sadly I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Trust me, go get some turtlebeaches, they are the same price. These are terrible.

B00178630A,1.0,"I started playing Diablo in 1997. I even purchased the Hellfire expansion by Sierra. I also played Diablo 2 for about 10 years. I can't see myself touching D3 ever again, which is a shame. This game would be a decent arcade game, which is basically what it is. But it has almost no RPG elements, and doesn't require any sort of thought. They took out everything that wasn't broken in Diablo 2, or ARPG's in general and added a bunch of flavorless, generic, WoW inspired garbage. The only thing that would seperate a wizard from the other million or so wizards is gear. There is no choice when creating your character, everyone is exactly the same. To progress on the higher MP's in inferno you need ridiculously good gear, and you are pigeonholed into a couple of different specs per class. I don't want to rehash what everyone else has been saying, but for a decent brain-dead time waster it would be worth $15-$20 bucks. But for a Blizzard/Diablo game, it is a horrific abomination of a franchise, on par with final fantasy 14.",Decent arcade game. Horrible diablo game

After five full minutes it was still going so brave (or ignorant) man I am I took the battery out of the housing and it lightly scalded my finger tip! My special ""Day One"" controller was ruined.  No longer worked and the inside was actually melted inside.  Of course Amazon reimbursed me and sent me a new controller but it didn't say ""DAY ONE 2013"" because you cannot buy those separately.  Bummer!  I asked if they wanted it back and they said ""NO"".  Even they didn't want to mess with it.  I don't blame them.  Liability for the workers.  I am a little miffed that it wasn't checked by Amazon first.  I thought the electric items they sold were checked before they were sold.  Obviously not.

B001AYEGXM,1.0,"I really wanted to like this game, after the years of buildup, Will Wright's history of innovative design, and the (in)famous GDC demo of Spore (look it up on YouTube if you want to see what I thought they were going to publish, from a tech demo years ago). What got delivered was a severely simplified collection of minigames slapped together with some overly cute animations, shallow play, badly thought-out and misbalanced endgame (space phase), with one of the worst and most personally offensive copy protection schemes wrapped around it. In interviews post-release, Wright has basically confirmed that what was wanted by the publisher (note: not by the customer) was a simple game for casul gamers that would have superior sales, e.g. Sims 2. Unfortunately what they wound up with was a game that's too simple even for hardcore Sims fans in the early phases and perplexingly difficult in the last phase even for hardcore players, not because the game is actually more difficult, but because it's very poorly thought out.

OK, DRM scheme first, since that's what people are up in arms about and what some 5-star reviewers are apparently confused by. This version of SecuROM limits you to 3 activations, after which you can maybe possibly get more if you call EA support (toll call with long wait times and poor response) with a convincing explanation, after which they may or may not honor your purchase. In many cases, the answer is not judging by previous titles that use this limited activations scheme (Bioshock, Mass Effect) and the customer nightmares that ensured. An activation by the way is not the same as an installation; installations are a subset. An activation includes a fresh OS install, major hardware change, MINOR hardware change such as plugging in a USB device... nobody can actually tell you what constitutes an activation.

Furthermore, SecuROM, while not as overtly offensive as Starforce, does in fact install registry entries and administrator-level monitoring software in your system without your knowledge, and it cannot be removed without either a drive wipe or a multistep command line process that I would not recommend to a casual user. It gets installed as soon as you start up Spore for the first time, and you don't get told this. It is therefore part of the product and is a legitimate topic to discuss in a review (for everyone who thinks you shouldn't rate the game low because of the DRM).

The gameplay itself is charming and amusing... the first time you play it, I suppose. The first time I played it, not trying to powergame through, I made it to the space stage within a few hours, without even trying to. This was the point that I looked back at the gameplay and wanted to know, ""Is that it?"" And it pretty much was.

For those people who are offended by the idea that the game espouses evolution, don't bother. There is no actual evolution in this game. There is absolutely no natural progression from one form to the next. As long as you have the parts available, you can change from a six-winged butterfly thingy to a gazelle with nine eyes to a landgoing slug that spits poison. Your environment doesn't force any changes on you whatsoever.

The first four phases of the game (cell, animal, tribe, civilization) are incredibly simplistic versions of other genre games, and are over before you know it. At the end of each one, when I was suddenly winning without knowing how, it actually felt more like I had finished one phase of a tutorial for a bigger, more interesting game that I never got. In the cell game, it's move, eat, avoid, win. In the animal game, it's eat, attack (using the 1-4 keys), impress (also using the 1-4 keys), win. In tribal, well things get slightly more complex as you have to pick out clothing and huts, but it's still get food, impress or kill, win. In civilization, you think FINALLY here's where thingsget interesting, but only in that instead of fighting/impressing, you now have the choice of buying (with trade), killing (with military) or converting (with religious), combined with a mini-city builder game that plays more like Connect Four than Sim City.

The space phase is fairly difficult, but this is only because of logical inconsistencies and missing systems in the game. Without going too in-depth, here are some of the highlights: your empire can afford to terraform planets, bribe empires, and the like but can't build a second ship to help you out. Your empire also cannot send out a few guys with guns to hunt down diseased animals, and have to commandeer your ship (its ONLY ship) to fly around the planet, zapping sick deer with a laser. Your cities have auto-defense turrets that don't fire on the enemy. Your empire is incapable of setting up regular shipments of spice (apparently the only commodity anyone wants), and require you to move it around yourself, in between shooting sick deer, pirates unmolested by planetary defense turrets, and paying for city upgrades. What, don't planets have tax bases to put up their own houses? No, apparently it's up to you, the commander of the only ship in the empire, to put up condos for your hapless people.

I won't even go into the bugs involved in basic installation of the game, authentication errors, buggy Sporepedia, C: drive overflow (even if you install in a different drive/partition, everything goes into the My Documents folder which is in C: by default), ONE ACCOUNT PER INSTALLATION (this was supposed to be allowed and even says so in the basic edition's manual, but apparently they considered this to be a typo... even with the change account buttons present in the UI), and other numerous technical problems. You can go check the EA forums for some of those before they get deleted or locked down.

In conclusion, I have to say that you should not buy this product due to its poor shallow gameplay, insidious and anti-consumer DRM, and most of all 3-install limit. But the real question is not why would you NEED to install more than 3 times; we know the answers to that, and they are totally legitimate. The question is why you would WANT to install it even once.","Over-simplified, shallow play, poor value rentware"

B000ZKA0J6,1.0,"First off, this review is based on my experiences with many RTS games, my favorites being Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes, Warcraft III, Company of Heros, Command and Conquer (many of the titles), and many more. I'd like to start by saying that I put strong emphasis on STRATEGY and how well you are able to employ real life battlefield tactics. Also, I don't do single player a lot, but I do like it in this game, it is pretty good but this review is multiplayer only. With that said, I will start serving the meat and potatoes.

This is my first time ever playing a Starcraft game, so I was a bit nervous initially, dispute being an impatient and fast learner I was blown away at how well the tutorial was crafted. It was simple enough for a 10 year old, but it touched on key points and forced you to focus oh the lesson at hand. I felt like I was in school again, except with race horse blinders on this time. It was quick and to the point at the same time. After I completed it, I was confident in my Knowledge and decided to jump online to hone in my skills. Once online they had this kinda pre-ranked pool of players that all elected to practice against real people until they were ready for rated play. This helped me to test my skills even further. There wasn't much rushing, as there were too many choke points for it to be viable, but you got it occasionally. This pre-ranked pool helped me to hone my skills but ultimately set me up for failure in ranked.

When you fire move into ranked, you have to play 5 games to decide where you should be placed among the other ranked players. These games were not too difficult and I ended up winning 3 of my 5. FINALLY! Some ranked play!! Before you read the rest of this review, I'd like to say that I have over 60 matches played, each taking from 15min to an hour. After my first few games I noticed a trend, no choke points = get rushed punk! This became quickly annoying, so I eventually got to the point where I learned to rush as effectively or at least to properly defend while I tech. Out of about 15 games I had only won about 5, but I was learning fast. Around game 25 my games were getting better, I'd perfected about two strategies but as games went on I noticed that my weakness was not being more versatile. THIS IS WHERE THINGS GOT GOOD, and by good, I mean drop dead hilarious. As I tried many different strategies I noticed something... all of them had an equal chance of being countered, kudos on the balance, this was a plus, as nothing was the best, but some were less expected.

Your success depended on what your opponent was doing while you were putting your plan into action. Scouting seems like a big part of the game, but not much for finding out what to do in response to or opponent, but instead as a way to find other bases (if any) that your opponent set up. With that said, If I build a bunch of planes that could only attack ground in order to support my land units that could attack ground and air, If in fact my opponent had the perfect counter, It would probably be too late to do something about it once I found out.

This brings me my next point. There aren't really any tactics that you can use in this game, all of the units can span any map in seconds, ALL maps are as open as McDonald's @ 2:30 once all the drunk people realize how hungry they are, and aside from other mining spots, there really isn't much in the map. It felt like I was fighting in some wide open crater left by a sad and very symmetric meteor.

All in All, compared to many of my other favorite RTS games, this game feels like the inbreed child of rock, paper, scissors, and tic-tac-toe. You mass units, meet somewhere for a battle, and if the units you decided to mass are better than mine, well good game, and vice versa. ""YOU PICKED ROCK AND I PICKED PAPER, GG!"" That's the online experience in a nutshell, with as many tactics to employ as you can get out of Xs and Os on a 9 square field. I won't butter up this review just because everyone else does, or because it may have fans dedicated enough to try and find me. I believe that everyone deserves to know that after waiting 12 years, and paying 60 bucks, you are more than likely buying Starcraft I with better graphics, and new units (most of which you can't even use online). I don't believe this game took 12 years to make, I believe they made all 3, and want to release them at different times, so that you pay 120 bucks for a game that isn't even worth 50.

I've never played it and refuse to because of the laziness of the company not to add subtitles at least during cut-scenes.  There was an article on IGN stating that the developer ""just didn't have time"" to put them in.  That's a direct quote.  This is unacceptable.

Last Remnant is like reading the fifth book in a series; it does little to tell you who the characters are beyond 'this is there name and they are now your friend'.  Kind of odd, if you ask me.

It would have been better if they'd just made it into a ""straight to DVD movie"" that I could have rented at RedBox for a buck.

A few things about this... for one, my internet connection (at home and otherwise) is often poor and intermittent (I live in the USA)... furthermore, many times I simply have no access such as when I travel for work (airport, airplane, etc)... so already the game's usability is shot. On top of all this - I simply don't want a cloud-only based game. I want my save files and I want my backup of my save files...

B004L9WGDA,1.0,"Amazing things about this game:
Game Concept (being able to hijack certain enemies)(little secret ways to earn more points)
Music (Got some wonderful beats to go along with the game)
Character designs (especially that lady Sasha) is very well done, and has a high level of polish. (To bad the rest of the game doesn't)
Aesthetics
Character viewer is a cool concept

Things that are horrid:
Level design looks half done, it's poorly done...
Game Controls (IE how the game character responds to input.. the fighting, which is the main aspect of the game, is poorly executed. It should be smooth like Bolthouse farm Vanilla chai tea... yet its more akin to .. drinking black coffee, a horrid frustrating experience)

Gameplay (How they set the rules of the game up) are horrid... some things in the game, take more luck to pull off, than skill, just because of how they set up events. Like I'm doing a mission called ""Impeding Investigation"" during the white(good) selection of the game. This giant mining excavator goes berserk.. WEll.. not only does it kill the enemies before I can get to them, it moves fast enough to where basically all I can do is focus on avoiding it and staying alive, yet last long enough.. (it does two laps over the battlefield) to eat up a major chunk of my time limit, and then enemies spawn way to dang slow. I just beat this mission with literally 8 seconds left, and that was slaughtering enemies as fast as I possibly could. (I'm sure with a lot of practice one could beat it quicker some how, but it would also probably take luck)

I don't feel like going on, but over all its a poorly executed idea of a game. Cool in theory, but the team behind it...they suck at doing their job. That would sum it up. I was looking forward to this game, and well.. frankly I'm let down.

I've been a gamer for 20 years now. And it seems that a lot of game designers/developers, whatever you want to call them, have still yet to grasp how freaking important it is, to get the input right.. how important it is the way that the character responds to the user, how the environment responds to the user character. If their is this disconnect, this struggle to get the game to function the way it is intended, its going to be a horrible experience. I could deal with a graphically, or aesthetically lacking game, if it were a great gameplay experience.. and that's not the case with this game. Also, the camera/lock on is horrid as well. I felt like I was playing a game from th eyear 2000 or something.. gezus.

Also, the boss fight against a certain huge creature, that lives in the water, is so poorly done, that I got nauseated the second time I was forced to go through the fight. I dreaded it that much. Its a fight that get's drug out for no good reason.

Story for the game is Ok. Its simple, but good.

I played the game on Normal Difficulty. On the 360 version with a Razer Sabertooth Controller.

With a lot of missions you get 3 tries. With the last boss. You get three tries, and do to the poor game design, it took me three tries exactly. Because.. hey were gonna make a boss that flies, and give you no real way to get to him..

B00013MRU2,1.0,"I really, really wish that I had read some reviews of this game before I bought it, because now I can't return it.  I could have spent my money on something much better than this string of snapshots with voiceovers attatched.  If this game were freeware, I probably would have liked it, but it's not.  Instead, it's a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like Myst.
Incidentally, it was the references to Myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game.  The packaging says, ""Think Myst but in a real location"" (Quandary).  True, like this game, Myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with, much like this game, but there's a few big differences between Myst and this game.  Myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me, because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious, and the puzzles were so engaging.  Capri is beautiful, but moving through it is confusing and frusterating.  There are so many places where one street looks just like another, which makes getting turned around or lost really easy, unless you check the map every step of the way, and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky.  I enjoyed the scenery in Myst, but I could care less about the many, many snapshots of streets that A Quiet Weekend in Capri includes.  There should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game.  I haven't finished this game yet, but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people, which, combined with the frusterating navigation, becomes incredibly tedious.  The people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game.  It's impossible to talk to any of them, which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place.  You'd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it.  The people themselves are also snapshots, by the way.  They are never animated, even when they're talking - even Myst animated talking people.  There are, in fact, very few animations in this game.
This game has, for me, redefined bad games.  I cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released.  It's amazing to me that someone seriously thought that basing a game off of thousands of touristy photographs would be a good idea - and some of the photos aren't even all that good, blurry, with bad composition, or lens flares.  My plan is to sell this game as soon as I can.  Although I can't get cash from any of the places in my area, I can get game credit.  The next time around, I'll make sure I thoroughly research the game before I buy it.  This game may cost only twenty dollars, but it's a waste of every one of those dollars.  Do yourself a favor and get something better.  If you want to try this game, wait until it hits the bargain bins.",not at all what I expected...

B00002SUR0,1.0,"While this is a terrific game concept with some nice features, it is far more work than play. The core of the game is a standard 4X space empire builder, with colony management, a complex tech tree, tactical space and  ground combat, espionage, and diplomacy. But there is no centralized  display of colony status. A building must be supplied with both power and  workers in order to operate, and if it doesn't have enough of either, it  will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements.  You are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect  every single colony to discover these problems. But the tech system is even  worse, and has not been improved from IG1. There are three types of tech,  and so you have to have three types of labs. But you can only research one  invention at a time, so while you're developing a new hyperdrive in your  ship labs, your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle,  sucking up your colony's power and workers. If you can't afford that waste,  and most of the time you can't, you have to once again personally remember  where you placed each one of up to 30 labs, go to the colony display for  each planet on which you have a lab, and turn the idle ones off, one at a  time. If you decide to develop a new building next, you have to go around  and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again. And  I don't have room here to go into the game's futile diplomacy system, or  the sluggish screen redraw, or the constant nagging interruptions by  messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders.

1. Unless you're very careful, you WILL hit Stop when you meant to hit Pause, and you will do this OFTEN
2. Most blu-ray discs don't support auto-resume (A step backward from DVD, but I digress)

B0047TG2R0,1.0,"You'll read better reviews than this one. Others have gone into greater depth and taken more time. I want to explain briefly why I am giving this a 2/5, however.

The one word to summarize this game: BORING.

I bought this a few days ago. There's a reason, I now know, that a 10 month old game is selling for only $20 at a local big box. I hear DA: Origins was great. I never played that. Some reviewers here are reviewing DA 2 not on its own merits but as an inferior comparison to DA: Origins. I am not. I really have no horse in this race. Another reviewer said this is a terrible RPG but a great button masher. I disagree heartily. If you've ever played Diablo, that is a 50 IQ brainless button-mashing experience, but it's also unbelievably fun. This is not that. Although the combat (what little I've seen when not stuck in a dialog screen) is nothing more than idiotic smashing of A, the rest of the game is not an action adventure at all.

I have played only several hours but based on what I've experienced and read elsewhere, that's enough. Yes, I'm reviewing after only a few hours, but I don't want to play anymore. I have been playing RPGs for many, many years now and this is one of the worst impressions I've had. Here are the main problems:

1) Graphics are bad. They are quite dated in comparison to what the 360 is capable of and we've seen elsewhere
2) Terrible city design. The entire city feels like it was auto-generated. The space between buildings is absurdly large (streets you could drive parade floats down side by side) and it makes everything feel extremely artificial. Too many squares and rectangles and not enough people. It just feels unnatural. They were going for grand, they got weird.
3) Way too much talking between characters. I have spent much more time in dialog than in actual combat or doing anything in the game. The ""game"" is way too much chatter and unfortunately since it's all voiced it cannot be skipped. Voiced is fine--but only if I can skip it to speed things up.
4) You know something is wrong when you level up and can't be bothered to go into the menu to choose stats. I think the moment I hit ""auto-level up"" I realized I didn't care at all anymore and I wouldn't be playing again. I never cared, nor felt it mattered.
5) I've never had a game for only a few days and when bored (this evening) struggling to find something else to do so I wouldn't have to go down and force myself to like it.

I actually read some (not enough) reviews of this before purchase. I was expecting a dumbed down RPG with a rich story and fast-paced action, but it isn't. It's slow and uninspiring.

The game was severely rushed, and there is a reason why the lead designer of Dragon Age Origins left the company during design of this. He probably just couldn't stomach it. I know I couldn't.",I am not am embittered DA Origins fan
B00DHF3BZQ,1.0,"I bought it at Game Spot, I was expecting something easier like Manhunt 1-2, or Resident Evil, instead I got a game where you can't attack your enemies head on, you got to hide and come at them from behind. That really sucks. Survival horror? LOL, the only horror is spending $59 on a game that sucks, I hope GameSpot gives me $40 for my trade so I can get something better.

B00004U4SR,1.0,"What have they done to you D!?  This game had so much potential.  Good graphics, great story, and a huge fan base.  But they made the game slow, excessively difficult, and bland.

Searching,  I found out that Turtle Beach now, by design, hinders the volume output because of European law. I returned mine because they are worthless if you can't hear the faint footsteps of the enemy in multiplayer, or the reloading of a gun when they run out of ammo.

B00007KQC1,1.0,"I have written and rewritten this review, and this is my final offer. Any would-be buyers of this game, PLEASE take this as a caveat; I really want to convey just how lousy this game is. Any comparison of this game to the rest of the series is ludicrous, but anyway...
As I said before, you play the game as the character Ryu, a government grunt. Mankind has been forced to live under the earth due to reasons lost in antiquity, and the citizens are placed into their positions via a rating system (a ratio - the closer the ratio is to 1, the more potential a person has, and thus the greater station this person is allowed to have). Surprisingly, the higher your ratio, the closer to the surface you are allowed to live, despite the conviction that the outside world is poisonous. Anyway, the purpose of the game is to climb out from the bowels of the earth in an attempt to reach the sky. This is the story. If you find it excellent, well, to each his own, but personally,I don't think this tale stands up to the likes of Xenosaga, .hack:infection, Suikoden III, FFX, etc.
However, complicating matters is the D-Hunger gauge, against which I have railed in the past. As you progress through the game, this gauge constantly rises (increasing about 1/100 of a percent every 2-3 seconds on its own). SHould your character transform into a dragon (or use other special abilities), the rate of increase rises dramatically. Assuming you never use ANY of these abilities, however, you essentially have 20000-30000 seconds to finish your game (or about 6-8 hours). Failing at this, it is game over. In fact, you have to restart your game from the beginning. There is NO carrying over of statistics; what CAN be carried over are the weapons and armor you have equipped, any items you have stored away, the skills you have learned and ""party experience"", which can be used to boost your characters upon the replay. Furthermore, if you are considering beating the game on your first go around, don't. It is physically impossible (I know, I tried it out). I have a lot of words to describe this atrocious system, but ""realistic"" isn't the first to come to mind.
I believe in innovation, when it makes a game more fun. However, this is absurd. You want the trick to beat the game? Simply play through as far as you go twice, remembering to store all of your acquired items and NEVER use party experience. That way, on your third time through, you can buff up your characters so much that they will destroy any enemy they come across (yes, I decided to go back and finish the game). Hence, an 8 hour game becomes a 24 hour game, since every scene is seen three times. The fact that you can't save often is a blessing in disguise - saving doesn't really help you anyway (the D-Hunger gauge isn't going anywhere). Oh, and for a more ""realistic"" gaming experience, notice that you have a ""quit"" command. This command essentially allows you to save at a certain spot, and then use you dragon abilities to try to acquire certain skills and items you might not otherwise be able to acquire. Oh sure, you'll die, but you can start over at the save spot, with all of the abililities now in your repertoire. In fact, the guide (which may be the most useless instruction guide in all of gaming, oftem times confusing me more than instructing me) tells you to use this strategically. The realism is overwhelming. The moral is: if you try to beat the game on one walkthrough, forget it! Instead, the system rewards ineptitude over ingenuity.
If you are one of those (sad to say many) people who simply cannot stand the mainstream, and would sooner gouge out their eyes than play a game everyone else is playing, this might be for you. To be sure, the system is innovative, and I am sure it will never rear its ugly head again. However, if you enjoy fun game, or if you simply don't want to waste fifty bucks on a stinker, stay the hell away from this abomination. Play Xenosaga (another innovative game), or .hack, or even Final Fantasy X for the nth time. This game reeks...",This is the last time - I promise!
B0013016O0,1.0,"Same as some other reviewers here: Could NEVER get it to sync. Sending it back; obviously there are a bunch of bad ones here that don't make me feel good about Nyko :(

So, I got it to work, and it works great. How? Well, turns out the instruction manual with it is useless. While it clearly states to get both components into the 'fast blinking' stage, that does NOT connect the devices.
Once both are blinking fast, THEN hit the button one more time on the guitar. They will not connect (and stay connected). No mention of that in the manual mind you. I searched the web, and followed a many posts there).","this one broken, too (UPDATED: WORKS, the instructions are wrong)"

B00006F7S8,1.0,"I enjoyed the Simcity games and felt ripped off with Simcity 3000 as it was basically the same package as the previous Simcity.  If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing.  At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc.  If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been ""simcitied out,"" save your money and buy another title.  Sims anything sells like hotcakes and EA realizes this.  It's another attempt to cash in on the Sim name.","I loved the Simcity series, but they need to change it"

The whole snake story has been silly in 1-3, but this one is worse.  Mostly due to the boredom it creates for the player when the action stops.  Cut scenes are long and many times do not add anything to the game.  The bosses are ridiculously annoying more than scary.  I am happy I got mine used and will probably be able to sell it still.

On mine, all the characters displayed as big white boxes. According to Ubisoft support center: ""This problem can occur if you have installed a newer version of Apple's Quicktime software.  Unfortunately, the only way to resolve this issue is to uninstall Quicktime from your system, and then reinstall the version of Quicktime included on the game disk. ""

B00HHIPQ98,1.0,"Started the franchise only a couple years ago with Graces F on PS3... Loved that game. Loved almost everything about it. Thought I had found a new JRPG franchise to play.
Next game was Xillia... Thought it was pretty good. Not as fun as Graces F, but still worth what I paid.
Next was Symphonia (the remaster) and I loved it. Loved that game almost as much as Graces F; after playing this game, I started looking into future Tales games, thinking ""wow, I love this franchise."" The sequel was an atrocity, but I gave it a pass because it was free, and I've seen FF sequels be horrible, too.
Then came Xillia 2, another sequel... and I hated it. I didn't like much about it, at all... at this point, I thought ""This game wasn't free, and is now the second Tales game in a row I hated.""
Then I bought this game, reasonably excited about it going back to a more fantasy setting, like Graces. Zestiria, however, is just about the worst game I have ever played. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality, and didn't even make it 2/3 through the story before giving up (previous games I actually got the platinum trophies, which required up to 5 playthroughs). The convoluted item system was terrible, the combat was terrible, the story was terrible, the characters were terrible... Just a truly awful....awful game.

There are a lot of games lately to go in the wrong direction these days and it makes me glad that i had better games to play in the past.

B00273Y7V6,1.0,"Purchased HOI3 in December 09. I incorrectly assumed that its various bugs would have been corrected by now. I had previously played through HOI2 and EU3 (both EXCELLENT games) and had been waiting for HOI3 to go on sale. With the added DLC (not really worth it) I ended up paying around $15. The price was right, but the product... well, it left a lot to be desired. My PC is an i5-750 with an ATI 5850 and 8 GB of RAM... it games... and well, this game seemed to bring it to its knees. Eventually I gave up on finding a solution to the performance problems and stopped playing.

The good:

* It's a grand strategy game... not many people make these now.
* The game seems stable.
* Though complex, I was able to start playing almost immediately.

The bad:

* Absolutely stale graphics... even for strategy games.
* Game runs slow... very slow... even on a brutally fast PC.
* Game seems to slow down the longer your session lasts.
* Maintaining trade agreements seemed pretty tedious (but totally necessary)
* Having to register online was semi-annoying

The verdict:

I don't regret buying it... and I'm still holding out hope that subsequent patches will convince me to resume playing. Paradox doesn't ask a lot for its games and they make some really unique ones... support companies like this!

Flash forward to Battlefront EA in 2015. I played coop with my nephews, and the survival-horde mode (the only substantial mode for local coop) lasted an hour before we got bored. Some people might see my distain for Battlefront EA stemming from my nostalgia of the originals, but honestly, it deserves all the hate it gets.

If you go on IGN or Youtube, a short ad for Battlefront EA shows a quote that is NOT TRUE: ""Perfect for couch coop,"" it says. It is nowhere near close to the perfection Battlefront 1 and 2 achieved TEN years ago.

In (game) reality, the fun comes in very small, almost untraceable doses, the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items, and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar. If that doesn't chase you from the game, then the rest of this review most definitely will.

The Good:
+ The level-up system is actually rather good
+ The dialogue will make you laugh--whether it's meant to or not

The Bad:
-- Somebody let this game out into the market
-- Long sequences of boring combat
-- Many people might not even find their way out of the first castle

The Ugly:
:( The character and monster designs

Storyline--1/10

Unfortunately the script-writers don't provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue. In fact, it's laughable. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which makes things even worse. Take for example what the main character, Alaron, says when the party stops to rest. They sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on Alaron's face. He says, ""Ah! Pass the marshmallows."" Not only is this not very funny, but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests. The best line of dialogue, though, belongs to the knight, Abrecan. When the king sends Alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make Alaron (who is at the time a squire) a knight, Abrecan objects. He continuously insults his king by saying, ""You are too generous."" And each time he repeats those words, more and more of them become capitalized, expressing Abrecan's abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight. Compared to that line of dialogue, nothing else is worth remembering.

Gameplay--1/10

Many of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in, but for those who do you'll do some questing and searching through the not-so-labyrinthine-but-still-difficult-to-navigate outside areas. Most importantly, you'll be battling bad guys. That's what you bought the game for, right? To battle bad guys? For this, the game developers bumped their heads together and thought, ""What is so fun about video games?"" They made a list, narrowed it down to ""What's so fun about RPGs,"" and then, for the fun of it, made a list of ""What would not be fun in an RPG."" But somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one. Thus the combat that lasts 10 to 20 minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing. I swear, the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games. There are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting. And when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies, you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and, thus, harder to hit. ARGGHH!!! Back to square one.

On the bright side, the experience system is rather good. You can put points into different skills for each character, giving you a lot of freedom for customization. Too bad the rest of the game couldn't have been so fun and original.

Longevity--1/10

As I said, many of you will probably never leave the castle, where poor Alaron will breathe his last, but for those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to make it out and go on your quest, there's a lengthy quest here. Much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters, and very little of it consists of an engaging story. In the end, it would be much more merciful to allow Alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castle.",A 1? Now you're too generous!

B01GWGXHKK,1.0,"I'm really done with Ubisoft's Just Dance series.  We had 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and Disney on Xbox 360 and *loved* them all.  But since the jump to the current generation, beginning with Just Dance 2016, Ubisoft has decided that even if you pay $50 for their game, you still can't really play it.

In older editions, you buy the game.  No strings were attached, you could just play and play.  If you wanted to pick up additional tracks, you just purchased them as DLC (individually or in a bundle) and play some more.  In Just Dance 2017 there is no DLC, which you would think is good.  Instead, you have to purchase a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JD-Unlimited/dp/B0189VJSUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JD Unlimited</a>&nbsp;music pass for $40 a year.  As soon as it expires, your music is gone.  You own nothing.

Furthermore, even some of the songs that are included with the game (that you *paid* for!), are not available unless you sign up for Ubisoft's Uplay.  Create an account, get to play the game you already paid for.  Why?  So they can market to you and sell your information (check those terms of service).

So buy a game for which you have to keep paying for the privilege of using, and join something you don't won't for the privilege of playing the game you bought?  No.  Draw your line here - it's not worth it.",Gets worse and worse

B00RN7QSJ0,1.0,"Wow where to start with this one.. As other reviewers noted, the mouse did not come with all items listed in the description, but the packaging was neat. The software is very limited, and all but worthless. The mouse looked like a good ergonomic mouse, however once I held this for the first time I knew it wasn't going to work well for gaming or any longer than 5 minutes of use. That was the case once I sat down and used it, my wrist started to feel strained after the first 15 minutes. The problem is there is nowhere for your pinkie to rest, unless you use it with your index finger and middle finger on the left & right, and place your ring finger on the 2 top right side buttons. Using it this way you loose allot of control, and for gaming is unusable.

Something the item description lists is that this mouse has a 1 Ghz Frequency polling rate. An obvious oversight in whoever wrote this; as mouse polling rate is usually measured in hertz (hz) and this was listed in Gigahertz (Ghz) and 1Ghz equals 1000000000hz. I believe they were trying to convey a 1000hz polling rate for the mouse. I used Mouse Rate to test the response time and on average measured 450hz, with peaks in the 550 range. Which is still a very good response rate but not the 1000hz listed in the item description. I found no way to modify this in the software.

The last straw for me on this mouse was during use. I loaded up CS:GO and went into the workshop crosshair select v2 which will allow you to try out different crosshairs, and test using them on some bots which do some basic strafing. When I got into the firing range I like to test accuracy by aiming about 90 degrees away, snapping to them and try for headshots. WHEN THE MOUSE IS MOVED AT A FAST RATE IT CUTS OUT! ..... Would make it to about the 90 degrees and stop moving! I thought maybe it was just something with the DPI/CPI setting (800 at the time) so I kicked it up through all levels, and found it to happen on all settings. After this find I unplugged the mouse, put it back in the box, and filed a return for refund.

In conclusion, I know what is listed on paper in combination with it's price point sounds attractive, but the mouse just fails to deliver on all fronts. Not sure what Sentey was thinking with this one, as in my experience they generally make a great products. The mouse I received was more than likely defective, but with the ergonomics also in mind, I could not use this mouse, and would suggest regardless of hand size, that you look elsewhere for a mouse for any application.

Side Note: Before this was even picked up for refund, I ordered the Steelseries Rival. Would heavily suggest check it out.",Avoid this mouse
B001B1W3HA,1.0,"A friend of mine gave me dozens of Wii games and this game was among those. Seeing it, I thought, ""Oh, cool, MiniGolf will be fun,"" and my daughter and I got ready to play. It is the Wii, so I expected it to be a bit of a cartoon and to have some unique animations. That wasn't a huge concern. What I got was some abomination of MiniGolf with hideous graphics, terrible game play, horrendous minigames, and revolting physics and awful accomplishments. Yes, this game is bad enough for me to grab a thesaurus. I wanted a simple MiniGolf game. That's it. Don't call something MiniGolf when it is only *sort of* that.

Let's start with the graphics. Could they be worse? Yes. Yes they could. Could they be better? Absolutely. The golfers look fine for Wii golfers. The problem with the graphics is on the courses, which is where graphics are more important. I am no artist, but I am also not all that picky. There are Apple IIe games that I continue to play in spite of the graphics there. The issue here is that perspective is bad--it is hard to tell what is flat, what is hilly, and steepness of hills. Most of the time, you just have to experiment. I suppose you could eventually get used to it...but why would you want to?

The game play is ridiculous. We had to just sort of guess with how hard we would swing. Sometimes it seemed almost random. Unlike Wii sports golf, this does not respond in any intuitive manner. The swing once that would barely budge the ball one time would fire it to the moon the next. Couple that with the terrible physics, which were not helped by the perspective. Hills that should send a ball downhill faster than Lindsay Lohan's career end up barely moving the ball at all. In a few of the maps (and we only played 8 before just giving up), the ball seemed to struggle to go downhill. Hard to say if this was physics or just bad perspective, but either way it made the game a bit pointless to play.

Every now and then we would find ourselves randomly in minigames. I don't mind minigames. Heck, I still fire up my PS2 every now and then to play Blitzball on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-X/dp/B00005TNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy X</a>. These are boring and nearly impossible. These games include some sort of wannabe Flappy Birds and a game where you use the control to catch eggs in a basket. Yes, really. They are a giant waste of time and serve no purpose other than the distract from an already worthless game.

Each of the rounds includes random coins that I am sure do something when you play a career mode. There are also random things that block you (coins). In one farm round, you have to crack eggs and bounce off of chickens. Seriously, what is this. You had ONE JOB Carnival Games. ONE JOB. Just give me a MiniGolf game, sheesh. And while we are at it, I don't need someone telling me a story about each of the holes. All I want is a quick flyover, not someone making corny (or ""carny""--ha!) jokes like the one I just made. I didn't even pay for this game, and I want my money back.",Awful. Horrible. Terrible.

B00178630A,1.0,"The greed of activision-blizzard, and the absense of most of the people who made D2 and its expansion a success are sorely apparent in the mess that is D3.

The game was launched in a semi-beta state, the servers used to play it (being online only) were also apparently poorly set up and planned, as many, many people had issues for a few days after launch (unable to connect, loosing connection often, obscene amounts of lag, ect). The item system (which basicly MADE D2 the legend that it is) is fubar, the item prices on the Auction House are hyper-inflated, due to hackers and item duplication already becoming a problem (funny that was the main, if not one of the main, reason's why blizzard didn't give us an offline / true single-player mode.. they claimed it was to make hacking/exploits harder to do)

The auction house is apparently what blizzard -really- built the game around, as they will make money off of every (real money) transaction that goes thru on it. The game itself is incredibly short and easy to max level on (i was level 60, the current level cap, within 3 days of semi-casually playing). Inferno difficulty, the supposed ""end game"" of D3, is hard and unbalanced to the point of being..well.. pointless.

Character customization and differant builds/playstyles? also gone. Everybody gets the same skils, at the same time, with the same potency. The only difference is what gear you are using, which will -ONLY- increase your skill's damage, or your vitality (hit points) or your resistence to various types of damage. So everybody will wind up basicly playing the same character class. EVERYbody. The 3 diff mercs you can hire once you find them? Also next to useless once you get into the later stages of the game, simply because they don't scale that well in relation to your own character, and the only thing you can do to improve them is their weapon, and 3 pieces of gear (amulet and 2 rings)

To summerize, the only improvement they've made over D2 is the music / sound effects, and to a lesser extent, the graphics. As it stands now, this very well could be the game that significantly wounded, if not outright killed, the diablo franchise. Had i known then (when i pre-ordered) what i know now, i would not have spent the $110 on the collectors edition, and im not sure i would have even shelled out the $60 for the regular edition.

Edit : adding this after the new patch (1.03) was rolled out today. Changing my rating down to 1 star each, because they have pretty much proven that they do not care what their rapidly-dwindling fan/customer base thinks or wants. This new patch has increased gold repair costs for your gear by roughly 4x, WHILE drasticly reducing or outright removing the effect magic/gold find has on chests, barrels and all the other in-game ""containers"" which can spawn loot. Now, it wears down your gear simply by destroying objects in the environment. What this means is essentailly they are putting an IN-GAME GOLD TAX on everything you do or are subjected too (fighting, breaking/opening containers/objects, dying) while reducing the amount of gold/magic items, or the chance to get them.","A good franchise, semi-ruined by corporate greed"

B00J4YZIZ0,1.0,"For someone who did not buy this early after release , i don't know how bad the bugs were before the latest patch. However , i can confirm as of 9/17/15 that this game is playable but extremely dull and boring. The game economy is that of a free to play mobile game and even though i got it dirt cheap , it's a massive waste of $10. But the biggest setback is that you cant start a new game , even if you delete your old save , the game will download your last save from the cloud. So stay away if you like replaying games.

Pros:
1. Amazing Graphics , even though many call it poor optimization the graphics are well ahead of most current games and can run at 30 to 40 FPS on a stock GTX 970.
2. Arno made made me laugh once.

Cons:
1. Boring Story , no where near as good as the previous games. The story stopped making any sense after Assassins Creed 3 but the last installments (Black Flag and Rogue) at least had good game play to compensate.
2. Free to play model game. Ubisoft might as well make this a free game instead if they want to keep this up. Example : Good gear costs around 100,000 to 200,000 and a phantom blade is 1,000 each. Each mission gave me about 500 to 2,000 coins. Good luck if you ever miss your shots which you will since the first five Phantom Blades I got vanished through the same enemy's head. Does it happen all the time ? I don't know since i'm not a ten year old with his mom's credit card. But you're probably thinking GTA Online got away with this. Because GTA Online is actually fun and is accompanied by a single player mode with an exciting story and no in game currency purchases.
3. No replaying the game or starting from scratch. I don't know if this is their way of protecting the in game currency which you have to buy or another bug which got overlooked. Either way . they haven't fixed it as of September 2015 , so most likely they won't fix this. Either way they probably know no one would want to replay this since it's awfully boring.

By all means avoid Unity and try all future Assassins Creed titles before you buy them.","NO RESTARTING THE GAME , PLAGUED BY IN GAME PURCHASES"

B00BEEFNVM,1.0,"**UPDATE** Mad Katz support got back to me but ignored the info I sent them about it not entering pairing mode and tried to tell me it's because my computer doesn't have BT 4.0 (which is bunk- the computer is 2 weeks old, hot off the Apple assembly line- and yes, it has BT 4.0) and also that the mapping software that lets all the extra buttons function ONLY WORKS WITH THE DONGLE

with some fiddling I got it connected on the OSX side anyway, but the thing disconnects CONSTANTLY. Not only that but in games every time you enter a menu, when you exit, this mouse points your view straight up. Between that and the constant disconnects this mouse is absolutely worthless for everything, especially gaming. I'm not even going to bother trying it on the Windows 8 side. This thing is still junk.

In short-
Calling it a gaming mouse is misleading. It barely functions as a mouse
Calling it Bluetooth compatible is misleading since most of the functions require the dongle
Calling it OSX compatible is misleading since they don't give you any instructions to connect it on OSX and, if the tech support guy is right, it won't work at all on older Macs with BT 3.0- which part of what makes Bluetooth a useful technology is that it's backwards compatible.

I'll say it again: Junk.

*Original Review*
There are no instructions to pair the mouse to OSX- it just says in the booklet ""consult the manual for your equipment manufacturer. Following the directions for Windows 8 on the Windows 8 partition of my Mac I discovered that the thing won't enter pairing mode. It says to hold down the wing button and precision mode button for 5 secconds until the blue LED quits flashing for 3 seconds. That never happens and both OS's fail to connect to it without entering pairing mode. I'm not about to use a dongle- that's why I spent 60 freaking dollars on a bluetooth mouse- to free up a USB port and keep from having to worry about losing the stupid dongle. So far it's the only Bluetooth device I've ever used that has required tech support to get the thing paired and connected and as such it gets a big fat F. We'll see if tech support gets it resolved but based on the other reviews I'm not holding out much hope. And also I'm packing it back up to go back to where it came from because I found a different mouse that works fine, so Mad Katz tech support has a limited amount of time.

Microsoft Sculpt comfort mouse- way easier to connect, works perfectly on Windows and OSX, and it's about $26- less than half the price of this junk.",So far so bad

B0000TSR4W,1.0,"I bought this game a few weeks ago from Target for $23.52 (it also included a 2nd disc with tips) I had a $5 coupon as well.  This game is unbelievably frustrating I can't believe reflections spent nearly 3 years developing this game.  While the graphics are nice and some how impressed me some what it doesn't make up for the frustrating and dull gameplay. Here is a list of cons because there just aren't enough positives things to say about this game.

CONS
Driving controls are very sensitive and your car tends to slide like as if it were on ice

on foot controls (I like to call it run n gun) are cumbersome to say the least and the aiming system isn't very good at all either.

Did I mention that this game is on the difficult side and sometimes very frustrating?  I was on the mission where you had to stop the gator for good and trying to drive and shoot at the same time just PO'd me right off.

I have played other games similar to this True Crime Streets of LA The Getaway and of course GTA.  Driver may of pioneered this genre but this installment was just poorly put together.  Many games of this genre may come and go but Grand Theft Auto is still king of the genre.  If you are really interested in checking out this game I strongly recommend renting this (I wish I had done so) or waiting for the price to drop to under $20.",Impressive graphics don't make up for a lackluster game
B0013RC1W4,1.0,I couldn't keep playing this game. The controls are awkward. The objective points were difficult to reach.

I've heard people say they beat the first boss on their 2nd try bul*******! That's NOT possible unless you use Co op.

Please creators of this game, it looks so damn good and is dark but it is impossible to play. Please make a game that average players can enjoy.

B000ZK7ZOY,1.0,"PSN ID GremDUDE. Okay, I really wanted to like this game. There were things I did like but the killer for me were the checkpoints. I don't mind difficult games and the controls were not that difficult. Yes the pistol is a pea shooter but that didn't bother me that much because there is generally plenty of ammo. The grappling can be fun and this was the main draw for me. I made it to the second part of the game--the industrial complex. There is a part where you have to jump to a building and kill the five guys there. No big deal. Then you have to jump across to another building. Once there, you kill 16 guys and then have to jump to another building. THis is all one checkpoint. The fights are not hard. I was never killed by the moron AI in this game. The platforming is just way too unforgiving. The game starts off by saying that you can fall off a building. Sure, as long as there is no water as this idiot drowns in 5 seconds flat. Even considering the fact that the Bionic arm weighs him down, he should be able to hold his breath for at least 15 second. Long enough to find a grappling point to get out of the water. Nope--5 freaking seconds. So if you fall in water, you are dead. If you go the wrong way and hit some radiation, you are dead. In other words, I killed those same 21 guys four times just because I missed a jump and fell into the water. Linear? Hell yes. There is only one way to get to the destination. Some person mentioned that Killzone was linear. Duh, it is a standard first person shooter. You never get the feeling in that game that you can explore the entire area. Bionic Commando fools you with the wide open landscapes and makes you thing that you can go all over the place. Radiation everywhere and water makes sure that this is not the case. When it comes right down to it, this game is not fun and I returned it to Gamestop in one day. I will take a straight linear shooter any day over this crap...

EDIT: Actually I ended up giving this game another chance and made it all the way to the second to last level. I didn't finish the game(that part jumping from jet to jet just frustrated the hell out of me) but is is worth the price once you get used to the grappling. Mastering the grappling skill in this game is essential!! The boss battle with the gigantic robotic worm alone is worth giving this game a chance. PSN user GremDude",It's A'ight

B000038ABO,1.0,"This is basically a chicks game, with toned down action, and horror themes designed to appeal to girls fears, most guys won't like it. More basically it's a failed experiment in game design. They had an interesting problem here with figuring out how to blend two contradictory game models: rpg vs survival horror, or leveling vs running away... But it doesn't work. The only thing interesting to me, in concept not execution, are the battle and weapon upgrade systems. The battle system mixes real time evasion with rpg atb, the problems are: enemies too fast, mostly undodgeable area attacks, slow character and enemies cast a slow spell to make you slower,and there's no room to move in the field. The weapon system has it's own problem with annoying penalties, and inconveniences. There are serious problems with pacing and story development, cutscenes vs playtime, and level design. The writers think that techno babble is story when it's just a plot device. The are parts in the game when you'll watch/read 15 minutes of cutscene, go do something boring that takes 5 minutes(like pressing against a box tapping x trying to get it to open) and then watch/read 20 minutes of cutscenes. The difficulty of the game is annoying, it's mostly designed to move you along like a movie but then will drop in cheap insta kill attacks. A lot of the rooms are empty except for graphic decoration, there is no dramatic action, plot element, or puzzle to solve, and exist only to hold a key to the room next door. Monsters infinitely respawn at doorways, and there's no way to pass but to fight them again. The monster design ranges from silly and lame like random placement of arms and legs, down to embarrassing like the final boss, who has a giant peepee for a tail, and a n-t sack hanging off his -ss. For most of the game you'll hear the same two song: overworld arpeggio, and battle theme. Camera angles suck. I could go on critisizing but it's tedious. This game is obsolete and only of interest for game design students.",It's parasite eve not parasite steve

B005THAX5Q,1.0,"I had never thought I would see a game that was more grossly disappointing then ""Duke Nuke'em Forever"". Well one came out. And it had to be an even more iconic franchise, indeed it was the franchise that cemented the idea of what military science fiction should look and sound like. More horrible is the thought that ""Aliens"" is thee biggest influance of pass and current titles from other movies to book and video games; Doom, Halo, StarCraft even Dead Space all take inspiration from that second film.

Waking up on release day I first checked IGN to see what they had to say about Aliens: Colonial Marines. A rating of 4. Bad.  That was their official review.

But never the less IGN is known to have impossible high standards and most people seem to disagree with; plus one should never speak ill of any product without testing it yourself.

Oh Dear god IGN was Right. It's a horrible game.  This is why there is Gamefly.

Despite touting special sound effects from the movies, James Horner's music and voice talent by both Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen this game STILL fell several miles short. The graphics would be good if this was an Original Xbox game, there are next to no particle effects and the sound is muted. The music isn't as loud as it should be and seriously lacks that driving percussion that fallowed the latter half of the second Alien film, there is no satisfying ""thud"" as bullets smack into things or a meaty crunch as exoskeletons break apart like Dungeness crab legs, absolutely everything is half assed here, so much that the 2010 version of Aliens Vs Predator is massively superior game.

The plot is this, you rescue Hicks. That's really it in a nut shell, turns out Hicks wasn't in his cryo-chamber when the other ones where jettison because Wayland Yutani PMC had boarded the ship and took him hostage. You go find him, disrupt Wayland operations, kill a lot of Xenos and PMCs, that's it.",How could this Happen?
B004774IPU,1.0,"I've purchased download software from Amazon before, Norton360 to be exact. It was simple, download from Amazon and then install, you're done.

B002673XJA,1.0,"Complaint one. This game is based on the alternate history of the Federation which was established in the latest movie (which I hated). I should have thought of that. Assumption of something else is my mistake. The game has none of the long established atmosphere of star-fleet and no feel of any of the long history, wardrobes or weapons from past shows and movies.

Complaint two. Massively multi-player means something totally different to me. The game keeps local player counts low with several schemes that make the game experience frustrating. I am unimpressed with the online experience. I am very disappointed. After playing real MMORPGs like Battleground Europe, this game is pathetic and 10 years behind.

Complaint three. Was this game originally designed to be played on a PC? I thought it was but it is as clumsy to control as any ""console ported to computer"" game I have ever bought. This game was beta like forever and a day and this is what I get? I feel ripped off. I expected so much more. I at least expected more freedom of movement and responsive control of the game character.

Complaint four. Why are the graphics so bad? I expected more modern standards. No eye candy here. Room based content with transitions keeping the action broken up. I know it's that way to limit bandwidth and server load and that makes it more insulting. Mostly distracting and a generic rendering at best. Rip off.

B000BC38LA,1.0,"At first Oblivion was a great game. The graphics are phenomenal, the gameplay and customization are excellent and everything about the game is likable. I played Elder Scrolls and absolutely hated it, however Oblivion is an exceptional game I found myself addicted for 2 weeks straight. Its certainly not everyones cup a tea but I cant see how anyone who likes Action/Adventure/RPGs would not like Oblivion.

With that said I also had tremendous issues regarding this game. 30 hours into Oblivion a Friar (NPC) was not following me anymore as he was suppose to be. I backtracked for about 15 mintutes or so and was easily able to find him. However, the NPC would not move one bit and after calling tech support I came to understand that there was a good chance of a corrupted save file. Tech support was suppose to email though so that I could figure out how to send them a copy of my save file so they could rule out Technical issues, I asked how long and he replied, ""5 minutes once I hang up."" Well after 30 minutes and no email I decided to go ahead and start over. Well, another 26 hours in and I was having more serious problems. First off I would fall right through bridges and into the water, secondly Weapons/Armor/Items wich were placed in storage disappeare, and also I was being arrested when I had no bounty on my head, etc. There was a whole slew of problems I had while playing Oblivion. On top of those major issues mentioned there were several cases of glitches, walking on air, etc. After an exchange and another 15 hours I was having similar problems. Normally I wouldnt have even started over the first time, but it was a great game and I was enjoying it very much. But after 3 different games and 2 different discs I had enough. Oblivion is no longer in my house and I certainly cant say its a spectacular game. And by no means do I have a crappy PC, Im running a P4 at 3.4, w/ 512 SDRAM, and a NVidea 6800 card running all a decent setting, nothing too high for what I have.

So while Oblivion is a fantastic game I have to suggest to anyone buying to do so w/ caution. idk what my deal was and perhaps never will because of a half backside tech support who didn't seem to honestly care what my problem was. But the gameplay and game alone imo are worth at least buying and experiencing for youself. Its truely a solid game and has sooo much to offer.

B000WMEEB2,1.0,"I loved the game play. It looks like a wacked out cartoon in the best way, and it's a lot prettier than Fallout. The quests are in depth, and really fun as long as you stick to the main quest, (though some of the side quests can get pretty old...)

The only complaint I have about this game is the Corruption of game files. It's not a game play-problem, but a programming one. One glaring and horrific enough that you'd think they'd fix it before the game was released.

I bought this game as a present for my boyfriend and we played for over 10 hours on our first run. We loaded the game up fine a few subsequent times, but two days later we try to load up and suddenly his character is corrupted! A level 26 Beserker gone in an instant. I looked online and apparently this is a common problem that the game programmers didn't fix before releasing, (which doesn't make me think much of them, despite the awesome game.)

I'm currently powerlevel-ing him up, but it doesn't go fast or easy with my 26 Hunter. The point is, I shouldn't have too. It's frustrating and annoying as frilly heck and I resent it like you wouldn't believe.

I've read that the problem comes from not going in and saving properly, (apparently auto-saving isn't reliable,) and shutting off the game during play, or from having the power go out while you're auto-saving. Another thing is that if you get disconnected from Xbox Live don't reconnect right away. Quit and save and THEN reconnect, or there's a chance your file will corrupt too.

Way too much fricking corruption.

The game is worth playing, but take precautions to always save and exit properly. That, or don't get too attached to your character.",Corruption

This was supposed to be a squad based game but you were mostly solo. The voice overs sounded very scripted and poorly written. The whole game took place at night and during the rain hence the ""Rain"" in the title. The vampires themself moved like they had some type of muscular disorder. They were wobbly,shaaaky,and slow, until they found you and then all of a sudden they were Flash Gordon and could leap on top of three story building. There were no check points or saves so you when spent 30 mins playing a mission and died, you got the joy doing all over again just to spend another 30 mins and die the same spot. ""I shot that undead freak 20 times and he still came at me full force."" This could have been a real worth while game and might have even spawned a series, but alas, it was anything but fun.

B0016Q4UJE,1.0,"This is the worst port I've played in a long time. And I thought Mass Effect was bad. By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.

The controls are lousy. You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail. The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping. Miserable to play throughout.

The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s). I can't get decent frames no matter what. I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics. Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly. Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish. The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.

Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash. It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.

Unfortunately the hard drive is dead.  The console can detect it, but I can't access it to create gamer profiles.  Games are unable to save progress to it.  Removing the drive and reattaching it multiple times did nothing.  The console hangs for over a minute whenever I choose any action that touches the hard drive.

As several others have noted, the outer package box seal was broken and not even resealed.  The games were inside, but the hard green plastic box they came in was broken in two places (shards of plastic were loose inside).  There were plenty of scrapes and dings on the outer box too.  The plastic covering the console itself had been opened and retaped.  The console seemed physically undamaged.

This game is horrible, and if you say otherwise you're in bad need of therapy because you're so desperate for a video game that you've convinced yourself this is worthy of your time.

Or maybe your time is truly that worthless...in which case you should contemplate drastic measures.

First off, the game is VERY linear.  ""Call of Duty 2"" truly felt like an open battlefield, whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland.  Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful, but how about those character animations?  The mouths aren't synched to the dialogue, and they do that mindless hand-waving thing when they talk...just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64.

The AI is horrible.  In Call of Duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him.  In this one you CAN---but you just don't care to.

Also---""IT'S GLITCHERIFFIC!""  I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air, completely off the top of the screen!  I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack----the friggin' dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards.  Mind you, he was in the standing position the entire time.  Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard.

This game left a stale taste in my mouth, and really just pissed me off.  Call of Duty 2 was 360's only killer app.  If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game---all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack!  They could've added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2's campaign missions and I would've paid $60, cash on the barrelhead son.

B00178630A,1.0,"It's impossible to decide where to begin.  The only reason this game sold so well is because Diablo I and II were so well loved and truly brilliant gaming.  The developers keep using this as some ridiculous sign of success.  Diablo III is garbage.  We only bought Diablo III because Diablo II was brilliant, not because you made a decent game.
A horribly disrespectful development team, ridiculously bad item drops, repetitive boring game play with nothing to draw you back, terribly laggy servers, no way to succeed without spending lots of cash in the real money auction house, actually no way to succeed because there's nothing to succeed at.
Everything revolves around the real money auction house.  You keep playing to find better items so that you can sell them to buy better gear so that you can find better items.  Utterly pointless.  Useful gear is incredibly expensive and will cost you a chunk of real cash to even be competitive.  Oh wait, there is no competitive aspect to this game.
What an embarrassingly bad game.  It should never have been released in its initial state lacking in so many basic features.  In 25 years of gaming, truly one of the worst pc gaming failures of all time.

Update 7/9/2016:  I've played through a couple of the latest seasons. Yes, the updates are being called seasons.
I've ultimately found that playing this game again is completely unrewarding.  You grind and grind to gear up your character when in reality there isn't the slightest chance you're going to make it onto the leaderboards.  The only way I would consider even playing again were if Blizzard decided to bring back the real money auction house.  That might make things a bit more interesting again.

B00273Y7V6,1.0,"Given the dearth of WWII Strategy Games, you really want to like this game.  The complexity is awesome, too.  Be any country.  You decide where the research $'s go, and what kind of a military you will build.  Are you a Strategic Bomber believer?  Take that path.  Are you a Blitzkrieg believer?  Research that strategy and arm your troops accordingly.

Are you an obsessive compulsive logistician, who believes that unless every soldier has an 8 lane highway running directly from him to the factory, he will be dead of starvation in 30 minutes? No?

Then this game is most certainly not for you.

You spend 10 hours building a magnificent war machine, just to see it wither on the beach.  So you invade a port city, like Cherbourg or Naples.  And you capture it.

Sorry.  The port's not large enough.  Your 200,000 troops can't get the supplies they need.  You have to sit there and try to hold the city while you simultaneously try to upgrade your port until it's 3 or 4 times the size of Antwerp or the Port of New York.

Because anything less than that is only going to support Perhaps 10 units - and the enemy will surround you with 30 or 40 in about 5 minutes.

COULD you find a way to win?  Sure.  But don't call it a simulation.  Call it a game.  A game for obsessive compulsive supply-chain-aholics.  Instead of General Eisenhower, you get Felix Unger.

What happened in June of 1944 could simply not be replicated here.  The number of troops on the Cotentin, if modeled here, will be unable to move.  Literally.

And then you will see a division of Germans - 10,000 troops - rout 250,000 of your own soldiers, because you are out of supply... even though you completely dominate the sea lanes.

A bit of this would add realism.  Ike *did* struggle to supply the troops, and Patton eventually had to be told to stop.  But Ike also got the Red Ball Express going, and there's simply nothing like that in this game.

No, in this game - and that's all it is - you will have to build 20 ports, and expand them to ridiculous capacity, and build highways as you go.

B011L4D30W,1.0,"We decided to go ahead and upgrade our console to the XBox One this year from our 360. Set it up today to discover the family timer we relied on ALL THE TIME on the Xbox 360 was not included in the XBox One and STILL isn't there after several years of the console being out.

Why do I care so much? This is a daily struggle for parents. The Family Timer allowed us to give our children the freedom to play the Xbox without fighting about it every day.

What does this mean for our family? We will set the same limits we had before, but now every time they play I will have to track it (makes my life worse), then when their time is up, I will have to fight with them about it. EVERY DAY.

Hmm, let me think about what that does to the XBox brand in my mind as a parent? Do I want my children to own more games? On this thing we fight about every day? NO! In fact I really wish I could just return the thing RIGHT NOW, given that we nearly only bought it so the kids could play Lego Dimensions, since all the reviews say the Xbox 360 version doesn't work.

Speaking of the dialogue, everything the host says is unnaturally spoken and choppy.  They spliced it together terribly, making it seem like a broken translator.  The questions are terrible, and often the game won't recognize what you input or change it to something completely different, even if your answer is up there.  The graphics are atrocious.  Everything is hideously ugly.  It uses your Miis, but only the faces, the rest of the animation is choppy and poorly implemented.  Your Mii characters look like broken puppets on the screen.  The game gives you a few options for backdrops and show themes, but after choosing them it never shows up.  You can unlock some videos from the actual Family Feud show, which is nice if you are a fan of recent incarnations of The Feud, but it's a small and useless extra in a game that just plain stinks.

there is honestly no excuse for a snowboarding game to be thrown together like this. not after we saw the greatness of SSX Tricky and SSX 3. those games did just about everything right. from the controls, to the trick list, to the character customization. this game did none of that right. everything is so simple, limited, and poorly implemented its horrible. it feels more slapped together than a Courtney Love makeup job.

the only redeeming qualities this game has to offer: a good soundtrack for the most part, and fun online. getting a few friends together for a trip down the mountain can be entertaining (wears thin after a couple days though)

the fact that this outsold Prince of Persia(the other big ubisoft holiday game) is a travesty. to be fair though, neither game lived up to their expectations or potential. the thing is, where prince of persia is barely above average, this is just awful. barely worth a rental if you ask me.

B00Z7V9P8K,1.0,"Way way too much batmobile. I thought the batmobile would be more of neat gimmick, i.e. GTA style but it is not. You are forced to use the batmobile way way way way too much.

Also this game has *specific* ways you must defeat certain enemies, which made for many infuriating moments and I had to use the internet to figure out how to get past enemies. Specifically the big gunners, you must pummel, dodge, pummel, dodge over and over until they go down. Any other technique you use they are invincible too. The 1st big gunner I encountered, I snuck up and hit, then hid, over and over for 10 minutes and he would never go down. I used bombs on the walls, the ground, cape stuns, flying kicks, I really thought it was a glitch cause he was invincible. Then I google how to beat them, and I take him down in 10 seconds. So stupid!!

The worse one though was the Pyg side mission, you must use an environmental take down, which I forgot was even a thing. So you can imagine how long this took. I beat up the 50 thugs he threw at me, and then marvelled at Pyg's ability to repeatedly dodge countless batarangs, cape stuns, punches every time. He just moved around a very tiny table, and Batman of all people *can't* touch him. Seems impossible right? Then I again have to google how to beat him, 2 seconds later with Square and X and goes down. Beyond stupid!!!!

Like I get it, they designers wanted to have ""cool"" finishes to the battles, but what they instead did by forcing users to do this is make for a very UNREALISTIC and INFURIATING game.

I can't stress enough how ANGRY I was at this game so often while playing it. No other Batman game in the series did this. And then to top it off I spent half my time in the batmobile, which is really a TANK and I'm forced into these TANK battles. How is this a Batman game at this point? And I stress I'm not exaggerating, HALF THE GAME is TANK BATTLES. Which I hated, and I was bad at it, so I kept dying, and had to hear the same cut scene spiel, something like ""You never stood a chance Batman"", then wait 45 seconds for it to load, then die again over and over. Honestly if there was an option I would have paid for DLC to *remove* the batmobile from the game!!!!

Finally, the game breaking bug at the end of the game was the cherry on top. I've learned from reading in forums that after beating the Scarecrow, you need to capture at least 7 of 14 of Gothams Most Wanted in order to activate the final ""Knightfall Protocol"". Specifically, you beat Scarecrow, and then it wants you to capture ""at least 1 more of Gothams Most Wanted"". So you can capture 8, or 9 etc, and then you decide when to trigger the ""Knightfall protocol"".

HOWEVER, I beat every side mission before taking down the Scarecrow EXCEPT all the Riddler puzzles. Which now means in order to activate the ""Knightfall protocol"" (i.e. capture 1 more most wanted) I need to capture the Riddler. But to get the Riddler to come out, I need to spend the next few nights hunting down 243 Riddler puzzles. You're kidding right??? Even if I knew precisely where they were, that's just *busy work* at this point. Batman, the world's greatest detective can't figure out where the Riddler is on his own?

And note, had I just been lazy and did the bare minimum of 7, I could see the ending. But since I did 13 of 14, I fee like I'm being punished and I don't get to see the ending unless I want to spend so much more time.

Thankfully on youtube I got to see the ending, but man this game I tell you!!! It's just the worst of the 4 Arkham games. Graphics are amazing the the overall story would make a great comic book, but the game play is INFURIATING!! So very INFURIATING.",Game breaking bug at the end

B00140P9BA,1.0,"I am not reviewing the content of the game except to say that Bioware has previously never disappointed me with its RPG's, and I expect Mass Effect is no different. I was highly excited to buy this game.

However, I like many others, canceled my pre-order when I discovered that I was not actually going to be buying the game, even though I was going to be spending $50 on it.

The truth is that this game comes with a new generation of digital rights management software called SecuROM. This DRM system does many things.

First, if your gaming computer does not have internet access then you cannot activate and play the game at all. Bioware/EA does not want your business.

Second, Bioware allows you three 'activations' only. Activations are tied to your computer's hardware and operating system configuration. If you ever reinstall windows, or upgrade a videocard, or add a new hard-drive, or even a simple cooling fan, you will need to use up another activation to keep playing mass effect on your computer. Several customers used up all three activations within a couple of weeks of buying the game as they tried reinstalling windows, or upgrading hardware, to overcome technical difficulties. Once you run out of activations and try to play the game again, you get a message informing you that you have no more activations left and that you should buy another copy of the game to get more. If you do some searching, you will find out that EA says that they may provide you more activations, on a case by case basis, if you contact them. They refuse to state what circumstances will be considered acceptable to them before allowing you more activations. At a minimum, you may need to provide a copy of your purchase receipt. You do actually keep your purchase receipts for $50 games right?

Third, SecuROM is a highly controversial piece of software. Its existence is not disclosed on the box, nor do you get notified that it is being installed on your machine. SecuROM installs registry keys that are not deleted when you uninstall the game. And these registry keys use illegal characters to prevent the user from being able to delete them manually. You must use third-party software to do so.

Fourth, SecuROM can include a module that provides 'information' to the game publisher. Bioware claims it is not using that module to do so, but there is no way to verify this.

Fifth, Bioware cancelled the re-validate online every 5-10 days policy that they originally stated the game would have. Expect to see this return in future games.

Lastly, Bioware/EA provides no method to de-activate a computer once it has been activated. Uninstalling the game from one computer does not free up that activation. Therefore, your ability to sell your copy of the game second-hand, guaranteed in the Copyright Act (Doctrine of First Sale) has  been violated by Bioware/EA. Expect to see some lawsuits before too much longer.

If you think I'm blowing up the DRM issue out of proportion then, by all means, go ahead and buy this game. While you are able to play it I'm sure you'll be very happy with it. However, do not expect to be able to keep playing it years into the future without paying extra for more activations.

The same DRM system is also intended for use on EA games like Spore, and likely also Dragonage, plus many others.

If you are concerned about this kind of practice becoming the industry standard, then I urge you not to spend your money on this game or any other titles from EA until they abandon this DRM fiasco. There are games publishers who take a different approach (for example, the game Sins of a Solar Empire is DRM free) and who are much more appreciative of your custom.",Rental versus purchase: Beware

B00CRN9UWC,1.0,The code has been used.. wasted all my time and gas getting it..,code has been used! Really
B00D4WTO1M,1.0,"Thought I'd try this again after a few months - it's actually gotten worse.  Hardly anyone plays online, and those that do are clans.  So, if you're playing solo, expect to have a horrible experience.  If you can get into a match at all.  Matchmaking can sometimes take longer than playing the actual match.  Even playing against bots (wargame), you will wait and wait and wait for enough players to join.  And all the terrible game mechanics are still there; spawning in front of enemy bullets, getting killed 6 feet around corners, lag, frame drops, glitches, host migrations... the list goes on and on.  This game truly deserves zero stars.

FINAL ANALYSIS: It's boring, frustrating, and oftentimes maddening.  Activision insults us by forcing these horrible maps on us with the release and then tries to sell us the 'good' maps in a DLC.  And now these new weapons (Maverick and Ripper) feel like pay to win.  Maybe they'll sell perks like ""no-host-disadvantage"", ""frag-the-lag"", ""shoot-first-kill-first!"", and ""dedicated-servers-for-dedicated-players"".  I'm being only half-sarcastic; I really can see this happening, especially with the cast of clowns at Activision.  COD is dead to me now and forever.  Time to move on!

UPDATE2: Not only do they keep pushing the cruddy maps (Free Fall has been made universal, so it's coming up MUCH more often), but I seem to be getting host a lot now.  What happened to dedicated servers?!  The game has gotten so bad I'm only playing Squads now.  But even playing against bots is frustrating - they camp just as hard, but they have built-in aimbot and they appear to see through walls.  IW must really want us to buy the DLC for those small and medium maps as they keep pushing the large ones.  Well, no thanks - I'm speaking with my wallet and refusing to buy anymore from IW.  I'm going back to BLOPS2, along with thousands of others.  As of this morning, there were only 40K playing.  Dropping my star rating from 2 to 1.  It's that bad now.

UPDATE1: I don't know what Activision is doing, but they seem intent on pushing every one of their bad maps at me, over, and over, and over again.  Siege, Sovereign, Stonehaven, Chasm - it's a never ending repeat cycle. And there are so few players on - just today, it was 45K.  Worldwide.  So, finding a match without a large ping is hard to come by.  And it shows.  This game is absolutely no fun.  I'm dropping it from 3 to 2.

The graphics ARE better in the single and multiplayer modes.  However, in MP mode, I do find the extra shading and lighting effects to be distracting and makes it even harder to see the enemy - dark corner McDougal's are even darker!  And the beams of lights blind you - almost as bad as a flash bang.  More deaths that can be attributable to map design, yay.

I do notice much less stuttering/lost frames, thanks to the power of the PS4.  But lag compensation will always be with us.  Still too many deaths from invisible enemies.  At least the game is appropriately named - I often feel like I'm shooting at ghosts (bullets don't seem to hit at all) or being shot at by ghosts - bullets hitting me out of thin air.

So, this game is just slightly better in the PS4 version.  Is it worth the $10 upgrade if you have the PS3 version?  Sure, why not.  But it's still only a 3/5.","Marginally better than the PS3 version, but still BORING!"

B01APA8D2G,1.0,"I've been happily buying Corsair products for years without a complaint until this awful mouse.  This is a major avoid if you are looking for a cost effective gaming mouse from a top company.

The Good:
The cord is very high quality, button layout is fine, and the overall feel of the mouse is that of a sturdy build unlike some of the clunkier competitors out there.  Unfortunately thats where it ends.

The Bad:
It was one of the hardest mice I've ever seen to calibrate.  I've gotten consumer grade mice calibrated in seconds meanwhile I never got this mouse to my liking after several days.  The presets never worked well and I constantly had to change settings between games and general PC usage.
Because of the difficulties in getting calibration I found I actually had to lift this mouse more often than any other mouse which is something I dislike.
The colors were nice and match my Strafe keyboard but were way too bright on default settings and the mouse even got quite warm.

The Ugly:
Oh boy where to begin...
My mouse may have been defective but I experienced all kinds of functional problems.  At times left and right click would register a long hold so during FPS games I found my actions would carry on long after I let go of the button.  Conversely some clicks just never registered at all.  Also oddly I found the mouse didn't like swiping right a lot.  It would just lag even during normal PC usage.  I'm using Corsairs own mouse pad with it.
The sensitivity was never precise.  Fine adjustments to aim would cause significant jump in cursor movement even at low DPI settings.  Made it difficult to work with when precision is key.
The center mouse button was completely botched on my model.  It was stiffer than any mouse I've ever used.  There is a space in the body housing thats open between the two primary buttons so the wheel is kind of wedged in between them.  It felt like it was too tight and you really needed to crank the wheel to spin it.  Worse and most frustrating was that it wouldn't register spins an awful lot.  During games turning the wheel a single click would yield no action.  So sometimes I would have to spin another click.  Other times I would expect it and cycle past what I wanted.  Other times it would just register a click even when you didn't touch it.

I really cannot stress how disappointed I am with this mouse.  I know you get what you pay for but at $40 this is still more expensive than mid level consumer mice.  There were way too many problems with the mouse to continue using it.  Since I didn't install it until months after ordering I am disappointed I cannot return it.  In the trash it goes...  I wouldn't even recommend this mouse for an internet browser.",A MAJOR disappointment from Corsair...

B00EM5UFEK,1.0,"This game literally cannot be played at all, unless you pay extra for an Xbox Live Gold account.  Seriously.  You cant even play in single player mode without a Gold account.  There is also an ""always online"" requirement, you must be connected to the internet at ALL TIMES to play.  While I don't necessarily object to these requirements in theory, the problem is, the retail box DOES NOT MAKE THIS CLEAR ENOUGH!!  There are only 2 small boxes in the bottom left hand corner (lumped together with other misc ""boxes"") that mention this in small print.  Admittedly, it is there, but the print is so small that the average buyer isn't going to notice it when grabbing the game off the store shelf.  My young son (who was very excited to get this game) was very upset when we got home and the game refused to start without a Gold account.  It was only then that I took a very close look at the box and noticed the small print.  He was so upset that I went ahead and paid for a Gold membership so he could play.  I really felt like I got suckered into it.  I have owned the Xbox 360 since launch day almost 9 years ago, purchased countless retail games and have NEVER seen this type of requirement for a retail Xbox 360 game.

I've actually traded this game in, and was stupid enough to buy it once more after all of the patches were released.  The sad part is, I played it a bunch, in the hopes that I would eventually enjoy it, and ended up hating it even more now than I did before.  Almost every major aspect of the game that was broken before is still prevalent today.

1.  There is an enormous delay relating to taking incremental damage from gunfire.  In other words, everything from a pistol to a sniper rifle will pretty much drop you in one shot before you realize you were even taking fire.
2.  The most ridiculous spawn points in any game I've played.  You'll encounter everything from enemies spawning right behind you after you start running, to spawning 5 ft. away from enemies and practically spawning in the exact same spot, three times in a row.
3.  Screen stuttering from lag.  I've never actually seen something quite like it on a console game before.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but wow... it's pretty harsh.  Why make a game that's 60FPS when it's going to make it even harder to drop targets due to screen stuttering?
4.  Terrible weapon management UI.  It's definitely the most cluttered and horribly-navigable screens to sort through.  My sister could've put something together better than that!  Not to mention, players aren't allowed to modify their weapon loadouts until they join a match.
5.  Poor map design.  Obviously Hammerhead (no matter what game mode you play) gets 1st place for this, but when it comes Team Deathmatch and Squad Deathmatch, which were my favorite game modes in BF3, are now the worst game modes in BF4.  The selected locations in which DICE chose to use for each map is an absolute joke.  The maps are already extremely small, not to mention there are more players anyway, but they usually involve running around a building or two, instead of having the option to engage targets further away.  Forget about using DMRs or Snipers.
6.  It took quite a while to adjust various sensitivities within the game to achievement one that's fairly usable.  The reason why every player will end up doing so, is because the stock settings making it extremely hard to acquire targets from a distance.  Had they simply lowered the ADS sensitivity by %30, they would've never had to impliment that feature in the game.
7.  There are times when switching your current weapon will inadvertently switch back to your previous weapon.
8.  There are some staircases that are either wrongly placed on flat surfaces or the first two steps are not evenly spaced out, but at times I'll try rushing into a building and will get stuck in the doorway.  I noticed it the first day I was playing the newly remastered Operation Firestorm.  I remember chuckling when it happened.

Based on that and just all the other people an internet search will show have gotten the problem, makes it seem to me like a common problem. Basically if you see those lights there's something wrong with your system and you can't play it. Sure there is a 3yr warranty to fix it, from what I understand only for the 3 red lights. Only 1yr for the 2 red lights, supposed 'overheating' fault, which I eventually got during a 10min game session and continue to get every once in a while. Even still with the warranty you have to send your system in to get it repaired or replaced with a refurbished system, which takes about a month to get resolved.

B005WWZUQ0,1.0,"I got this game as part of a promotion and I have enjoyed BF and MW games for many years now but this game angered me so much that I'm officially not buying anymore EA products after I'm done with BF3. Why?

Jon Molle said it best and here's my experience:

- The game is fine but it's the installation and the required software that upset me the most.
> Accept EULA, install Origin, Re-accept EULA once again, finish installing origin
> Create Origin Account, sign-in ... okay fine. I would have rather to use Steam but whatever
> BF3 didn't install yet, I open up the game from the DVD drive and it goes through authentication and then boots up another origin client, it tells me that I'm signed on, on another computer. So i close both origin apps and re-launch the game.
> go through about 15 confirmation screens then install...
> Spend about 30 minutes installing 2-DVD's (that's normal)
> The game finishes the installation, but automatically updates.
> Click play anyways, so it sends me to the website
> Accept TOS once again, and subscribe to battlelog forcefully (in its own way)
> Have to install battlelog plugin for browser
> Restart browser, try to launch the game from battlelog, does nothing but wait until the game is updated (I just wanted to try campaign mode)
> Wait until 4gb of updates are done...
> While waiting look over promotional thing in the box for the gun club, go to the gunclub website to subscribe while waiting
> Origin server's are slow, downloading at about 700kb/s, I thought they were suppose to be faster than Steam? I average much higher than that on other sites.
> Finally I can play the game, game loads fine

> Play game, game looks funky with an HD 6950, not sure why...
> Load the game again, works fine, play the game -- everything seems OK. It took about 3-4 hours to install this game from DVD's thanks to Origin and other crapware.

There's so much crap involved with DRM and installation that it makes this game not worth getting legitimately. I thought that people were over-reacting to Origin and all that but it is what it is. Do not waste your time with it. BF3 is a fun game but ask yourself, is it worth wasting 4 hours installing all of this? I'm not buying any other EA game until they completely remove or make Origin and related applications optional. I didn't like EA before, now I really don't like them.

B00005ML10,1.0,"It's obvious from the opening sequence that a lot of effort went into this game.  The graphics and music are top notch.  Unfortunately, the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story.  It is, in essence, a horrible, horrible movie.
The Metal Gear franchise has never been known for believible plots, but MSG2 takes this to a whole new level.  Like always, there's a huge governmental conspiracy, this time engineered by people that supposedly died 500 years ago.  Riiiggghhht.
What's even more infuriating is the fact that MSG2 is really only a side-story.  Those of you looking forward to playing as Solid Snake again will be sorely disappointed.  Instead, his efemminate counterpart, Raiden, takes center stage.  He's the typical anime adrogenous hero, all pasty skin and long hair.  His story is not compelling in the least, and the setup to the climax is, in a word, stupid.  Anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the Metal Gear universe.
To make matters worse, all of the ""plot twists"" in the game merely serve to create un-needed confusion, and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict.  Otacon's story just reeks of a soap opera cliche.
The enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities, and are all portrayed as two-dimensional, melodramatic [fools].  They look neat and flashy, but never seem dangerous.  Instead, they seem rather comical, which eradicates any sense of true drama.  I know I'm not afraid of some guy that Rollerblades while placing bombs everywhere.
The voice acting is once again horrible.  Like in the previous game, emotion is handled via melodrama.  The voices range from growly to whiney, with no middle ground.  They neither endear me to the heroes, nor do they make me fear the villains.
Finally, there is the gameplay.  The gameplay, like in the original, is great.  Unfortunately, the game hardly lets you play.  The plot moves through a series of cutscenes.  You find out where to go, go there, see a cutscene of the enemy, kill the enemy, then watch another cutscene.  Repeat until you finish the game.
In a phrase, this game is not a game.  It's a horrible interactive movie.  Don't waste your money or your time.",This Metal Gear is not solid
B000WR42T6,1.0,"First thing that broke was the paddles. That required remapping those functions to the buttons on the wheel. The wheel is too small. This thing is a toy. If you're really into PC SIM racing, get a MoMo or better yet, a G27.",DO NOT BUY
B00W8FYF56,1.0,"I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, and I couldn't stand this game - So, no, being a fan of SW doesn't come with a certainty that you'll enjoy this game.  I even bought the limited edition Darth Vader PS4, but I traded Battlefront in within a few days with the certainty that more DLC (with the same gameplay) wasn't going to make me enjoy this more.

Pros:

+Beautiful looking game
+Sounds fantastic
Two points that everyone can agree with

Cons:
- Zooming in is useless.  The game is so fast paced that you're a sitting duck every time you zoom in, or crouch, or do anything else that has you planted in a stationary position.  Zooming in is also useless in the sense that you'll hit your target just as often firing from the hip, so why bother including the option?  If you take more than 5 seconds to line up a shot with the pulse rifle, chances are that you'll get killed before you have a chance to fire it, which makes it a weapon that rarely feels like it was meant for the maps in this game.

-Spawn points.  Again, the game is so fast paced that you often spawn with enemies already behind you, instantly putting you at a disadvantage mere seconds after you last died.  Players that do well in this game are ALWAYS on the move (even while shooting), so by the time that the 5 - 10 seconds have passed to respawn, you're already instantly getting shot at by the same enemy in a different location - There's rarely a moment where you'll think ""Well, I won't get shot at NOW"".  It just takes the wind out of any sense of strategy, or planning, when the pro tips to playing well are as simple as ""always be on the move, always shoot from the hip, and try not to push down on the R3 button (which is easy to press in the heat of the moment, and makes you a sitting duck in the middle of a gun battle)"".  On a side note, as far as I tried, there's no way to exchange the R3 Melee button for another without completely discombobulating the controls of how you're probably used to playing this type of game.  I would have loved the option to eliminate it entirely since there's never a moment that I'd rather melee someone than shoot at them.

-Maps/Map Design.  Well, there are only 4 if you want if you want the classic deathmatch.  A handful more if you venture out into other modes of play.  Oddly enough, none of it takes place in space, or in vistas that took place in the prequel trilogy.  I also can't make heads or tails of whether the maps are too big or too small.  In certain maps, I'd often get the sensation that I'm getting shot at from parts of the map that feel too far away to be seen from, let alone killed from.  ""Where the hell am I getting shot from?  Whoops, it doesn't matter because I'm already dead.  Did I really get shot from all the way over there?  How the hell did they see me?"".  These are thoughts that I had several times in a short amount of time, and it wasn't a sniper rifle that killed me either.

-Character Customization.  White Stormtrooper gear in the middle of a forrest?  Really?  Talk about being a giant bullseye in a sea of green.  I mean, 2 of the 4 deathmatch maps take place in environments dominated by forrest vistas, so it would have been nice to be able to camouflage myself at least as much as the rebels can in snow levels.  I'd find myself wanting to use Stormtroopers without helmets in the hopes that I'd get confused for a rebel.  There are also no choices in character classes, or character skills, as any character you choose performs the same function (soldier), and plays exactly like any other; which feels lazy, and ultimately plays boring when your only objective (and priority) is always to kill or be killed.  It's just disappointing that the only way you can ever turn the tide of a battle is by killing more than you're dying (and cross your fingers that everyone is else is doing the same).  That kind of simplicity was cool when online death matching was in it's infancy, but feels too repetitive and boring at this stage in the game; perpetuating the idea that this might be fun for someone who's never played an online death matching game before, but will bore anyone who's been playing around with more options for over a decade.

-No Voice Chat.  Well, unless you have friends with the game, and party chat with them; inadvertently giving them the advantage over everyone else that can't communicate, and plan, with each other.  Too often, it feels like everyone is lone wolf-ing it, and traveling in groups feels accidental (Well, I guess you're going the same way I'm going, but what's the plan?).  It just feels amazingly strange to buy a PS4, pop this game in, connect the headset, and realize that I can't communicate with anyone (Did I just buy a WiiU that looks like a PS4?).  Like every other online game I've played, I'd vastly prefer the option to mute people I don't care for if it means that I can exchange dialogue with those that are worthwhile to the experience.

-Speed of Play.  Again, it's too fast for the maps that the gameplay surrounds.  Play it slow and careful, and you're a sitting duck.  Speed up your play, and you're often in the middle of chaotic battles where players are blindly shooting (and throwing grenades) in the direction that they're getting shot from - Your shooting reticle gets obscured from your laser fire, so you don't even know if you're hitting your target most of the time.  There's rarely a sense of improvement as you'll perform well one game, and embarrass yourself the next, and back and forth until the whole thing feels like chaotic randomness.

I realize that there are players that ""get it"", and are consistently good at this game, but for the casual attitude that this game proposes, I don't think it does a very good job of inviting your average players to continue playing after the initial hype has worn off.  There just isn't really much to do in this game, and the competitive spirit of what makes these kind of games work simply feels shallow here. Take away the iconic SW imagery and sound, and you're left with a quality of game that you'd instantly see at a budget price.  Take away the SW license, and what you've got here is what feels like a $15 - $20 Map Pack of another game that had much more to offer at launch.",Yikes!
B00MYTSDU4,1.0,"Where did the quality go?  I'm a long time Razer user.  In fact I still have a Razor Boomslang first edition with a serial number of 000064.

B00ICWO1XA,1.0,"The game would be FANTASTIC, if it were not for these two fatal flaws:

1. You cannot beat the game without dying over and over and over again. This is one of those ""learn by dying"" games, where every time there's a new challenge, you die multiple times until you finally figure out how to beat the challenge. This ruins the immersion in the game.

2. You cannot complete a majority of the quests without looking online to find out how to complete them. Most of the quests have no map or guide to show you where to go, so unless you want to wander around aimlessly for hours and hours until you coincidentally happen to end up at the right place or talk to the right person, you're going to have to just look up online where to go/who to talk to.

B000R39GPA,1.0,"I'm a sucker for all things Star Wars, so I really wanted to love this game. I'd enjoyed Knights of the Old Republic and this was just going to be the same thing, only better, right? Nope.

This game is set in the Star Wars setting we all know and love, and the visual and audio effects for the lightsabers are fantastic, but the gameplay element of the game is absolutely atrocious. It's a bad game, with hideous camera and controls problems that suck all the fun out of playing. You spend more time wrestling the controls than you do slicing and dicing stormtroopers.

First off: targeting. Unbelievably, this game is worse at targeting than Zelda for the N64. Yes, it's that bad. You have no way to control what you are targeting other than facing towards it. No 'cycle through targets' button as is common in other games. This leads to the very common situation of you wanting to force grab or force choke an enemy right in front of you, but the game decides that really you wanted to pick up a box behind the stormtrooper on the complete opposite side of the room.

Dodging: Also worse than in Zelda. It's so bad that it's almost unmanageable. In order to dodge, you have to have an enemy targeted, much like Zelda. However, instead of simply 'locking on', you have to hold down R1 forever, as long as you want to have the enemy targeted. This quickly becomes unmanageable with the number of other buttons you have to hold down for lengths of time, such as R2 to grab. And you have to push the joystick, and L1, and still be holding R1 to dodge. Ridiculous.

And the game seems extremely sluggish and inconsistent in reacting to your commands. I had gotten used to the precision and speed with which the game reacted in Drake's Fortune or Assassin's creed. Here half the time, your 'double jump' command doesn't even execute the double jump. This is a shocking flaw, given that Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo 64 managed the double jump flawlessly.

The platforming sections of this game are atrocious. It would have been much better if they had been left out entirely. Prince of Persia this is not. It's not even Drake's Fortune. It's just a clumsy, inelegant, imprecise mess. You can't have a platforming game without ledge grab, yet this is precisely what this game does. There are far too many 'one way slippery ledge to death' situations. Remember the sands of time in Prince of Persia which let you rewind? Yep, no such thing here. Instead, you get to start over at the nearest checkpoint. And it's usually not obvious which ledge you can safely land on and which one you cannot before you leap. Terrible design flaw. Especially given the fact just the merest nudge sends the character plummeting off to one side...in fact, just the forward momentum of executing lightsaber combos can send him hurtling off the edge. This is a terrible design decision. If you use attacks and get to close to the ledge in real platforming games, the character grabs on and doesn't fall. The platforming here is as bad as it was in the original 2D Prince of Persia, and that's saying a lot. The designers wanted to get cute with making you use your force powers to lower ledges you could jump onto, but the whole thing is terrible.

It's not made any better by the camera. They're trying to provide a nice cinematic experience, by zooming the camera out and putting it in a fixed position in many key scenes. Sometimes it works great. More often, it's an absolute mess. Frequently you cannot see your character at all, being hidden behind a protrusion or even by the body of the person you are fighting. It's like the tested half the fights to get the right camera angles and just made poor guesses for the other half. Having a triple A title like this with camera issues where you literally can't even see your character is unforgivable. The inability to easily see what is around you is also bad given the area of effect attacks several monsters launch, where a spot on the ground begins to glow and if you are standing near it after a set amount of time, it explodes and you take damage. It's entirely possible to be near enough one of these spots to be hit, but it doesn't show up in your field of vision. Indeed, the game seems to take delight in arranging the camera angle so this occurs.

Oh, and that leads us to another unforgivable omission, one I thought the games design industry had long ago accepted as standard (but Force Unleashed is a step back in so many ways). You cannot skip cutscenes. This is abominable, especially given how many cutscenes there are, often some right before a tricky platforming session or boss battle you must watch over and over again each time. The cutscenes are visually impressive, but I don't want to have to watch them half a dozen times. Speaking of cutscene failures, there are cases where a cutscene is split. There's a custcene, then you can control your character for a half second, including taking damage from foes, then it goes right back to the continuation of the cutscene. I can't believe this is intended, and it's a rather glaring flaw.

But the biggest flaw in the entire game is the abomination of Raxus Prime. This is literally one of the 5 worst levels I have ever played. The color palette is painful to the eyes, and the level design is insipid and uninspired. Raxus Prime is supposed to be the 'junk pile' world, so there' just random heaps of black and yellow debris everywhere, funneling you down a narrow linear path. The colors are atrocious, it looks like someone vomited over a pile of chewed up legos. Everything is just a kaledeiscope of yellow and black, near objects, distant objects, ledges you can hold onto, ledges that just send you to your death...there's no real discrimination or attempt to draw a visual contrast between important elements and the background. Moreover, this level is home to one of the absolute no-nos of gaming...a mini-boss battle without a save point afterwards. Combined with the aforementioned terrible platforming, compounded by the uniform black and yellow vomit pattern of Raxus Prime, it means you may have to repeat a boss battle two or even three times if the game's jumping engine betrays you.

Even navigating the menus is an exercise in tedium and frustration. Each and every click you make takes you to another 'loading' screen before the submenu shows up. I've never seen this before and it really slows things down and breaks up the flow of play.

In short, this game is a major, major disappointment. The visuals (aside from Raxus Prime) are superb, the soundtrack, blaster sounds, lightsaber hum, are all terrific. But the gameplay is severely lacking almost across the board. If, like me, you loved KOTOR and are looking for more of the same, don't bother. Watch the movies again instead. Or find a friend who has played the game already and get him to show you the unlocked cinematics. Don't waste your money or time on this one.","Beyond the hype and beloved franchise, terrible gameplay leads to a disapointment"

B00178630A,1.0,"This review is strictly for the Digital Rights Management portion of the game that requires you to ALWAYS have an internet connection to play even SINGLE PLAYER.  I have always been a big fan of Diablo.  I have had two copies of this game on pre-order for over a year.  Just before going to get them, I started reading the stories of the servers crashing and players becoming frustrated because they could not play single player.  Looking further into it, I saw that it was because Blizzard, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER in a Diablo game, requires you to ALWAYS be connected to their servers in order to play.

This means that if the server is down, you can't play.  If you don't have an internet connection, you can't play.  If they ever decide to shut down the servers, you can't play ever again.  You have a $60 piece of software that is useless.

I cancelled my pre-orders and refuse to ever purchase this or any other game (that isn't an MMO) that has this kind of DRM.  I really wish everyone would take a stand against this.  It doesn't matter how awesome a game may be, if you can't play it, what good is it?","If always on DRM is the future, I'm an ex-gamer"
B00FQPQM42,1.0,"As with the base game, the expansion is just as disappointing. Map size is still painfully small, and it's very difficult and mind numbingly boring to have to manage every little financial aspect of your city just to stay in the green for a few hours. I'm not sure if the megatowers are bugged or what, but the demand doesn't seem to work the way it should and residents complain constantly and move out no matter how well your city is managed. Reminiscent of how the casinos behaved before.

The futurizing is kinda cool, but it's just a sparkly overlay without a whole lot of value. For example, I still rarely use maglevs as the just aren't as useful or as good a value as streetcars.

B0055A7SUK,1.0,"Paying to play with Bots, Hackers, and Idiots. If I had to sum up my WoT gameplay experience that would be it.

I played up to Tier 9 (10 total tiers). I spent a lot of time on this game before I gave up. Here is my final review of the game:

No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the next patch. Particular vehicles, classes, maps, whatever.

Don't even think about building up your arty. They nerf it over and over and over. If you were unfortunate enough to have rolled arty a few years ago then you pretty much lost all that progress as they took every single ounce of fun out of arty. What they do is change the game mechanics to your shot has a lesser chance of hitting, then they slow your reload and increase the time it takes to aim. You can literally do your homework while waiting for arty to reload.

Getting a good tank is a matter of luck. You might spend months playing a particular research line (as it takes that long) only to find out that there is a TERRIBLE tank in that line. One that will take months upon months of playing a tank you hate. You have three choices at this point 1) play another tank then pay (a lot: $20+) to convert your experience, 2) play through it. 3) Start another line from scratch. World of Tanks knows you'll eventually just get frustrated and pay your way through. WoT also uses patches to change the stats on vehicles. You might find a tank you really like but they change it so you will want to play something else. They absolutely do this on purpose. Why? To keep you moving up lines and buying gold to skip almost unplayable tanks.

The game is built to encourage people to buy gold. The model works for sure. But, if you aren't one of those people thats going to put money into every single round then don't expect to do very well. If you don't have a premium tank you don't make as much silver (money), don't get as good of match making (who you fight against) and your crew increases in experience slower. Pretty much, you can grind for months and get now where.

Micro-transactions are a huge part of this game. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you aren't will to pay and pay often. It isn't cheap. I have probably spent over $150 on this game so far. Now that I'm not spending more money on it the enjoyment level went WAY down.

Edit: for those of you who think you'll get to T10 then just play that, you're wrong. Those tanks lose money on average, so you're forced to play lower tiers (which only make a small amount of money), buy and exchange gold, or buy a premium tank.",No matter what you like about this game they will change it in the ...

B000P297EI,1.0,"Kind: Action Adventure
Difficulty Level: Mom
Replay-ability: Low
Pacing: Boring
Audience: NooBs

Why:
You enjoyed the heck outta DMC 2 and DMC 3, need more of the same, and dig the fashion designs.

Why not:
It's a slow, repetitive, uninspired ""button-masher"" as my friend would say (a game where you triumph not by skillful maneuvers or clever strategy, but by simply punching the attach button allot). The first DMC was a masterpiece of dark, creepy, Gothic horror with heart-pounding action and white-knuckle tension. It was fun to play and cool to watch. It was very empowering.
The second DMC was worthless but the third was somewhat OK. And again, in this fourth one, you just just run around what looks like a European tourist village and shoot/chop seemingly endless legions of monsters that aren't in the least intimidating (rag dolls and marionettes) that just pop up out of the floor until the game decides you've killed enough and lets you continue to the next mindless melee.
DMC 4 has none of the edge of the first and third. It's like it's trying to be it's own game, which is not why we buy it.
The movement is unnatural and the camera is maddening.
The story is uninteresting.
The sound effects are stock.
The objectives are all too often unclear.
It fails to make use of a fraction of the PS3's awesome power. It looks like a PS2 game.

Notes:
After a week, both my son and I gave up on it, dusted off the PS2 and played 1 and 3 again.

Half-finished game that misses the point of DMC completely.",Buyer Will Cry

B01ENZU6J2,1.0,"So yeah, the cover shooting is fine/fun, but this is one shameless cash-grab... With somehow WORSE graphics than Ultimate.

Be wary, some spoilers below so read on at your own discretion.

The campaign is a pretty big disappoint to say the least. Yes, the combat is solid (as Gears has always been) and it thankfully went back to the old control scheme instead of Judgment's butchery of it. However, while the action is once again entertaining, plot-wise, it's a travesty of storytelling with large amounts of holes, questions that the developers don't even bother answering (let alone attempting to give hints on) and imperative plot points for understanding the new Sera, new characters and The Swarm that are completely swept under the rug. Of course, the reasoning behind this is that The Coalition doesn't want to tell a great narrative now; they want to franchise it for as long as possible and come up with resolutions as they're allowed to make sequels. Guys, a constant slew of unaddressed questions is not a story and a cliffhanger is not an ending (it should only be part of). And speaking of the ""ending""; it's terrible. It feels like the game is just getting started (especially when you consider where the finale takes place) and then, after a 2-3 minute cutscene, it cuts to black with next to nothing having been accomplished and learned. There's not even a main villain or anything (the guy it sets up to be a primary foe is dispatched earlier on and doesn't even have a name in the game) What's even more shameless is that, to get information on the narrative (beyond, you know, the damn game), you have to go online to something like Wiki as the game doesn't even do its job of informing you. For anything more, you have to wait another decade (for two more games plus DLC) to just understand base information that they should have been telling you now like:

-Why does JD hate Marcus and why did he seemingly abandon him? (of course, we could infer, but tell us what happened!)
-Why does JD hate Baird?
-What happened to Anya and how did she die?
-What is Jinn's motive and why does she just disappear during the last act?
-Why do JD and the outsiders hate Jinn and their seemingly peaceful society, but still want to loot and attack their settlements?
-Why in the world would Reyna's mom lock she, JD and Del in a shed when The Swarm attack AFTER she just had you save the ENTIRE village from a DeeBee attack? These are your best proven fighters! (Okay, so that was just really bad writing/a plot hole, but still).
-How can the Swarm hack robots with quills? And if they can, why aren't they hacking the DeeBees later in the game instead of fighting them? Seems like a waste of a randomly-generated enemy trait.

These are just a minimal amount of major plot threads that are just shrugged off in favor of further franchising, like Halo 5. And no, to everyone gibbering away that they're just setting up for the DLC and sequel and yadd-yadda-yadda----NO. This is flat-out bad writing and bad storytelling. Give us something!

The Swarm are also kinda just dumb. They don't look interesting, hardly have any diversity and the ""Scions"" just look nonthreatening with their too-dimwitted/human faces. There's potential for them, but the game gives no depth to them or their purpose other than harvesting.

The characters are also grating. JD is alright, but the ""humorous"" dialogue is near non-stop and most of it is the trio not taking anything seriously, making jokes and speaking solely in sarcasm. Yes, the original games had this, but in this one, it's so incessant and so cringe-worthy that it's just obnoxious. There's simply a time and place for everything and this one has these infants copping jokes around a mutilated body they just discovered. That and they act like brats and treat Marcus and Baird like crap. Reyna even has the audacity to speak down to Marcus at one scene where all he's trying to do is talk sense.

Multiplayer is alright but it doesn't 'feel' like Gears of War combat. It feels like a Call of Duty interpretation. Again, it does Gears' gameplay, but in a Call of Duty-esque way. Now, everything's about loadouts, temporary cards you can equip and ""zombie"" characters (like COD) that look pretty stupid. I really liked unlocking the character models in old Gears games and the ones in this are just lazy (color-splattered? Seriously? Gimme a Theron, please). Worse, multiplayer is utterly mutilated with micro-transactions. There are seriously 3 forms of currency and getting credits isn't a grind, it's an absolute slog. Worse, when you actually get enough credits to buy one of the packs, it's completely random whether or not you'll receive anything worthwhile. 99% of the time, you receive the lamest gun skins or experience cards--and even doubles at that in the SAME PACK! Even worse (yup, it does get worse) I now have doubles (and even one TRIPLE) of cards that the game won't let me ""scrap"" for currency to buy another skin instead. Now, I have decks of cards that are literally unusable. It's revolting, it's disgusting and it's even gambling. They literally force you to gamble on stupid slots. Funny, considering all those gamers who got busted on COD for gambling because they were actually EARNING money by playing--and the ol' government came down on them for. BUT NO, it's totally okay for AAA game companies to extort and pocket money if they're the ones forcing gamers to gamble. Insane. Also, the season pass was utterly worthless as it doesn't come with ANYTHING that would/should come in a season pass. Oh, the new characters/Run the Jewels box or the MLG loot box??? NOPE! Gotta pay extra even though you already shelled out $100 (not that I care for the character models, but still, it's principle). Of the loot I got with the $100 edition, I got nothing worthwhile but several ""pine"" skins for guns that look as stupid as they sound. So what do you get with this edition? Kinda-sorta early access (one week before they're released for free) to multiplayer maps that can only be played on the developer mode.

As for guns, the DeeBee weapons are actually the most fun (the Overkill and Embar). However, most of the time, I just used the original lineup of guns as I feel they're more effective. The Dropshot is annoying as it sometimes works really well and sometimes explodes directly next to someone and does... Nothing. The Buzzkill is stupid fun, but like the Dropshot I never bothered to use it beyond its introductory use (as it's slow to start firing and needs to be used from a static position). The Markza is okay, but when you already have a sniper and lancer/hammerburst, it's kinda void.

Music is also severely lacking when it should be used during cutscenes. One ""emotional"" moment is rendered ""meh"" by the complete lack of a sympathetic song (think The Coalition trying to replicate the Maria scene from Gears 2 but without memorable music and/or emotional investment from the player--as again--it's taken no time to explain why we should care about these new characters).

As a fanatic of all things Gears (except that crap one Judgment), I find Gears 4 to be decent mindless fun, but a slap in the face as well for those who have supported the series. It's clear the people involved (and still are from previous games) needed Cliffy B. to guide them and really don't understand their fan base nor what makes a game great. It's a AAA title all the way in that it's a microtransaction-filled cash-grab made for the general public first and fans secondly.","Shameless. Thanks, Coalition... DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION."
B004U9T6FM,1.0,"You've got your basic mega man style game thrust into a mortal kobat situation. Great it's fun to play you bash the bad guys till your heart's content.

You spend 85% of the game trying to hit the ball (which you rarely do) and the other 15% watching your own ai score goals for the other team.  I went 33-4 in rookie season....i then moved up to Pro level and have never won more than 10 games in a season.  Suddenly the AI goes from not goal tending and no scoring to, all three AI DEFENDING the goal and all three AI opponents scoring at will.

B00005YDCZ,1.0,"This game's a pile garbage!  The developers claimed that they wanted to create a game that lived up to the true innovation of real-life backyard wrestling.  Well if this game's any indication of what backyard wrestling's really like, forget it.  I rented this game the other day from my local video store.  After playing about 5 minutes horrendous gameplay, I soon felt that I was ripped off out of the money I paid to rent this garbage (thank goodness for rentals).  Here are some major downfalls of BW:
The character models are poor.
When characters talk, the mouths don't even move.
Computer AI is extremely cheap.
Computer has almost 99% perfect accuracy when picking up & throwing weapons from a distance at you, they almost never miss.
Create-Character-Mode is cheap beyond cheapness.
Replay value isn't great (after unlocking all the characters after one sitting, what's the point?).
Especially creating characters.  The worst part of the game.  Fans of WWE Create-a-character modes will be woefully disappointed.  The player can't even create a character from scratch, all they can do is select a pre-made character and mobilize their stats and fighting style.  You can't even develope the character's costume.  All you do is choose a costume that has already been made (imagine playing a fighting game as your favorite character and choosing a different costume for them to fight in, that's technically all you can do).  There aren't even many move to choose from for your character.  Yes the game does have it's strong points such as taking full advantage of the X-box's custom soundtracks system, and there are some nice videos to watch in the media room (some of which have to be unlocked).  However, is it really worth playing through, just for videos?  What's worst is that the game doesn't even play like a wrestling game.  It plays more so of that as a button-mashing fightng game.  Take it from me, there are plenty of better wrestling games out there (I really feel for those who poured out their fifty bucks of hard earned cash on this title).

Anyway I set this game at what I usually have games set at. And it was studder city. I noticed many other people have had this problem also. So in other words it was very poorly put together. After messing around with the video settings I got it to run decent. Then I felt my efforts were wasted after playing the game. It is SOOOOOOOO HIGHLY OVERRATED. I've played many other better fps's than this. All you really do is wonder aimlessly and blast away everything you see. Thats about it. No varity. And the muti-player REALLY sucks. This game is like many other Microsoft games, Good GFX and Poor Gameplay.

B00BGA9Y3W,1.0,"Oh man... how I wanted to love this game. All the hype built up by the big gaming sites and the amazing live action commercial that should be made into a movie all by itself had me anxious to get into this game... But it's let me down in a big way.

I'm bored. Plain and simple, the game is boring.

PVP, boring and broken. Just make a hunter and win all the matches. PVP is broken, lots of things wrong. So aside from doing the same thing over and over for not much reward, you're basically playing the same stale poorly designed maps over and over... Add to that broken mechanics and an unbalanced class system, you've got a recipe for frustration.

 PVE - boring. Made a warlock and killed everything... On the 4th or so mission to Russia, I started noticing the exact same metal container was the same one I had crouched behind for cover in the previous missions. Why are the developers so lazy that the map has to be the same place for every mission? And open world? That's laughable. There is NO open world environment to speak of in this game. Add to that repetitiveness and huge time sink in an effort to upgrade gear, which you hardly ever get, you've got a terribly implemented idea that could have been so much more.

Aside from all that no story. NONE! Additionally, the little guy from game of thrones is just a terrible voice actor. Hell, Seth McFarland doing Brian Griffin as ghost woulda been more enjoyable to listen to than this guy read his monotonous script.

I saw a review that stated the live action commercial had more character development and dialogue than the entire game, and they were spot on!

I'm seriously sad that Destiny didn't turn out like I expected. I've played games that grabbed me from the beginning with a good story and made me care about the character I'm playing and this is far from that level, by a million miles...

Update: I hate wasting money, so I've given it another couple weeks. The two stars just went down to one. Not even amazing graphics and fluid gameplay can make up for this lack of substance.  I refuse to buy into the DLC will make it better mentality. I've been burned once already by bungie, why get fooled again? I won't waste another cent on them or this terrible game.

I must say, in regards to the 200+ good reviews out there, they absolutely have to be suffering from denial. I can identify, they are the ones who've made it to level 25+ most likely, and spent so much time grinding this game and perhaps have some seriously good items to show for it. So they are holding on, feigning loyalty, but they know... They know as well as you or I do, that this title absolutely sucks.

B000H5U5DK,1.0,"If you own it...

The word ""scourge"" means to punish, chastise, or criticize severely, something you should be doing to yourselves if you picked up this game.

Scurge: Hive by SouthPeak Interactive did well to fly this under the radar. Much like Etrian Odyssey and other unhyped games, it just landed on the shelves of video game retailers everywhere one day. And one fateful day, I walked into EB Games and saw Scurge, and I had never heard of it before. So instinctively, I bought it. Plus, the cover had a nice yellowish-orangeish hue to it, and it looked sort of nice.

What a disappointment this was. I hate myself for spending the retail $29.99 on its release to purchase this abomination of a game. Maybe it's my critical side speaking, because the other two reviewers had pleasant things to say about the game.

The graphics are Super Nintendo at best, and I think SNES RPGs fared better in many situations. The gameplay is downright horrible, the functions are extremely clumsy, and you're stuck with a pathetic excuse for a gun that shoots little orb-like blips to kill enemies. I lasted a whole 30 minutes on the game before I started thinking about a possible way to repackage the item so I could return it for a full refund.

I always conclude my reviews with an analysis of the price of the game and what it has to do with its overall value. My purpose is to inform you whether or not I think the game is worth the price it's set at. It is for you to decide whether or not you agree with me, and for the review to be a determining factor in your hesitation to pick it up or not.

And so the price should say something about the game. After its intial $29.99 public release, it quickly fell to a meager $17.99 at EB Games / GameStops (I go to EB a lot if you didn't notice), then fell further to an unheard of $9.99. Brand Spankin New. Not used. BRAND NEW.

Ping Pals didn't even hit that low. You could pick up a brand new copy of Ping Pals for a measly $14.99. $9.99? And let me tell you, it's not even worth it at that. It should be given out for free, and even then, I don't think you should take it.

Maybe I'm being overly harsh, but it's because I paid more than 30 bucks for it and I'll hate myself forever for that.",PURGE your LIVEs of this game...

Wow, I wasn't really expecting this to happen... picked up the tin box special edition from my local gamestop, ran home to install, and get things going.

First few mintues were an immediate disbelief that I may have wasted $70 on the special edition (though the goodies that came with the special edition are kinda neat).

The graphics immediately looked sub-par, the voice acting was shabby, and the gameplay was just god awful.

I said ""no biggie, cant wait to get into the wastelands""

After what seemed like a 25 minute waste of time, and a really poor intro, i finally made it out of vault 101.

I looked, expecting a breath taking surreal post-nuclear war enviornment in brillant detail.

I was so horribly wrong.

While the character models are strong, the rest of the environment looked a tad bit less graphical than STALKER. And STALKER graphics weren't even that impressive.

And on top of it all, after attempting to adjust to the control scheme, it just felt ""lost"" and kinda spread out all over in all sorts of annoying and inconvienent menus.

Even VAT was pretty pathetic, and doesn't add much interest into a game that as if it was a familiuar feeling of something I've allready played in Chernobyl, with less than average animations, graphics, story, etc.

Another problem the game has is that it cant quite seem to choose what it wants to be.... a 1st person shooter, 3rd person shooter, or a RPG. While the idea of the mix is intriguing, it just doesn't work out well in the game, and is poorly implemented.

I don't understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong with this game. More importantly, I have no idea how this game is getting the reviews it's gained, other than maybe the magazines were just desperate for some under-the-table payoff.

Your money would be far better spent on Farcry 2, Dead Space, or STALKER Clear Sky at this point.

And this was playing it on a ultra-high end gaming rig.

The Manhatten Project retains some of the feel of the previous Duke games but is not up to par with its ancestors.  The biggest complaint I have is with the user interface.  It is nearly impossible to control the on-screen character with either keyboard commands or the joystick.  Also, the horizontal only movement and the third person perspective does not work well with a shoot-em-up such as this.  I like the graphics and the game concept but control is of paramount importance in a shooter and this game just does not have it.",Very Disappointing

B00005NCB5,1.0,"Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is a very bad first-person shooter. You can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with BOTS. I played offline, but I doubt that it makes much of a difference since SOF has many technical problems.
This game is barely worth my time. Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 should have been beta tested, so it would not turn out this bad. This is simply of one the worst games currently out for the PS2. It is an insult to the pc version of Soldier of Fortune. The pc version had clean graphics, fast framerate and great sound effects. The PS2 version has none of those things. My biggest gripe about this version is the very crappy frame rate, it is pathetically bad! It has some of the worst graphics to date on the PS2! You'll see this strange folding effect on the screen; as if someone is tugging at it, because the graphics cannot keep up with the action on screen.
Not only does it look horrible but the choppy frame rate will also affect your game play. If someone is shooting at you from the upper level and you want to aim your cross- hairs up, it takes a couple of seconds too long and then you are either dead or the enemy gets away. The aiming controls can barely catch up to the target in time and this is very frustrating.
Just imagine an internet game with tons of ""LAG"", and then you'll understand what I mean. The graphics and colors look muddy and drab (even the SNES games look better). Animation is jerky and the characters look strange when they run around shooting. SOF also had clipping problems; in some areas I spotted enemies because their arms or legs where showing through walls. Loading the game takes forever! You can go have a cup of coffee and it will still be on the loading screen! Then when SOF finally loads you'll be treated to every bad thing that a PS2 game can have wrong.
The one good thing about the graphics was that it was able to keep the blood and gore from the pc version- you can still blow people's heads, arms and legs off. And I liked the fact that they included BOTS in multiplayer and you can play against them by yourself. Are the BOTS any good you ask? Well they have a tendancy to shoot you in the back very often and they seem to have better shooting accuracy than you, but they don't have any real strategy. They basically run and shoot a lot mindlessly. But the action is never exciting because of all the ""LAG"".
The frame rate is laughably bad (like a bad joke). Playing Single player is even less fun and I got ticked off by one of the levels where you ride on a moving train. My character got stuck in the railing a couple of times and the enemy cpu got me with a lot of cheap shots. I found a few other places where my character got stuck to a door and the enemy came and blew me away. That's just bad programming. If they had done a better job of beta testing SOF, this would not happen. The controlling is not bad but it needed to be more responsive (especially when aiming!)
The sound of effects are weak and unrealistic. The sound of gun fire from each weapon is very inaccurate and sound cheap. The Shotgun sound is too loud for its own good. Grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire. However, the music is pretty good as are the screams from enemies when you blow them away.
In conclusion SOF is plagued by everything that could go wrong in a game of this type and you are better off buying something else. I feel sorry for the people that buy this game and then they can't get their money back. So I hope they listen to me when I say this: Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is total junk. I suggest many other first person shooter games that are much better and enjoyable than SOF. Games like: ""Timesplitters 1 and 2"", ""Medal of Honor"", ""Red Faction 1 and 2"" ""James Bond Nightfire"". Those games will leave Soldier of Fortune in the dust bin- where it rightfully belongs!",Soldier of Sorry
B001CBW18U,1.0,"NB: For those of you who love RPGs, this is DEFINITELY NOT an action rpg, so please, don't be fooled. This is a substandard ""God Of War"" clone with only the thinnest spreading of charm to recommend it.

Boasting a paper-thin plot (wife killed, quest begun, allies recruited, baddies defeated - it is literally that linear) and a mawkish, awkward interface (there is no minimap and the secondary powers HUD is deeply unresponsive), ""Rise Of The Argonauts"" could have been so, so good, but lets both itself and you badly down in all categories that make a videogame great.

GRAPHICS: 0/5

The PS2 could handle this game, and do it without all the (inexplicable) slowdown. Disgusting character modeling and texturing (witness Atalanta's ""floating arms"" syndrome, sharp edges and  abominable pixellation of EVERYTHING up-close) are matched only by the uninspired lighting, insipid backgrounds and frankly ridiculous level design. This game is UGLY with a capital UG, and does not belong on current-gen consoles.

SOUND: 1/5

Poor voice acting is not helped by a time delay after each sentence is completed, and the much-touted score by Tyler Bates is castrated by some serious over-use (the repetition rate of the pieces of music played while accessing the Aspect screen, and during a State Of Grace period, is actually ridiculous - try not to be infuriated by it. You will not succeed). The nicest thing one can say about the aural atmosphere in ""Rise Of The Argonauts"" is that it's slightly better than having hardware issues with the sound chip in your PS3.

PLAYABILITY: 1/5

You run to one end of a convoluted jungle, witness a cutscene, then access two menu screens to see your map with updated objectives, only to be shown that you need to run all the way back to the beginning of the area... ...to repeat the same process again.

If that last sentence was hard to read, imagine how hard it is to stay engaged with the game it's describing.

""Rise Of The Argonauts"" could have saved itself in this regard if Codemasters had bothered to create a fluid battle system we could enjoy using, but no: it's witless hack-n'-slash action requiring no attention to detail that gets boring after five minutes: luckily, the game is incredibly easy, too, so it won't be long before you're dispatching the game's final boss and you get to put the disc back into its box, and play something decent instead.

Greek myths are cool - the legend of Jason and the story of the Golden Fleece doubly so, and in one or two tiny areas ""Rise Of The Argonauts"" does manage to dredge up a little mythological charm, most notably around the island of Kythra. But pretty soon you'll forget this, as you're off to the Underworld to fight more glowing green baddies with projectile powers. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.

OVERALL: 0/5

Epic, this is not. Epic Fail... ...well, yeah. I am at a total loss to understand why people like this game. For my money, it's technically redundant, unplayable and completely unoriginal.

You're far better off buying the God Of War games and a cheap PS2, if you really need an action-driven story-based game set in Ancient Greece. ""Rise Of The Argonauts"" is absolutely terrible.

B000VL4J9Q,1.0,"As far as I can tell, as of 11/23/09, this game seems to be dropping off significantly in terms of population, at least on my server.  Personally, I credit this to inability or unwillingness on the part of the game developers/operators (NCWest) to

  1. Balance the two races such that meaningful PvP can occur.  As it stands now, being an Asmodian is a constant series of losing battles where you are outnumbered at least 2 to 1.  I would imagine that some might enjoy being on the other side (the Elyos) and slaughtering other players with no effort, but such is not for me.

  2. Bots (characters controlled by software, with no one actually at the keyboard) are rampant, almost completely uncontrolled by GM's (Game Masters), simply because there is very little GM presence in the game.  I suspect that since GM's need to be paid at least some salary, their numbers are kept low.

  3. Kinah (game money) sellers (usually closely aligned with bots) not only broadcast in the chat channels, and send you private messages, they camp right in front of the brokers.  Again, GM enforcement of the rules against this is almost nil, which causes any respect for the other rules (Terms of Service) to evaporate.

  4. The logic for gaining XP (Experience Points, which drive the advancement of your character) is such that, at least in the general player opinion, grouping with other players is actually detrimental.  Almost everyone solos.  Expect a lonely first few weeks of play, until you have achieved the crucial level 25, at which point grouping becomes more necessary to survival.

  5. Last, but not least, the chat channels (especially the critical LFG (Looking For Group)) have been taken over, generally, as a teen chat channel, full of obscenities, racism, anti-semitism, and references to illicit substances and adult activities.  Yet again, no GM oversight.  I have encountered some mature, reasonable people in groups, but not many.  I do not recommend that parents permit children under 18 to play this game.

Anyways, heres the problems.
-Cannot change the class of character, any weapon you find that aren't dual sabers cannot be equipped ever.
-The dungeons are repetitive. They use the same terrains and pots and dead bodies and stuff.
-Trading system boring, its basically the only interaction you need.
-People say the same thing constantly.
-In total, this game has 64 characters i believe. All together, civilians and players. I got the ryu book and it told me. I honestly don't know how boring it can get then 64 characters.(like 12 of them being playable)
-Boring plot, your friend goes in a coma, some chick is running around, and the game doesn't have any plot.
-In order to mooch as much money as possible from the game, Bandai decided to release FOUR, F-O-U-R Games. For FIFTY dollars each. Meaning this series requires 200 bucks to be completed. Considered the first one took me 15 hours basically, Bandai could of easily fit in more, instead they want more and more money. Basically this means the game isn't even a full game.

Quick advice : STAY AWAY!

Really cheap quality, I bought this mouse 3/8/16 and I loved it, everything worked perfectly, the shape is great, ergonomics are great, flashy colors, good grip... And right after the 1st month of NORMAL USE! (average 30hrs in 2 weeks of CSGO, and regular browsing), the left click broke! It started with being harder to click, and a day later it just broke. I have been reading online and this is fairly a common issue for a lot of people, which disappoints me to no end. I refuse to throw $60 down the drain so all I can do is RMA from Razer and wait for the next one to break as well within 1-2 months. I will never again buy ANY Razer product.
Also need to mention that the retailer that sold this mouse to me was PROELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTING. Which I would also recommend STAY AWAY FROM THEM! Awful costumer service.

If everything you've just read didn't deter you from buying this cheap s**t, and you want to give it a try (lol), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying it from a reputable computer store (ex: MicroCenter) that will assist you after it breaks no matter what time-frame.

The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.
The ring menu system from ""The Secret of Mana"" was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  ""Sword of Mana"" has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.
Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.
I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown & Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.

B00UJ9LB6Y,1.0,"I have owned my N3ds since around when they were first released. I remember looking on amazon and google for a case and seeing this one and the negative reviews and avoiding it. Throughout the years I kept thinking of getting a case but for some reason it seems that nobody makes a protective case that would protect against drops. So, now that my son is 3 and has started taking interest in playing Mario I needed a case or else I would not have a 3ds for much longer. This definitely will protect your 3ds from drops, but it has too many flaws.
Pros: Will protect from drops, ergonomic.
Cons:
1) No slot for game cart(not huge deal).
2) Biggest flaw to me is how the right and left shoulder buttons get stuck a lot, makes certain games unplayable with this on. Also, I like my things to last a long time and I am sure that constantly having the shoulder buttons forced down for hours on end is not good for longevity.
3) Material is a bit flimsy and thin in certain place such as around the hinges. A couple reviews speak about it tearing around there, I definitely foresee this happening soon.
Since there is little (no?) competition in foam-like cases for the N3ds it seems that this company is not even trying to improve the design, they are just raking in the cash with countless people asking for a couple simple design fixes (how hard is it to cut out a game cart slot at production?). As I stated this is the only case I have seen of its kind for years now, so sadly I am going to keep it and try to cut out the shoulder buttons.

The first version I bought starting having problems about 2 weeks after buying it.  It would make this really annoying grinding noise.  I would have to keep hitting the fan until it would stop.  The newer version I also bought and had the same problem.  The new version is better though.  It lasted me 3 weeks instead of 2.  Real Impressive.

B00IG3GPTS,1.0,"Update 1/6/2016
You can probably tell by the review below that I really liked this keyboard. It felt great to type on and looked pretty nice. However, after just over three years it's now in the garbage because the ""A"" key stopped working entirely and Razer only warranties their keyboards for 1 year. This is a $140 mechanical keyboard. You spend the excess $$$ on these things because they're supposed to not only type well, but outlast a normal keyboard. It felt great and I really enjoyed it for my first few years of using it, but purchase at your own risk. If you don't mind replacing your keyboard every few years at $120-140 a board then this is a great option. However, if you're looking at getting a keyboard that will last then this is probably not a great option.

One thing to note: I have seen that a number of manufactures only warranty their keyboards for between 1-3 years regardless of what types of switches they have (even rubber vs mechanical). It was something that I looked into when looking for a replacement. Kind of a disappointing thing to see considering that not all keyboards are created equally, but it's good to take into account if you're looking at getting one.

Original Review: I've had this keyboard for two years now, so I feel like I can finally write a review about it's durability and lasting appeal. To put it simply, this keyboard is awesome. I'm an MBA student and a gamer, so this guy sees A LOT of use. Here's a list of pros and cons from a person that's put this keyboard through the ringer:

Pros:
* Tactile feel - I learned to type in my teenage years by playing starcraft and chatting while trying to micro manage everything on my screen. This is to say, I have gotten ridiculously good at typing quickly. This keyboard makes it that much easier to do so, and I feel like my hands are a lot less fatigued after typing up a ten page paper. It's just got a really nice satisfying feel to the actuators under the keys.
* The lighting - There aren't many mechanical keyboards out there with backlighting (or weren't when I was looking), so this is a big plus.
* the sound - You'll see the cons of this in the next section, I like it during the day..
* looks - It looks pretty awesome!

Cons:
* The clicks - The feel of pressing down the keys would be lost without this, so I'm torn on it being good and bad. The sheer volume of the keys if you type quickly can be a bit ridiculous. If your computer is in your bedroom and your significant other likes to sleep while you're on the computer then you might want to consider another option.. This could end relationships.
* After two years of pretty vigorous use the ""A"" key has stopped lighting up. It kind of sucks considering that this keyboard cost so much, but overall it doesn't really impact my life too much. I know where the ""A"" key is and typically don't look down while typing.
* The glossy black finish - It attracts dust and fingerprints. However, it's razer, so that's pretty much inevitable with any of their products.

Overall I dropped what would have been a 5 star review down to 4 stars. I really LOVE the keyboard. I use a number of other ones during my workday (I'm in IT) and none compare to it. However, if you are paying $140 for a keyboard than the thing SHOULD continue to function in all capacities for years. Having one key's light go out isn't a deal breaker for me, but it makes me a bit concerned about how much life is left in the rest of the keys. With that said, typing with this keyboard is heavenly and I've never had a problem with its core function - to type. If you don't care about the volume of your typing then this is a great option for you. I showed it to a friend and had him sit down to type out some jibba jabba and he contacted me the next week to tell me that he had bought himself one and is in love with it. This keyboard should definitely be high on your list if you are shopping around for a mechanical keyboard.",Started great... now it's in the trash

B0182P4EPQ,1.0,"Absolutely horrible!!! Worst, and I mean WORST!! SRPG I have ever played in my entire life. Out of all the SRPG's I have played, this definitely beats the bunch as the worst one. It's quite sad as I am an indie developer and I love many games in the indie scene and I must say, most SRPG's and RPG's in the indie scene are better than this crap and the thing is, they don't even charge much either for their games.

I could make a better game than this honestly. I really don't know where to begin with this one, The opening made no sense, jumped right into a war going on with no explanation, tried to copy Fire Emblem's battle system and failed miserably, characters in the battle animation look like little bobble head toys attacking, character art is bad and the game is just so bland! I only pre-ordered this game because it said it was a decision based game and I love those but this one was not what I had expected. It also came with the bonus soundtrack and Artbook which were not worth it either. Only good thing I can say about this game is the music is decent.

Whatever you do, please do not buy this game! Not even for 5 bucks is this worth anything. I like Aksys because I have played some of their games on the PS Vita so I don't understand how this garbage was published by them. It's disappointing and I love Akysys but the developer of this game sucks. I am definitely refunding this game and can use that money for something better.

Instead, it's like Small Soldiers video game; your objective is to kill everything and everyone (what would ""real"" egyptologists think of this?).

Theres no incentive to keep playing, no grind to unlock weapons or attachments, prestiges are meaningless, the kill streaks are weak and hardly do anything, the maps are way too big even on ground war.

B00K1JBMGQ,1.0,"While Im a fan of NBA 2k this game isn't worth $60. I have 2k11, 2k12, 2k13 and now 2k15. All the pretty features including a new MyCareer, MyPark, face scan and NBA 2k TV are on next gen consoles (Xbox One & PS4) ONLY. 2k scammed us!

I've had the game for 2 days here's my thoughts. New things would be the rosters, the name change of the Hornets (formerly the Bobcats), new controls and new soundtrack. Only thing that has changed in MyCareer is the menu. You'll see your team's schedule for the week and after games see injury updates, rotation changes and career milestones.

The soundtrack has maybe 5 decent songs it gets annoying quick. Playing games you'll see alot of ""blocking fouls"". And wacky shots always seem to go in. The pro stick Im still learning I don't get why 2k changes controls every year. Im a pretty good defender in previous games but in this its hard to guard your man you might slip. Players tend to move slow sometimes on D. Grabbing rebounds not so easy I jump up for a rebound before the defender yet he gets it. Gameplay to me isn't realistic. No changes in 2k servers they continue to lag as usual.

Well crew mode is back but way too late we've been asking for it since 2k11. There's no more create a legend mode. Honestly if you want to get the game go ahead but buy used.

B00W8FYEU2,1.0,"As a fan of the old Battlefront, I'm nothing but insulted by this piece of s*** game. I waited for this game to be released, and preordered. Unfortunately, I played directly into EA's hands; there is virtually nothing about this that is at all similar to the old games. Here are my pros and cons:

Cons:
-It is ALL centered around multiplayer. Unfortunately, the servers have been down for almost a week. I haven't been able to connect to an EA server since the first few days after I received it. So, even if I wanted to play multiplayer to broaden the loadout I can use in the 4 singleplayer missions, I can't.
-Not at all similar to old Battlefront. There is no campaign mode. I suppose there's an instant action mode in the form of 4 missions (Hoth, Sullust, Endor, Tatooine), and 4 survival modes. But basically there are only 8 maps if you're playing singleplayer.
-The training missions are great, but they don't train you for anything. There are no singleplayer missions where you need to fly an X-wing, snow speeder, or drive an AT-ST. There might be on multiplayer, but good luck connecting to the servers
-Unrealistic gameplay. Somehow, I'm carrying infinite ammo and secondary weapons. But if I throw a grenade (a thermal detonator) I have to wait about 15 seconds to throw another?
-Your enemies are able to choose soldier classes, but you aren't. Once you've picked a loadout, you're stuck with it until you're done with the mission (except on survival). Each game starts mostly with regular soldiers, but as the mission progresses, the other team gets specialized players: heavies with rapid-fire weapons, jetpack troopers, snipers, and demolitions. You'll kick ass in the first half of the game, only to lose to an army of enemy specials. Also, your squad has maybe 4-5 guys. The enemy squad has double digit strength by the end of the mission.

Pros:
-Graphics look good

Basically, this is an incomplete game. I'm sure they'll charge for for additional features and maps that should've come with the original game. I 100% regret purchasing this, and I wish EA had never obtained the rights to this franchise. This game, in it's disc form, is worth about $15.",Poor excuse for a game.

I have read of others who have had similar centering issues: it is a good product out of the box, but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.

I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more, but it is much more adjustable, and the feel is more substantial to me.

B00NHV0XV0,1.0,"I noticed immediately these cans sounded rather strange and all I had to do look at the the surround angles to figure out why. These are advertised as 5.1 dolby digital surround but they only offer 4 direction inputs (front left, front right, back left, back right.) There's no front sound so you can't hear anything directly in front of you accurately. They also have a few preset equalizers but they all sound pretty flat, lacking any real bass or treble. The limited sound quality makes them less than ideal for music or movies. They also degrade to sound quality horribly if you use them on a mobile device with the supplied 2.5 to 3.5mm cable. They are also not completely wireless unless you're using them on ps3 as its the only system you can connect them to via bluetooth.

B00004TN9O,1.0,"While i do like the PS 2 line up of games the system itself i have lost all confidence in.

My first two PS 2's (the old bigger version) died from the disc read error problem.

I thought maybe in the new design this problem was addressed since the laser lens is more easily accesible and you'd think that would make it easy to clean it and stuff.

Well the new slim i bought a year ago just stopped reading discs to and i tried to clean the laser lens and it has no effect whatsoever.

I have bought 3 playstation 2's in the last 4 years.

If i buy another one it will be my 4th in 4 years and will bring up my total spent on new PS 2's to about 800 dollars.

More then it costs to buy the upcoming PS 3 on a much lesser system.

Conveniently they die on me after the warranty is gone.

I have 200 games that are all dust collectors now cause i refuse to buy another PS 2 again.

They have no durability whatsoever and the life of the systems i have owned seems to be just over a year on each.

Thats not acceptable.

I take good care of my systems and it doesn't matter.

With time the PS 2's just stop reading discs for whatever reason.

Then they want you to buy another one or ship it somewhere to be fixed (and charge you for it of course).

If it was an isolated thing with one faulty system i would have no problem with it.

But when all three systems i buy die from the same exact problem thats not acceptable.

Theres an obvious flaw in the building of this system and Sony simply refuses to address it and fix the problem where it starts in manufacturing.

Because people keep flocking to the store to but them Sony won't bother to fix it cause as long as they see profits that translates to them as being no problem with the system.

My advice is to avoid Sony console systems until they one day show they can create one with some durability.

Especially with the new PS 3,if that one ends up having the same flaw as this system its going to cost alot more to keep replacing.

For the time being Sony systems are a bad investment.

They just don't have long lasting durability.

B00002SVMG,1.0,"I am just as aware as anyone that people do not base their opinions of popular videogames on intelligent scripting, intelligent plot, intelligent substance, and intelligent thinking, so no one has to remind me.  If they did, this ""Colony Wars"" never would've left a single draft.

First of all, I too respect the abilities of developers of Psygnosis as much as anybody, and I would like to describe that respect, but I feel I have to say my piece about this game and come to my point.

There isn't a single idea in this game that isn't founded on generic thinking, the thievery of other games, and on movie cliche's.  There isn't one single idea based in science fiction, unlike its other competitor, ""Darklight Conflict,"" the true hero here, a little-known and original game released by Electronic Arts (EA) before ""Colony Wars"" was conceived.  ""Darklight Conflict"" was a space-shooter, and the gameplay idea for ""Colony Wars"" merely replicated that game.

Here's the story of ""Colony Wars"": ""You are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil Emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies,"" or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader) during the full-motion videos (FMVs) which were made by the same company who did special effects for ""Independence Day.""  Sounds like a direct, word-for-word copy of the plot of ""Star Wars.""

Here're the ideas of ""Colony Wars"": Large firey explosions even if they don't really exist in space because fire needs oxygen to exist and space has no atmosphere.  Black holes even if they don't exist as large red whirlpools in the middle of space backgrounds because their gravity is so intense, light cannot escape.  Spaceships even though they don't have wings like planes because there is no atmospheric friction to enable control using aero parts.  Also, they don't make loud rumbling noises when they pass by the camera lense because sound needs atmosphere.  Here, you get a future of imperialistic humans warring over the colonization and liquidation of the rest of the planetary systems in the universe for purposes of natural resources.  The mission and battle drill instruction voice is male, but it is okay for a female to narrate if limited to talking about other subjects like the options menus.  ""Space cowboys"" does not make science fiction, only unoriginal action games captivating non-thinkers.

Here's the story of EA's ""Darklight Conflict"":  You are a Top Gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you.  When you awake, you are in a completely foreign environment.  You realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle.  A voice speaks in English to you, but it is not the voice of any human.  You have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side, which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience.  Their vessels are signified by a symbol, a four-fingered hand.  At first, you will begin with training.  The small fighterships are oval, with fins protruding from what could be their sides.  The weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons.  Your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself, but it consumes a great deal of energy.  You venture through the wormhole warps, and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the travel.

Even the name ""Darklight Conflict"" is science fiction.  I could connect some of the premise of the game with the old sci-fi film ""This Island Earth"", but not much of its premise.  In that movie, a group of scientists are helping an alien race that appear about human, so the scientists don't find out they're aliens immediately.  When they do, the aliens take them to their planet and the alien commander tells them their planet is being overrun by another planet's race, and they recruited Earth's best scientists to come up with new and advanced technology to help them survive the invasion.  Their enemies soon destroy the planet, but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to Earth.  After their safe return, the aliens drive their ship into the sea, never to be heard from again.

Cons:
-Build quality is cheaper
-No stereo sound (every official Genesis had that and this doesn't include it without modding it)
-No RGB output (again, every official Genesis could do that, and is way better than the composite (yellow plug) video you're stuck with on this console without modding it)
-Audio is distorted on top of being mono-only
-No 32X compatibility
-No Sega CD compatibility

-Can buy a cartridge to play games off an SD card for a real Genesis (it's called an Everdrive. More expensive, but you can play the games on actual hardware)

2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy
3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow

B000QY9C90,1.0,"Do you like mindless shooting games? I don't and that is all this game is. There is no plot, and no storyline of any kind. All you do is move from safehouse to safehouse killing zombies along the way. There is no explanation given as to why there are zombies running amuck, and no backstories explaining who these four people are and why they are together. The zombies run at you fast and from all sides, but there is nothing you haven't seen here before. There is very little monster diversity, and very little weapon diversity. There are no objectives or missions, no sidequests, no character or story development, nothing.
I found the game extremely boring. The single player is short and easy. You can beat it in one day. There isn't even an ending.
This game is for people who don't want to have to think at all. The multiplayer I haven't done yet, and have no desire too now. There are no special moves or abilities in this game.

B00004U8KR,1.0,"As a fan of the movie, I had high hopes for this game, but they didn't pan out.  Not quite a true port - ""Rustin Parr"" is more of a cross-over between the BWP franchise and ""Nocturne"".

In the game, you play Elspeth ""Doc"" Holliday, a sort of gun-wielding investigator for a super-secret government organization of the 1940's - one introduced in ""Nocturne"".  With its own simulator room, the agency trains agents like Holliday to take on missions involving the supernatural (what we now call ""paranormal"") phenomenon.  Inevitably, Holliday's superiors have become drawn to the case of ""Rustin Parr"", a recluse who killed a group of children near his hometown of Burkittsville (formerly ""Blair""), Maryland in a psychotic rage in 1941.  Parr vaguely attributed his crimes to prodding by the legendary Elly Kedward (aka ""The Blair Witch"").  (Parr's story was told in the movie, and it's apparently his creepy house in which the final, cryptic scenes of the film play out.)  The premise of the game sort of clashes with the original's movie's selling point - which was to keep us wondering about whether these supernatural elements were genuine no atter how obvious it was they were.

I gotta confess that I couldn't get past the start-up level.  The game ran smoothly, as far as hardware is concerned, on my old Pentium 4 (at this stage, hardware specs are your least worry), but gameplay itself was a major hassle.  Using the ""Nocturne"" game engine, you maneuver Holliday in 3rd person.  Only, unlike other ""shooters"" - 3rd or 1st person, game perspective isn't fixed to the character, but to a room - set pieces through which your character enters & exits.  This allows for nice looking scenes (since your PC doesn't have re-render the backgrounds to compensate for movement) but extremely static ones.  It also makes it harder to confront threats and position yourself for such esoteric acts as opening doors or picking up objects.  This made for extremely frustrating gameplay from the very first level.  I got fed up just trying to navigate the simulator room, and decided to make the game vanish from my HD.  Recently, I thought I'd give the game a second chance, yet all I've found is the CD sleeve...",poor gameplay spoils a great subject

B01ENZU6J2,1.0,"Want a successor to Gears of War 3? This definitely isn't it. Welcome to Gears of War 25 years into the future after the final act of Gears 3. You play as Marcus' son for a very uninteresting campaign only waiting to finally see old versions of your favorite characters you grew so fond of years ago. It builds no emotional connection with a very boring anticlimactic cliffhanger ending (obviously so they can sell more gears of war games). Horde mode is a little better than gears 3 the only downfall is none of the maps are fun. Versus is as inconsistent as week 1 Gears of War UE and Judgement. A total cluster mess of guns that don't work consistently and terrible hit boxes. This game claims to have dedicated servers but every game has 1 person that obviously has an advantage as they just eat bullets while dishing out massive damage (the host as referred to in Gears of War 2) I am very sad that this game flopped so hard. There is no medal system (bronze - silver - Gold - Onyx), there are micro transactions (the bane to any game), and it feels like a shell of a Gears of War game.

Gone are the smashable fences and various other objects that made off roading so fun. In this version you can go off road more but you have NO reason to. And its NOT fun. Gone is the loose feeling of an arcade driving game with the heart of a sim. Now you have a sim with no heart (or brain) and a very very poor one at that. Gone are the reasons to explore the game.

And then all the usual problems with FP games: no peripheral vision, unrealistic camera angle, poor animation for interaction with objects, extremely confusing melee combat in FP, hiding behind cover = staring into walls, etc. Some claim FP games are more immersive. Seriously? Where's the immersion when you look down and don't see your chest/feet and realize that you are nothing but a floating camera and a pair of hoovering hands gliding through the game world?

As for the control, way too many abilities and gadgets without enough hotkeys. You can only assign four shortcuts to the D-pad (instead of 8 in Assassin's Creed), and often I have to pause/switch ability rather than transiting smoothly from one power to another.

As for the setting/story: steampunk has been done before (bioshock, a way superior game). No idea why many people are so excited about this one. Story (based on review) is quite banal. Graphics are mediocre.

B00DHF3A4S,1.0,"All pre-orders should have the opportunity for a full refund. This would be a ""fair"" game if it was released on the original Xbox or Playstation-2.

In my 30+ years of gaming I have never seen such a game-to-console mismatch.
Near all trailers are ""cut"" scenes and not actual game play.

The black bars top and bottom (letterbox) are annoying, but it doesn't matter what size your TV is, the graphics are so generic that the game is distorted and highly pixelated (I'm playing on a 55"" 240Hz TV).  The definition is simply not there, the game is ""lifeless"".  This factor alone ruins any chance of it bring you into its world.

Besides the cut scenes:
The character does not run with the landscape. His legs move as if they were an overlay.
The character's mouth moves completely unsynchronized, as they did 10+ years ago.
The head movement controls are a clunky ""box"" type; North, South, East, West.
At no point was my mind captivated by the game, I never felt I was the character.
Peripheral vision in the game was nearly nonexistent.

 The best review I read that truly sums up the ""feel"" of the gameplay was stated as: playing the game as if looking through a mail-drop slot.

This is perhaps the greatest failure, bait-and-switch game of the year.  Due to the ""Pre-order commercialization"" I would argue criminal intent, in the hopes of recovering costs by means of pushing pre-release orders.

B000X9FV5M,1.0,"Pros: Creative use of african ambiance..the music, sounds, accents of the characters you interact with, all give that ""you are here in Africa"" feeling. Music is tribal/ambient and thus fits well with the mood. Graphics are decent, though nowhere near Crysis, or for that matter, COD4. Decent frame rates on a lower core 2 duo.

Cons: respawning, poorly implemented stealth, mouse drags in high resolutions regardless of cpu/gpu, respawning, drm, senseless, random attacks by enemies, did I mention RESPAWNING enemies??. Tell me, how is it I can sneak up on some poor chump and slit his throat special forces style, and the WHOLE bloody camp knows about it the instant it happens? Didn't Ubisoft learn anything from Thief the Dark Project? Rumor has it they are working on Thief 4. God help us if they employ the same sneak tactics here, where every guard within 50 feet can hear a mouse fart. Then there is the respawning guards I just killed, including respawning jeeps (huh?). It is inconceivable to me that the very jeep I blew up not two seconds ago is now following me with armed guards every 13 seconds?
 You already know about the DRM so I will skip that portion.
Part of the allure of this game was that its touted as a mercenary for hire sort of game whereby you obtain contracts to acquire wealth (diamonds) in exchange for downing baddies. But what good is it for immersion if you plug the guy with 10 bullets and he STILL doesn't go down?? I used to know a guy who went through BUD/S (SEAL training) years back, and he would say that if you take a bullet by one of these big guns, you are going down fast. Yet it takes 20 bullets to down any guards, unless it is a head shot at close range. Ubisoft definitely dropped the ball on this one. Mark this one: AVOID.

The reason for my 1 star rating, is because Microsoft customer service is horrible. I bought my kinect in September of 2015. A couple of months later, it begins having issues staying powered on. This is a common problem with the sensor. I send it to Microsoft and they give me a refurbished one, so at this point I'm happy. In Early August 2016, I have the same issue again, so I troubleshoot and call Microsoft. They told me to go buy a new one and that this new kinect has no more warranty. It's only a couple of months old...

MICROSOFT does not guarantee you a working product for less than a year. They know there's a common problem and they don't care.

I miss having the kinect around. I would definitely buy another one if Microsoft cared about its customers more than making another sale from a chump like me.

B00006BMQB,1.0,"The first Tomb Raider was what got me interested in the Playstation console.  Over the years they've gotten progressively better.  Then there was a long lapse between the 4th installment and now.  What in the world happened!??!

This title is utterly useless.  The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!

The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.

I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the ""bosses"" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.  You consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it, it's like, ""How dumb is that!!"".  After performing the moves to kill the creature, it was really quick and not very satisifying.

They include this lame ""Making of"" which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took.  All it did was waste space on the DVD.  Who cares how you made the game.  It didn't give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible!!

I thought that improved gameplay and more realism would trump the details that are missing this year.  The attributes that you can improve are weak, barely make a difference and wasteful too.  It just isn't a fun game anymore, and like all football and madden fans, it just makes me sad.

The 2k sports games are all so much better than the new Madden.  Of course Franchise mode is still there, it only takes 30 seconds and half a brain to figure that out.  But, it's just not as fun as previous years, the gameplay itself doesn't feel much better.  I tried but just couldn't stick with it.  Don't waste your money.

B01574SORE,1.0,"This console is just not good. Let me count the ways shall we.... In no particular order....WARNING....incoming rant: It has no games and most of the games it has are short and forgettable: It overheats... it ejects discs out of the blue; the controllers are not as comfy as xbox one; the batteries burn out fast and you can't play at least 2 hours straight without them dying; not to mention once the rechargeable battery dies you can't do anything because the battery is embedded in the controller and you have no option to replace them. So guess what dead battery= dead controller; With the Xbox One they give you the option to take out the batteries---having flexibility and options is always a better choice; Playstation network is terrible and is ALWAYS down so forget about playing online....what's that you say? ""No problem it's free.""----NOPE... on ps3 online play was free on ps4 you pay. So you are throwing money away because PSN is not good----just look up and google Sony PSN hack of 2011 where thousands if not millions of customers' credit cards were compromised; the user interface is horrible plain and boring and is the same boring UI since the beginning of the ps3 days. Meanwhile Microsoft constantly is updating the Xbox One so it feels fresh; the ps4 is disorganized and you can never find what you want(just try using the SEARCH feature... oh my); the whole system sounds like a jet engine when it's on;

Xbox one has better apps; it doesn't do true backwards compatibility. On Xbox One you can play 360 games on ps4 you CANNOT play ps3 games.....BUT WAIT....you can play ps2 games! But wait....wanna pop in that ps2 disc? Sorry it won't work because Sony's definition of backwards compatibility is PURE software emulation; back to the games...it just has nothing but re-masters and indie games; don't get me wrong I have nothing against indie games but the problem with the ps4 is that it doesn't have any triple A games to get excited about. The one game that is close to that status might be bloodborne but that's an extremely niche title and it's just not for everyone. Not to mention it's extremely difficult and casual gamers are more likely to to turn their backs on it. The bottom line is that the gaming division of Sony is not like it use to be. It was great back in the ps1 and even ps2 days but those days are LONG GONE. This company has no innovation. All they do is lie and copy what Microsoft does. Microsoft says in June at E3 they will do backwards compatibility with 360 games then Sony reps respond by saying we don't need backwards compatibility we are offering the rip-off service known as PS NOW LMAO. So what does Sony do? Oh what did you say Sony? Microsoft doesn't know their fans? Backwards Compatability is not what we want? Okay so why now five months later are you trying to offer Backwards Compatability? That's right because they have no innovation and just copy copy copy. Lets call it the Copystation4. The ps4 is THE most overrated console in the HISTORY of gaming. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get an Xbox One.... or even a Wii U. Trust me in a few weeks the ps4 will serve no purpose except to collect dust and you'll be returning it. It's amazing how much I see people returning their ps4s for an Xbox One after gaining hands-on experience with the thing instead of just following hype. Don't do it guys.

Not recommended at all! Folks do not waste money on this. Sony's Playstation network is very poor. This is from the same company that had their playstation network hacked in 2011. If you don't know what I'm talking about just google playstation network hack of 2011. You will get all the information. Basically sony compromised millions of people's personal information and credit card information and tried to cover it up. All this company (at least their playstation division) does is lie and try to hide things for their incompetency. Why would you want to pour money into a company that is incompetent, lies and doesn't even try to correct their mistakes? Google again the latest DDOS attacks on the playstation network and Xbox Live service. Sure attacks can happen but it's how you respond that counts. Xbox Live and PSN went down on Christmas. Meanwhile Xbox Live went back online while the poor playstation network was down for like 5 days? Heck I think people are still having problems now. Just google intermittent outages on playstation network. UNACCEPTABLE. As far as making great HDTVs Sony is number 1 and in my opinion the best. This is what they should stick to...TVs. As far as software, firmware updates, etc.. they are TRASH! Same goes for their crappy vaio laptops. They are just not that great as a company when it comes to networks, software, etc...

B0085L2T0A,1.0,"Prior to my update; I had a high opinion of this game.
However, as of January 2013, I deem this game is in no condition to be sold.

It is HEAVILY bugged.
The game publisher THQ went bust, and now no one will fix the many problems still in the game!

Here are just some of the many bugs that will forever go unpatched;

** Story Designer bugs
(No crowd audio during matches in Story Designer. Also players have reported freezing when trying to save a created story among many, many other issues.)
** Superstar threads glitch
(When you create a new attire coloration for some superstars, the attire will appear spotty in-game)
** Ring announcer bug
(The ring announcer will sometimes not announce a superstar as they make their way out to the ring, but instead just say ""AND"")
** Created finishers bug
(Created finishing moves deal considerably less damage than ordinary special moves)
** Various moves cause perma-freezing
(Though not very frequently; at times when a player does a move on another, it will cause a perma-freeze to one or sometimes both superstars)
** 1 count bug
(even after heavily damaging an opponent [A.I. controlled] you'll get only a one-count)
** Broken Attributes
 (Players have tested attributes and proven that many of them have no affect)
** Broken Pin bar
(even after dealing a considerable amount of damage to an opponent [user controlled] their kick out meter will still be large.)
** Triple-Threat matches don't work [A.I]
(A.I. in triple threat matches are the absolute worst. Triple-Threats will always turn into a handicap match one way or another because A.I. only changes target when you hit them. If nobody hits them, guess what? Whoever they were targeted on when the match begins remains their target throughout!)

Virtually every mode of the game has some sort of problem. Including the Universe mode.

B00005C4HL,1.0,"Considering how much I've hated (and continue to hate) regular Mortal Kombat 3 since it was first released almost 12 years ago, it was only natural that I would also have a strong dislike for ""Ultimate"" Mortal Kombat 3. But, if you've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games, here's why I really hate this game.

- Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market, making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.

- The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3. Which means, I hate it. It's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment, so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning. They did this on purpose to annoy ME. If the actual fighting stinks, it doesn't matter WHO returns. It's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters, but they somehow DIDN'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place.  So running around delivering combos is *still* here.  BAD move.

- I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package, but instead, when you play the game, you find out that a bunch of things are missing. That's exactly what we have with this game. It's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside. Okay, the game isn't as bad as waking up Christmas morning and being insulted with an empty box, but still...

It would be best to never even think about touching this game.","so bad, so boring, so much pain"

B00ZJRHSRW,1.0,"I think we have all become so used to wireless controllers, when I saw this on Vine, I almost laughed out loud.  I mean really, a wired controller seems so OLD I thought.  But then I started reading the reviews and thought, ""Hey, I might need to check this out"".

I'm glad I did.

I must say, that the standard Xbox One controllers are very nice.  However, that glowing orb in the middle of the controller has always bothered me when I play in near total darkness.  So I also thought, this controller with lights would be the same way.  Not so.

The fact that you can cycle through colors, schemes and see the innerworkins of the controller make this a great addition to your console, regardless of whether it is wired or not.  It feels steady and well built in your hand and has held up to even the most brutal online matches I've put it through.  While I will say there is no perceptible increase in advantage over wireless, this thing just looks amazing so I will keep using it.

I played the game for a couple of hours or so, then finally gave up in boredom and frustration.

Unlike most RPGs today in which you control most of the game functions and character actions with the mouse, this game is almost totally controlled by keystrokes. This is a step backwards in technology of about ten years, in my opinion, and slows things down incredibly. Further, it requires memorizing all the appropriate key functions; like stepping back in time from Windows to MS-DOS.

The character inventory system is clunky and counter-intuitive, and very cumbersome to manipulate.

Worse yet, you can't exit cut/movie scenes to re-enter gameplay, so if you're having to repeat an action from a save, you have to sit through these looooong cut scenes repeatedly.

That is my biggest issue with the game is the constant running out of ammo and having to beat creatures who do massive damage and then trying to find a way to heal myself just to do it all over again.

Playing as Turok, you traverse a dino infested planet with your group of unbearably cliched space marine muscle man buddies as you look for a way to escape, and in doing so, you'll find yourself often reaching for the power button as you attempt to escape this awful game.

It has slow, clunky controls, godawful AI in both the enemies and allies, poor level design that offers zero freedom and zero variety, crap weapons that seem to randomly change how much damage they decide to inflict every time you fire and a storyline so banal you'll wish you wish you were watching Matrix Revolutions again instead of playing this.

I can think of practically nothing to recommend about this game... seriously. The visuals aren't the worst ever I suppose, and you FORCE some small fun out of the online if you really try to, but any game that forces you to look for enjoyment in any way is obviously a failure right from the off.

B00IAVDPSA,1.0,"I purchased this hoping to replace my current amazon fire stick with a beefier device (xbone).

I mistakenly assumed that this would be wireless/bluetooth, not IR. In 2015 I would hope we would no longer need to point a remote directly at a console for it to function, but I guess Microsoft disagrees.

Pros:

* Looks nice
* Functions
* Volume controls work with TV, which is nice

Cons

* IR, not bluetooth/wireles. In my case, while I can see the xbone there is a table in front of it that often blocks this remote from functioning half the time.
* Very heavy - I'd guess 3x as heavy as the fire stick remote
* Very thick - Again, easily 3x as thick as the fire stick remote

B00452VGZW,1.0,"Having played and loved every C&C game, this one is an amazing disapointment.

Let's set aside for a moment the insane DRM that many people use to base their 1-star rating on...

EA Games had a brilliant line of games with the C&C Series.  They tried something new years ago with Renegade, creating a first-person shooter based on the series.  It was not well received, and EA didn't follow up on it.  You would think they would have learned their lesson.

As many have stated, this game would have been fine as a launch of a new C&C franchise.  It would have probably have flopped as badly as this, since the gameplay is very boring.  But why - WHY - did EA have to choose the penultimate C&C game to start the design from scratch?  How could any of the developers have not spoken up and said ""this is not C&C!""

Gone from this game is everything you knew and trusted about C&C.  No more base-building - at all.  You know those missions in the old games that you never really liked?  The ones where you were given a tiny handful of units and told to complete the level?  Well, that is what EVERY level of this game is like.

To make matters worse, you now have a roving unit-builder in every mission.  These come in three flavors - Attack, Defense, and Support.  The one you choose basically decides which units you can build.  You need to decide at the very start of every mission which type of unit you will use, yet you will have absolutely NOTHING to base you decision on.  If you choose incorrectly, your mission will be really difficult.  By the time I had finished the single-player campaign, I had STILL not been given the chance to use all of the units, nor had all of the power-ups been unlocked.  This game was so poorly thought out, it is a joke.

In this crapfest, instead of mining ore, you ""gain experience"" by picking up Tiberium crystals scattered around the map.  Let me repeat that - YOU gain experience - your opponents in the single player campaign do not.  The easy-to-find crystals are worth 5 attribute points.  You can use these to increase certain abilities, like a fast reload on your units, or faster units.  But in a typical level, these cost 1 point each, and there are only 4 powerups available on most levels.  So you collect one crystal and you instantly have maximum power for that level.  Is that insane, or what?  This is the kind of pointless ""fun"" you will experience on every level.  If you decide to go after multiple crystals, there appears to be no reward.  If there was, I never experienced it in the Single player game.

And let's talk for a moment about the story - or lack thereof.  Until now, every C&C game has at least had an interesting story - one that unfolded as you progressed.  Remember the time-travelling craziness with Einstein?  None of that here.  Honestly, I have no idea WHAT the plot was about.  In the NOD campaign, you play some soldier that (I guess) was killed and revived by Kane.  You are told that all hope rests on you.  Kane's very future is in your hands.  Yet, when you start your first mission, you have absolutely NO POWER whatsoever.  You start with ZERO experience points.  You are essentially a rookie.  Got that?  You are a Red Shirt, sent on some mission and YOU are Kane's only hope.  Heck, wasn't Kane ripping people apart using only his mind a few games ago?  Now for some reason he doesn't seem to have any power himself.  It's all up to a rookie...  What an incredible travesty EA has unleashed.

I used coupons to get my Amazon price down to $32.95 - I still feel cheated.

Now, back to the dreaded DRM...

If you purchase the DVD version of this game, you will have to do the following just to play it:
1) Open the box with the SECURITY device enclosed
2) Install the game using your COPY PROTECTED DVD
3) SIGN UP for an EA account
4) Enter the SECURITY KEY found in your manual
5) AGREE to have your PC monitored at all times while you play the game - even the single player version
6) Have SPYWARE installed on your PC
7) AGREE that even though you purchased the game, you do not OWN your copy
8) Launch the game with your ORIGINAL DVD in your PC
9) HOPE your Internet connection does not go down during a mission, or you will start all over again.

That's a heck of a lot of security just to play a game you purchased.  I'm seriously surprised there wasn't a specimen cup in the box...

Remember the days when you installed a game and launched it anytime you wanted?  Sure, you may have had to enter the 3rd word of line 12 of page 4 of your user guide.  Seriously, this game has every anti-pirating device known to man except for that one.  And you know what?  You can bet that 5 minutes after the game was officially released, the first cracked copy appeared on torrent sites.  Yet EA believes that by treating the customer as a criminal, they are winning the war against piracy.  Take a few minutes and look at every Amazon rating for games released with DRM in the past three years.  You will not find a single one that is over 2 stars.  People are royally P.O.'d at companies that treat the customer like this.  The backlash is enormous, yet they continue to do it.  And think about this - had the game not thoroughly sucked out loud, and had you wanted to take your laptop on a trip to play it, you had better have Internet access at all times.  No playing on a plane or in a car for you.  Because if you are not tethered to the EA computers and monitored at all times, you must be trying to steal something.

Whether you hate DRM like me, or whether you cannot possibly believe that EA seriously abandoned the entire concept of C&C - trust me - do NOT waste your money on this game.  I wanted so much to believe the negative reviews were simply due to the DRM.  Unfortunately, they are all dead-on.  This game is thoroughly unplayable, unenjoyable, and uninteresting.",Not much I can say that hasn't already been said
B0050SY9WC,1.0,"This game started out very appealing, but it went away quick after you get passed the beginning phase. The camera movement is very poor as well. It pans too slowly, as well it gets very jittery when you're in a gun fight. It's not very exciting when you lose sight of your opponent, and you're constantly having to adjust your position, because you get too close to one enemy and the camera starts to get buggy. The weapons are very limited as well.

As far as the plot goes, it's very linear. You MUST follow the path the story takes you. You can not explore, there are no secrets to hidden weapons, and you can not choose your own path. The fighting gets boring too, because it seems to be too much of it, and not enough story interaction.

Not to mention in most areas, the white lights blinds your screen. I tried adjusting the video, but it doesn't do anything. I wasted $60 on this gamble. I should have stopped when I was ahead with Deus Ex.

B00178630A,1.0,"A red flag should go up immediately upon reading the end user license agreement that they make you accept.  To paraphrase:  We do not guarantee the ability to actually be able to play the game.  That tells you all you need to know about the online at all times requirement.

In many ways Diablo 3 reminds me of some disappointments I had with Dungeon Siege 3.  There's the system that awards a player with every skill by the time a certain level is attained.  Gone are the days where you had a stable of characters each with their own specialization.  There's the system that automatically assigns stat points, another aspect that will be the same every time you play the game.  The only way to modify stat points is via item attributes.  Levels that are tight corridors.  While still fun in their own way all of these things detracted from the replay value of Dungeon Siege 3.  It was a play it a few times game and then forget it because you already knew which skills you'd end up with and what stats you'd have before you even started your second playthrough.  The exact same ones you had the last time.  Diablo 3 suffers the same fate, it's not going to last 12 years like its predecessor because there is no depth in character uniqueness.

The game is also shorter.  Sure, you can play it over again at a higher difficulty but it's still disappointing to have to play the exact same levels three times over to arrive at a decent target time for what should have been the time it takes to play through the game once.

With the online requirement that perpetually threatens playing time (and restricts play on my terms) and a severely shortened replay value I found it difficult to justify the initial price tag.  For what it is this game should have been much, much cheaper at launch.  I would say wait for a price drop but this is Blizzard.  You'll be waiting a long time for that.  Better to just skip this one and look at other good up and coming action RPG games.",It's sad to have waited so long for this

-1 star-gameplay-This game was SOOOOOOOOO poorly made. In the easiest difficulty i lost 8-5. With the same teams in 2 harder difficulties, i won 35-0!!Also, u ALWAYS get away with stealing from first to second, but u NEVER be safe stealing from second to third.
-1 star- This game gets boring sOO eaily becuase it only has 2 good modes. There is practice, and exibition which is the same. Home run derby WHICH IS TERRIBLE BECUASE U CANT FACE THE COMPUTER!, and a season which is terrible because half way through the season u always get a roster problom which is impossible to fix.
-1 star-Crashes easily and takes 25 minutes to instal- this game which is about 300 meg took 25 minutes to install on my SUPER good 1.2 ghz amd athelon pc. Diablo 2 which is 1 gig, 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT!, took 3 minutes to install. Also, when u play this and u forget to close ur instant messeges, and u get an instant messege, the game minimizes. ONCE IT MINIMIZES, SAY GOOD BYE!! cuase once u click on the game to bring it back the screen turns black and it freezes.

B0008EZDDM,1.0,"I have played Star Wars: Galaxies for 782 days according to the /getvet command. I have purchased all of the expansions out to date. I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.

I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change. Because most likely the next expansion will also bring a new version of SWG as SOE and LA attempt to copy whichever game is doing better then.",Boycott Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts.

B00EV4O86I,1.0,"As far as the product itself, it's a well built console. The construction feels solid and the screen is well-sized. However, the blue is quite bright. It might be too much for some adult gamers. Kids might enjoy the color, but be aware it's a slightly teal-ish sky blue, and NOT a navy blue. I would describe the color as more bright than deep.

Do be aware that Amazon does NOT sell Nintendo consoles (there was some sort of contractual dispute and Amazon decided to drop those sales). So you will only find them being sold by third parties, which are often intent on jacking up the prices. If you want to pay the normal price stop by a game store or other physical retailer. I'll avoid posting the price or specific names because Amazon might delete reviews that mention such information - but needless to say, you're almost always going to get a better deal on Nintendo hardware from a retailer other than Amazon.","Well-built console, but don't buy it on Amazon"

B00149PCAO,1.0,"And I am tempted to rate lower. This game is extremely frustrating. Given how popular it is and highly rated plus the anticipation for the new game I expected a lot more of this game. Yes it is a beautiful game and the idea is cool as well as the mechanics - though it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief since many of the moves cannot be done by any human being. Or at least a human on a planet with gravity. But what has forced me to lower my rating - this game is extremely frustrating. Unless you know exactly what to do you will keep dying until you figure it out or go online. I HATE going online to see how things are done but this game has forced me several times and I am in the middle of level 1. The way to go is seldom obvious or even partially visible. I have died dozens of times in different areas trying to figure out exactly what is the next. And even with the Runners vision and things marked with red it is NOT noticible. Really frustrating.

B000ZK7ZKS,1.0,"This is the 3rd time i've tried to install this game in the hopes that it will be good. I get it installed & then start to play & i then remember why i stopped playing it the first time. Its a pointless rail shooter, with no real content, whose ""shooting,"" (which is the main point of a shooter) i poorly coded & just not fun to play. I know its staying true to the movie that you have to wrangle the ghosts, but a 20 year old movie does not stand up to the rigors of a contemporary shooter.

I came in hoping for non stop excitment & this game gives you non stop boredom... Its a constant crawl at the speed of molases. Many times in this game you are barrarged by stupid convoluted faux conflict... An by stupid convoluted faux conflict i mean finding you can't go one way on a map, then having something explode making you have to go back the way you came, just so you get to utilise a new do-hicky you just got to get pass the thing you couldn't get passed the first time... I know console gamers are used to that kind of inanity, as its standard for there platform, but as a PC player i can say i hate it. If you can't flesh out a ghostbusters game of all things, without having to pad its levels with this nonsense, you need to stop developing games & go back to game design school.

B00005V3F1,1.0,"Then was a time when you could look nowhere else for the best sports games. It did not matter how many sports games were made, if it wasn't made by Ea Sports then it was not worth playing. That era is sadly gone. It has passed the same way that many of the old stadiums have. We now reflect on the games of old because the last thing one wants to do is look at what Ea is producing now.
  Their games are worse than Michael Jordans attempts to hit a curve. Triple play 2002 has shown again that the creativity, imagination and dedication to the sport they are trying to emulate has faded.
  The graphics of this game are just plain bad. It is slow, The players are out of proportion and the overall effect just isn't there. The gameplay is bad and players are unresponsive to commands. Batting is done via that new idea in baseball game. The stupid target/crosshairs box. Someone should just realise that idea is just plain dull.
  Realism is not really there much either. At the end of the day it just is not that much fun. A game I did enjoy was high heat. Not a great leader in any area. But the gameplay was strong enough to have fun with. And having fun is what I want from a game.

B003KMHBCA,1.0,"This game cheats so bad. Not as bad as their Android version of Monopoly, but almost as bad. On the Android version the difficulty level basically means how bad it will cheat on it's dice roll. After five games where I hit the income tax space 80% of the time I went around the board, but the CPU player hit that same spot maybe 5%... you might start wondering if the game is rigged. It's not limited to income tax either. You will land on all it's properties while it dances right by all yours without hitting anything.

On this Xbox version it rolls doubles on almost every single one of it's turns. And then rolls a second set of doubles on about half it's turns. It will also keep you landing on ""just visiting"", Chance, and Community Chest and other spaces such as those making it impossible to buy any property as it scoops everything up quickly due to it landing on normal properties and getting multiple rolls since it rolls doubles on every turn as mentioned.

EA has a history of substituting game intelligence for rigged dice to balance out gameplay. This leads to much cheaper developer costs, since instead of having to program a real game engine, they can just hard wire the dice to control how things play out. EA also has some of the most over the top copyright protection schemes of any software publisher on earth. Just check out the reviews of the PC version of Spore to see a sample of what I'm talking about.

I wish Parker Brothers wouldn't have farmed out all the Monopoly games to EA, since the concepts of these games were great, but EA butchered the execution. Without the cheating, rigged dice, and other frustrations this would be a 5 star game (so would the Android version), but instead of being fun it just will make you angry and stressed out.",EA Cheats

I was very excited to get this to use on my PC but after a short usage I was very disappointed. Buttons gotten more tricky to press around and the grips felt terrible.

Good luck because you're just as likely to frame skip over the target and shoot a wall. This is utterly inexcusable given how well Duke Nuke'em, Powerslave, and Hexxen play on the Saturn.

B0029ZUPYK,1.0,"I was playing the game and somewhat interested in it at first, but it really didn't make any sense.

I had no idea why I was fighting demons right off the bat when I wasn't even in hell. And then I noticed that after the first cut scene with Beatrice, I begin fighting right away with no explanation at all, in an entirely different place.

The gameplay itself is like Devil May Cry without guns. Just about everything is copied. You have the combos ranked in name by the cool factor of the game, you have the level design, the way the bosses and mini bosses come up, the button mashing. It just doesn't do it as well as Devil May Cry. Even the upgrading is a lot like DMC.

I heard the game was a great big God Of War ripoff, but I'd say it's a DMC ripoff.

Finally what made me stop playing the game however, was the glitches. I encountered a few minor ones, but the worst one was that demons can throw me through the firewalls put up to block your path, and this freezes the game. Because then you are on the other side of the fire wall, where you are not supposed to be, and the game decides to hold everything in place. You can only access the menus, no moving, even the monsters stop moving.

I didn't find the plot that interesting either, nor did it make much sense what I played.",Glitchy DMC Ripoff
B00FNKMVUO,1.0,"I had high hopes for the Venus mouse.  First off the packaging is nice, still smiling at this point.  The mouse also feels pretty darn good in my hand.  Comfortable and ergonomic enough. After getting through a bit of the Chinglish (poorly written English, from China) I got the mouse installed and working.  This is where things start to get bad.

The smooth plastic footing was stuck on crooked and was peeling up in two places.  Not a huge deal as they provide a replacement with the mouse.  The tuning weights were also not included with my mouse.  There is a black container but not metal weights in it or the mouse.  :(

The most important thing for a gaming mouse (imho) is the ability to track well as well as programmable buttons for MMO.  The list of features, and price, look good but the tracking is pretty bad.  I am using an expensive gaming mouse pad and thought this might be the problem.  I tried it on a wooden desk and also with a plain black mouse pad.  Long story short there is significant lag and jittery movement.  I restarted my gaming rig, I tried re-installing the software, etc... It would work well for 20-60 seconds and then the cursor would hop around.  I have a hard time believing this is true 16,400 DPI.  I have no way of figuring this out.  If it is a true 16,400 DPI mouse it must be using an inexpensive sensor.

B00CYS5DU8,1.0,"I could not be more disappointed by the effort (or lack thereof) in this latest iteration of Madden NFL. Though I am not surprised that EA Sports has once again repurposed the same game as year's past, updated the rosters and threw a new athlete on the cover and sold it for $60.

I have several issues with this franchise and I will tell you exactly why:

1. Madden is a monopoly; this is no secret. There was a class-action lawsuit earlier this year and I hope to see many more in the near future. EA Sports has exclusivity rights to NFL and NCAA football games. What that means to us football fans is that EA Sports has ZERO incentive to put an exceptional product on the market because there is no company out there driving innovation! Samsung needs Apple and vice versa... AT&T needs Verizon and vice versa... it is what makes a healthy commodities marketplace. If 2K Sports was able to create an NFL football game again, I guarantee you would see a much improved Madden experience. This leads me to my next point.

2. The Launch Gameplay Demos are an absolute, bold face lie! The in-game action is nothing like what they depict in their video demo. The clips were taken out of context via in-game replays where Madden is shown in a more advantageous, yet deceptive manner by utilizing alternate camera angles and increased detail on player models. The actual gameplay looks almost identical to current-gen games. The ball is magnetic at times to the player's hands, the grass divots and footprints disappear the second the player moves from a given spot, the players are stiff and still look frumpy, the net behind the goal post stays perfectly still when you kick a field goal ect. They took the existing game and added detail to the grass and the crowd. If you haven't bought a Madden game since about 2008, go ahead and pick this one up, but if you've played Madden recently, you will not only be disappointed in this game but downright PISSED OFF!

3. There are still so many little things EA can do to make Madden exponentially better than what it is now, but they are too damn lazy to do it! They could make the player bodies more biologically accurate and make their movements during cut scenes less robotic. They could lower the camera angle to better simulate real game action. They can add in some trash talking between plays. They can add unique stadium attributes that affect the players' ability to execute a perfect play (i.e. ground-shaking crowd noise on a third down in Seattle or Kansas City where the crowd plays a HUGE part in the outcome of a game and can be a real difference maker.)

This game has not evolved in any way since some minor graphical improvements from 2010. In fact, some might argue that it is a less enjoyable experience than in years past. I really hoped that a powerful new gaming system would inspire the industry-worst creative team at EA Sports to push the limits of the PS4 and Xbox One capabilities and provide a ground-breaking football simulation experience for the loyal fans of the franchise, but that did not happen. The only way we as consumers can stop this injustice is to stop buying their games all together. Let's show EA that we are not the mindless drones they think we are that will buy up any piece of crap they serve us.

Light does not turn off when Mac went to sleep. Solution is that pull out cable.

Driver software(Razer Synapse) does not initialize keyboard and mouse properly after OS launched.
Solution is that you need to open Razer Synapse manually and open Keyboard and Mouse setting every time.

Keyboard got sticky sometimes by software. Solution is just undo. If you cannot undo some software, you are out.

Mouse left click gets compromised as right click.
Solution is pull out mouse and keyboard cable and plug again. Only sometime it works.

Some wrong frequent input from keyboard or mouse, that makes active window inactive.
How can I use this?

Last option is reboot OS and hope recovered.

B00ZDNNRB8,1.0,"I've had the infamous ""left-stick drift"" design flaw happen with 3 Microsoft Xbox controllers in 1 year, all under 1 year of use: 2 Elites & 1 Lunar White.  They all had the same left-stick upward drift, which will cause the controller to move without user input in menus or game play.  Very annoying problem, and renders the controllers useless--unless you're okay with death-in-game caused by faulty controllers.  My 1st Elite was replaced since I had purchased it with a console bundle, and under the same 1-year warranty as the console.  Now I need to attempt to have these other 2 out-of-warranty controllers replaced because of their design flaws.","Very annoying problem, and renders the controllers useless--unless you're okay ..."

B00BXONG7G,1.0,"If you are a Call of Duty Player looking for more with a few differences I would try one of the free Battlefield games out there first, or wait for Bad Comapny of BF 3 to go on sale Those Battlefield games are nearly identical to BF4, so playing them will give you an idea if you are going to like BF4.  (EDIT: The wording on this did not make sense I changed it.)

If you did not like Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 this game is no different. Just a Graphical update and some new maps.

With that said I am running the Game on Ultra, and though in screen shots the difference between BF3 and BF4 looks awesome.. In the actual game I often forget I am playing BF4. The graphics simply do not look any different when in the midst of battle.  Black Ops 2 Still looks MUCH better in most areas of game play. BF3 and BF 4 do look better when you are looking out at a vista. But that is a matter of opinion.

As of this review the game is 100% not noob friendly. Everyone in the game after 10 hours of multi-player is a crack shot and will snipe you from all over the map on all of the maps. In fact I have not played a single game in the past 24 hours where each team was not apparently 80% snipers.

Spawn camping (getting killed the moment the level loads) Is extremely bad in the game. A few maps are worse than others, but for the most part every single map design allows for you to be shpot in the head before you are even done loading into the game.

Also my experiences with Amazon Customer Service and Origin Customer Service have been less than ideal. I have been trying to trurn the game with multiple calls to amazon and Origin and neither will budge. I understand that it is not the norm to allow the return of games, but that needs to change. I will probably be making my next game purchase (CoD:Ghosts?) From Gamestop simply due to their very generous return policy.

Sorry for the Rant sounding review, but I just need to express my extreme disappointment with this title. I see more innovation in the yearly CoD titles than I see in the Battlefield series.","Boring, Slow, Un-rewarding gameplay."
B00178630A,1.0,Played about 100 hours and can't even look back at it.  I kept hearing you have to play to inferno and I did.  It wasn't time well spent and I agree with most the item hunt and characters along with end game needed and required more attention.  I hate that one achievement is leveling up 2 characters of the same type to level 60 when there is no difference between those characters.  Basically this is a review to say put back complexity into games which deserve it and not dumbed down to maximize profits for corporations.  Diablo was going to make money regardless and this decision ruined the game for me.  Don't care about the required Internet connection I get it.

Buttons are cheap feeling but do the job.  How long they will last is debatable.
Case is solid feeling has has nice weight to it.  Build quality is great.
Feet hold the joystick in place properly.

The bad.

Joystick handle is ambiguous.  Extremely sloppy!
It's so sloppy that if you play Ryu, you may never get a fireball to come out.
Let me quantify that last statement.  I got maybe 5 out of 50 to register.  It's so bad that you have to slow down your play and pray to get one to register.
The uppercut move when I first got the joystick was flawless.  Then all of a sudden it stopped working.  That's right; it just stopped registering also.  WTF???

I have concluded that the contacts in the joystick are so cheap that they are shifting thus making the ability to replicate moves impossible.  Which makes the joystick worthless.

Oh and setup was a tad of a pain.  But I wouldn't have docked it points if the controller was decent.  But pain in the ass setup for mediocre game play is terrible.

B00DHF3NS6,1.0,"Another piece of razer garbage.  I'm not a fan of razer do to the lack of Quality Assurance Testing on all of their products.  The fight stick market is small though, and this was the first of its kind to be able to open up for easy modifications.  The early moments of me having this stick, I loved it.  Felt great.  Great spacing and everyone loves the feel of a genuine Sanwa Parts.

Here's their fatal flaw.  They made their cable proprietary and don't sell other cables!  Their female connector itself is very flimsy, if any pressure is put against the cable towards the stick, you risk pushing in the female connector further back into the stick (cheap glue).  Due to their POS connectors, the sticks can randomly be disconnected!  As seen in Evo, Capcom Cup, AND final round.  The drivers are also wonky and sometimes try to take over my audio or disconnect and won't connect without rebooting the system!  I've had several matches in USFIV and SFV where I'm playing ranked games, the stick disconnects, and it won't reconnect unless the entire system is reset.  Also,I have speakers, and a headphone jack, I don't need your extra jack in the stick.

Functionaliy aside, they made it very cheesy with their huge ugly razer image on the stick.  The first thing I did when I got that was rip that out from under the plexiglass.

$250 paper weight.

B001ATHKVC,1.0,"Well, here we go again. EA apparently wants to drive all PC gamers away from their hobby and force them onto consoles or another diversion entirely. Just like Spore and Red Alert 3, EA has instituted DRM that limits the number of unique installations.

After you buy Crysis Warhead, you may install it as many times as you like on 5 different authenticated machines. Obviously, this wouldn't be a problem for the folks that buy a Gateway off the shelf every five years, but it will be an issue for people that tinker with their PCs and change components a lot.

B001U2BMH2,1.0,"I have spent many hours playing the Wii sport tennis.  But the Wii sport tennis only lets you play doubles instead of singles.  However the response to what you do is very good.  It reacts almost instantly to what you do and it almost always does it the way you intended.  Also, it almost never swings when you did not intend to -- and when you swing it almost always swings too.  Plus the kind of stroke you use is represented accurately. For example when you use a forehand it does a forehand etc.  In this game you can play singles but the responsiveness of the racket is poor in comparison to the responsiveness of the Wii Sport Tennis game.  For example, most of the time it represents a backhand accurately, but occasionally it doesn't -- this happens much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport tennis.  It seems to have more trouble with forehands.  Sometimes I swing and it doesn't swing -- this occurs much more frequently than it does in Wii Sport Tennis.  Sometimes I don't swing and it swings -- again, this occurs much more frequently than in Wii Sport Tennis.  Plus in Wii Sport tennis the response to what you do is almost instant.  In this game you often see it respond somewhat after you do your stroke and in a way that the programming of the character switches around after you do it.  They need to improve the programming on this game  a lot.  I hope future versions are better than this one.  Some of the reviews said they spent long hours getting used to this before they liked it.  You can get used to lots of poorly done things if you spend long hours using them -- but that doesn't make up for the fact that it was poorly done in the first place.  It is true though that if you play the net you can do better and win more.

I don't think this is a problem with the Wii Motion plus.  In the Wii Sport Resort there is a table tennis game that in many ways is similar to tennis in that the strokes are the same etc.  All of the games in the Wii Rport Resort use the Motion Plus.  The responsiveness to the strokes is instant and extremely accurate in comparison to the responsiveness of the strokes in EA Sports Grand Slam Tennis.  I think it is just that the programmers at EA Sports don't know how to program for the Wii very well.",Not responsive compared to Wii sport tennis
B00NW6T6CC,1.0,"Backstory (not a tl;dr)

I mainly use my mouse for work and not gaming. I decided to try out a new mouse as I just wanted to see what was on the market when my current macro mouse Logitech G600 has been working without issue for the past 3 years. I'm only trying out this mouse because it's on sale. I experiened none of the below issues on my mouse.

Hardware (Mouse) :

1) The cable, although a braided cable, is not a very nice one that folds easily or has much give especially after it has sat in a box. Folding and pulling on it to flatten it out makes it feel like you're going to break the cable. Some manufacturers loop their cables to avoid the cable from folding like this.

2) The feel of the mouse is great with finger, palm, and claw grip. The clicks are great as expected. The buttons are also very responsive and the macro buttons feel great and are the most accessible than other vendors especially if you don't have the largest hands. I wish there was a added weight option as the mouse is almost so light it's easy for it to leave the desk with a quick sweep of the hand. Scroll wheel is great and the side clicks with the scroll wheel have just the right, pleasant amount of actuation force.

3) I found that tracking on harder surfaces was somewhat difficult for this mouse even with calibration. Sometimes your palm lifs the mouse up when reaching for further macro buttons.

4) RGB colors are nice and it is great how you can change the colors per label, macros, and scroll wheel. No complaint here.

Overall, with the mouse feeling great and like particular vendors who cheap out on wires, you will get the feeling that they want you to become miserable with this mouse and upgrade to the wireless version to get the full experience.

Software (Razer Synapse 2.0) :

1) Synapse 3.0 is not supported with the mouse, which means you have no chance of getting past any issues you might find with the current mouse or software version. You are dependent on their support or updates.

2) There is no option to specify to open a directory directly. Batch scripts are required to accomplish this.

3) Specific Windows programs (snipping tool) could not be found by software even when I could prove that they existed by starting them from command line with absolute path. May be some sort of permissions issue, I gave up. Even batch scripts would not work.

4) Sometimes on boot, even after uninstalling and reinstalling the software, the software would not take over the mouse when the OS and Synapse loaded. I have no issue with this on my other macro mouse.

5) Certain macros would not work, again even when I could make them work from my keyboard, which is not Razer. Macros with the Windows Key (Win + 1) would not work. Macros that utilized the Shortcut Key in the program properties of any program such as (CTRL + ALT + 1) would not work.

6) There is no option to do a text block. Such as implementing passwords etc.

7) Switching between keymaps is kind of tedious and awkward. And although the keymaps ultimately work and I can see where they had some good design, the fact that the Windows key or other shortcuts would not work made it impossible to use the keymaps.

8) When it came to macros that actually worked such as copy / back / they work great. I believe for how much you would spend on this mouse they would add more features such as (next tab / previous tab) just anything more would have been great.",It didn't work for me

B004774IPU,1.0,"It only took me a few hours of playing this game in order to hate it. Ignoring the existential questions of whether hexes and the new stacking rules were good or bad (they still sound to me like a good idea), the problem I had with the game was that it's BORING. The interface just doesn't work as well or as efficiently as Civ IV. A huge amount of clicking is necessary to get past each turn, and the game moves with glacial slowness. It takes forever for the game to just start--you can't get past the intro movie. The enemy civs don't seem to do anything but sit there. And on my Windows 7 computer, alt-tab didn't work to minimize the game, which is extremely annoying.

If you don't already have Civ IV with the BTS expansion, then I highly recommend the Civ IV complete edition, which you can purchase for significantly less money (just search Amazon.com), and if you play with the BTS expansion pack upgraded to the latest version, it's DRM-free and relatively bug free, and an amazingly re-playable game which can keep you entertained for months, even years. There are mods available at an online fan site which make the game even better.

I say this as someone who has played every version of Civ, and it's not about being resistant to change. I never liked Civ III very much, but the first time I played Civ IV, it immediately grabbed my interest.

B0038N9WWS,1.0,"I am a big fan of shooters and this really is an aweful shooter.
First, There are no tutorials. It has you decide the level of difficulty and immediatly has you playing the first level. There is no way to accustom yourself to the controls or gameplay.
There is no control for movement. The game forces you in stationary position, taking damage and all you can do is frantically move your crosshairs back and forth across the screen in hopes you will pass it over your target. The crosshairs move very fast and you frequently pass your target without hitting it. There is NO target locking system. As you move the crosshair across the screen to the left, it bounces back on it's own, altering your aim. They could have fixed this with a quick-flick style locking/targeting option.
There are boxes and items to shoot for health and weapons upgrades but the auto-camera moves your view around for you and frequently takes you out of the area the upgrade or health was, while at the same time sends swarms of monsters at you, damaging you.
This is why shooters should not be played on a console. With a mouse, on a PC it would have been much easier to aim and stay alive. Even on the easy level, it was frustrating and not a lot of fun.
As for the graphics, for the 360 I expected them to be better. It was not up to the standard I would have expected.

After reading the PS3 firmware bricking updates (confirmed on the Nyko Web site), I unpackaged the Frontman for an initial-slash-last go round attempt at trying before trashing this would be paperweight. Surprisingly enough - when plugged directly into a USB hub, this controller worked without a hitch. (It did not, however, respond to being piggybacked to a GH5 wireless fob). Sensitivity, synchronicity remained consistent across several songs as well.

Advice sensically remains to stick to standard GH5 controllers. Still, if you've got a dormant Frontman lying around pre 3.1 firmware, it may be worth re-attempting a go.

But anytime I tried connecting to a server to play Team Fortress 2 - it would never connect.

B0000CCZT8,1.0,"Oh brother.
After eagerly awaiting to see what the N-Gage will be like, I get my hands on one and find it to be a tremendous disappointment. Let me put it to you this way: everything negative you've read about in all those videogame magazines is true. This is a device that should be marketed to the cell phone crowd, not the videogamers. Essentially, it comes across as a Nokia phone wrapped around a fancy new package, right down to the obvious ""cell phone"" screen.
It does several things, but unfortunately does none of them well. The games look great in presentation, but they are presented on a vertical (!!!) phone-style screen which is simply too small and produces too many headaches from eyestrain. The cartridge position is ridiculous, I hated having to perform surgery on the silly thing just to play a game. A strange idea, especially when you read Nokia's official explanation as to why the cartridge is ""buried"" inside the device which makes no sense. The menus and built-in management were both a mess. Talking on it is an issue all by itself: not only is it terrible to hear in public areas, but its downright embarrassing holding this electronic taco up to your ear! And who wants to splurge on a handset when the option to use it as a normal phone could have been made so much better?
Few games are available for it, but that's common. That's not my beef. The problem is that the system itself is simply filled with too many design flaws. If Nokia (obviously a phone company) REALLY wants to create a GAME machine and then market it as a GAME machine, they should have gotten together with an outfit like Nintendo to help them design it for gamers in mind. It's pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing. I seriously believe this thing was rushed out the door for Christmas, but the fact the Nokia refused to listen to early consumer complaints about it at showings doesn't support that theory.
Let me put it to you this way: I have a beautiful cell phone I adore (a Panasonic GU87), a minidisc player and a GBA. I'd rather have those three than this any day since I get far better performance and usage out of them as opposed to this thing. I took mind back and got a refund.

Again, not sure why it is still being sold when it cannot be played and why the sellers are not noting this in their product pages.  Here is a quote from one of the vendors ""PC Game complete in box with all contents - cds are in great shape and play great...""  Hmm.. CDs play great eh?  How?

B002DC8GKE,1.0,"IMO the core FPS dynamic of kill-respawn-kill was played out decades ago.  I'm one of the dissenters that detests the mindless, juvenile, trash talk frag fest of COD & Battlefield; I am always looking for alternatives.  I loved Borderlands (yeah, I said it) and lately I have been digging through the used bin for RB6 Vegas 1&2, GRAWF 1&2, Splinter Cell Conviction (phenomenal BTW) etc - the tactical, strategic, co-op with a purpose stuff.  Was hopeful for some of this in Brink.

Bethesda has dropped some real stinkers since FO3, FONV included (it was a 7/10 at best) and now Brink.  In short Brink basically uses repetitive, non strategic micro quests that force two sides to cluster in claustrophobic nooks of uninteresting maps.

- The levels are like small sized arenas death match arenas with zero draw distance.
- The missions are really brain dead i.e. go here and have one person press x to start a countdown while everyone defends said position, repeat.  Woohoo
- SMART - instead of a cover system you get a wonky and disorienting jump/climb ability (when it works that is)
- Guns/Graphics/Upgrades - nothing to write home about and don't make the game any more fun
- Incentive to level up = a new outfit.  Gee thanks, I love dress up.

This game is NOT in any way a COD alternative.  It's much closer to replicating the COD experience (i.e. repetitive, twitch, close combat arena frag) in a more team based structure.  In conclusion if you like COD I recommend you stick with COD, you will be disappointed.

Failures are poor crafting system, uninteresting dungeon encounters(you literally just want to get through it to get the xp or loot might as well get a second job), afk bots galore in PvP, unbalanced PvP, unimaginative garrison addition, ugly icons and quests for lackluster pet battles, bloated unmanageable economy, supposedly ""streamlined"" classes making them all depressing to play.

B00BXONG7G,1.0,"Not really caring much about shooters anymore and getting this and COD Ghosts as gifts, this game sure made it easy for me to decide which one to bother putting much time into.  All this on top of the severe early release bugs.

Aside from the need for loading Origin first, the game doesn't even launch then, but instead opens up options in a browser window.  It's extremely frustrating and difficult to find many basic options.  As well, searching for any kind of game will randomly choose a server, even if it's using an expansion pack you don't have.  You can't join it, it just brings a popup telling you to buy the expansion pack, and can happen many times in a row when searching for servers.

Once you actually pick a server, there's a severely long wait time to load up.  People say there's very little wait time if you have a solid state hard drive, but this extremely long wait time is inexcusable.  My computer settings are such that I can run everything on high settings as perfectly as a console.

Adding on to that, unlockables are extremely difficult to get---I've put in at least 2-3 hours of average gameplay in and not unlocked a single thing yet.  By that point in Battlefield 3, I'd at least unlocked the next level weapons in Assault and Engineer kit.  It's a seemingly callous ploy to get you to pay more money to get all the unlockables instantly.

As for the maps; except for Siege of Shanghai, they're unimpressive and overall dull.  The environment destruction is essentially unchanged from Battlefield 3, with greater level destruction either inconsistent or only working when you use tank shells, as rocket launchers and grenades are useless for bringing down pieces of structures.

The temptation to just uninstall this and go back to Battlefield 3 is all the more tempting given that the game looks exactly the same.  Even Call of Duty games change up the user interface/HUD and the font between each game---this one doesn't even do that.  If not familiar with the different maps and weapons, you'd never be able to tell the difference between BF3 and BF4.",An ordeal just to get to the game itself

The hot keys, even customized, required way too much time to even enjoy the game.  This game, in my opinion, is for people who enjoy complex playing, and not medium to simple play.

B000VNS9D6,1.0,"I am a big Lost fan, and was so pumped when this came out.  I'll keep this as concise as possible... whether you are a Lost fan or not, don't buy this game for any more than $5.  I can honestly say if I were not a Lost fan and just looking for an adventure game, or even thinking I am interested in getting into Lost, it does not possess the quality to stand on its own (or even with the Lost title boosting it) as a good game.

The gameplay was choppy, linear and convoluted. Any time you traveled into the forest you CONSTANTLY had to hide in the banyan trees to avoid the smoke monster.  This happened ALL THE TIME and also make you lose track of where you were, making any trip through the trees an extremely frustrating journey.  And how much fun is being on an island without really exploring the beach, the jungle, the various landmarks around the island at free will?

It's like you're put in a lush, enormous castle with 150 rooms, but you are only allowed to walk down the hallways, and once in a while, glance into a couple rooms along the way and wish you could go in there.

As far as the plot, I thought it was as original as they could make it, given the situation.  How do you introduce a new character on an island full of people all on the same plane?  At least it was somewhat convincing.  Add to that some Lost-worthy flashback action, and you almost have a game going here.

And just as it starts to come together (which is frustratingly quickly), the game ends.  With, I might add, an interesting and very Lost-like twist, but nothing makes up for how boring the game is.

Scenery and graphics, and (at least the attempt at) an original plot line, Lost: Via Domus gets a 5/5.  I do give props on the effort to replicate the scenery, again, something that was done splendidly and just added to my intense disappointment of failure in almost every OTHER aspect of the game.

Save games can get corrupted. Horrid clipping into walls by actors. Events

you did not trigger seem to happen anyway (causing you to reload hours back

 to correct it). Like the commenter above said, combat is horrid.

B004NRN5DU,1.0,"......Or I might have wasted 60-plus dollars on this bundle of frustration masquerading as a game.

I love computer/video games, especially RPG's (e.g., the Star Wars: KOTOR series, Fallout series, Fable series, Mass Effect series, Elder Scrolls series), and was excited when I heard all of the sterling reviews for this game.  I had heard about the extreme difficulty, but thought the ""most difficult game ever"" talk was probably hyperbole.

I could not have been more wrong.  I love a challenge, and do not like games that have no penalty at all for dying.  However, there is a fine line between challenging the player and presenting overly frustrating difficulty that saps the game of any enjoyment, and this game crosses that line within the first 30 minutes of play.

I can accept that bosses should be formidable enemies in a RPG, but when even lowly skeleton warriors encountered early in the game can decimate you within seconds, I think the game has gone a bit too far.

Beyond the insane difficulty, it seems the designers went out of their way to irritate the player: no ability to pause(?!), you can only save at campfires (and then if you do, enjoy re-fighting all the enemies you defeated that will respawn!), and often no clear direction as to where to proceed next.  I happen to think that features in recent RPG's like the ""Save Anywhere"" function and the ""Next Quest"" marker in Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas/Mass Effects 1 and 2, while undoubtedly designed to make those games appeal to a mass audience, are improvements to the RPG formula that make them MORE enjoyable to play.

To the ""hardcore"" or ""old-school"" gamers that love the unrelenting challenge that ""Dark Souls"" throws at you endlessly- more power to you, and if you think most games out there today are way too easy, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Dark Souls"" to you.  While I enjoy a FAIR challenge, I also view video/computer games as a way to relax, and I see ""Dark Souls"" as a game you FIGHT, not PLAY.

BTW: I am not certain it is a coincidence that this game does not have a demo on Xbox Live (at least as of the date of this review); one wonders if the designers are concerned how many copies of this game they might sell if most people had a chance to see just how overly difficult it is.

Finally, I have to say that I view an excellent RPG as being similar to a good book- one that gives the player a hand in shaping how a great story unfolds.  ""Dark Soul""'s story is almost nonexistent.

So, for those gamers on the fence about ""Dark Souls"" that have read the glowing reviews for this game: buyer beware- TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  As for me, I will wait for Skyrim and Mass Effect 3.",Thank Goodness for Redbox......
B00BGA9Y3W,1.0,"Normally I wouldn't write a review for games but destiny was so bad I didn't want other people wasting their hard earned cash

Not everybody knows that:
You cannot play this offline
You need a constant connection to the destiny servers which is very unreliable get ready for your game to be interrupted even with a good connection.
You need to reach level 5 before you can do multiplayer.
This is not a proper mmo like eve online
Despite all the hype prepares to be underwhelmed both by the lack of depth of the story or any real action do not believe the trailers.

This is not open world or sandbox there's nothing to explore you go on these dull missions kill someone then go back to the tower.
The enemy just spawn in the same place.
Also the story ends at the introduction and only gets mentioned every now and again

Story
I really wanted this to be good but alas it's just not worth your time an empty lonely game experience with a story that could have been amazing. If you're a story driven person I'm afraid like many online only games the main story just becomes a back story it's so sad.

Action
Also if you're not into level grinding then you may want to give this a miss as the enemy have main spawn points which they don't go out of and not long after killing all the enemy they will spawn back again.
The a.i's are not as intelligent as those used in say killzone or halo (throw a grenade at an elite he will try and commando roll out of the way not stand there like a moron)all in all they enemy are not fun to fight but pretty boring. The only interesting action comes from multiplayer but with that many better multiplayers' out there and more coming out again you'd better spend your money elsewhere.

Levels
As I mentioned the levels have nothing to explore in them if you're expecting something like skyrim or fallout 3 with a living world populated by interesting events, locations and npc's prepare to be shocked.
Take earth for instance you will have to keep going back to the same location for all of the missions so in real terms destiny is actually very small but this is the same for the other locations off planet.

Conclusion
At first glance it really seem's good but after a few hours play and then a few more you realize there is not actually a lot there in terms of story characters or action.
Don't get me wrong I love bungie but I just don't know where it went all wrong.(although from what I understand some of bungie went to 343 industries to look after halo maybe that's where all the talent went)

The reason for such a low score is because six months after it's release scalpers are keeping the price high, and there are many of these people around.

I couldn't get it to sync with the transmitter for the longest time. When I somewhat worked through those problems (after some colorful language) I discovered a new problem. When I was playing a game, the controller would randomly push buttons for me, or it would vibrate again for no reason, or it would walk my character off a cliff, thanks a lot! The other reviews sounded good for this controller, now I feel like I can no longer trust the reviews on amazon.  They were really wrong on this one, if they paid me $20 to take this controller off their hands, I would still feel like I overpaid.

B00140R0XK,1.0,"I received the item with great enthusiasm due to the good reviews above. However, as I opened the box (not the one from Amazon, but the actual Thrustmaster box) I realized there were small plastic pieces laying around. I realized the wheel was poorly packaged and therefore there was a crack on the plastic with a hole above it. Not big deal really, yes it was broken but I wouldn't return it just for that. However after I installed the drivers I realized (on the windows test screen) that the brake pedal is completely dead. I did my best around re-installing drivers, looking for updates for drivers, nothing changed (of course it wouldn't, the drivers were just right the first time).

Then to top it off, 2 out of the 3 racing games that I tried the wheel on didn't work right away. In both Need for Speeds the wheel was working fine through the menus but not in the actual race. So while I'm sure I could've found a solution with some research, I decided to re-pack the wheel and send it for a exchange due to the defective pedal and broken steering wheel plastic.

So yeah, I'll update once I receive the new one, however having a 1) Broken product due to Poor Packaging; 2)Defective Item, and 3)Not completely compatible even with good driver installation/update; pretty much covers everysingle thing that could go wrong with a product from the customer side.","Defective, poorly packaging caused dmg NOT plug&play for PC"

B0047TLIBU,1.0,"* Tentative review and FYI:

Well, I've just about had it with working with this gaming just to get it work.  I've invested probably 4 hours total now on and off trying to get this game to even do it's most basic function: run.  I have a non-cracked, perfect order ps3 with an internet connection, etc.  The game will boot up to the main menu, where I can tool with ""options, extras, downloadable content"" just fine, but once I touch ""New Game"" the game hangs at the loading screen.  Apparently this is not something I am alone with, with Bioware's message board filled with advice such as ""delete your old DA:O files, and maybe your old ME2 files as well.  Having more saves from DA:O could cause extra load time.""

Obviously not a good solution.  So I reinstalled the game data, ran the game, nothing.  Game still hangs at ""Run Game"".  So, I then tooled with what would work - i ""DISCONNECTED"" from EA's servers and got it to work, finally.  After making it through the first, maybe 15 minutes, the game froze.  This was due to my settings going to default, and auto connecting to EA's servers.  After this incident, the game now refuses to load or use the new game function again, despite what I do.

Well than I gave deleting old ME2 and DA:EU stuff off my ps3 may actually help, so I did so, and left only what I really wanted anyway in the form of saves.  Boot up the game, turn off EA servers, and then play the next 30 minutes of the game.. where it freezes again, for no reason.

I have an open ticket with EA for support, but apparently I am not alone in this boat by a long shot.  In this generation of gaming, you honestly cannot be coming out with console games that do not work, especially the signature versions. Essentially, if this game will not work, I am stuck with a very much devalued signature edition due to downloading my DA:2 EA PASS, which ultimately seems to be the cause of these issues.

EDIT: To those of you thinking this review is not a reiview because you assume I have no played through this game yet, pelease read my following response:

""I have played the game on the PC - I am on my second play through. First as a rouge on casual and now as a mage on hard. I'd still give the game a disappointing 65/100 for a multitude of reasons - but that belongs in the PC thread, not the PS3 one. I will bet you EA will have you shelling out at least 100$ for the game and all the decent DLC if you have the regular version - most of which is ALREADY ON THE FRIGGIN DISK!! (Paid 20$ for DLC for PC and 60$ on steam, so already 80$).

The PS3 is, thus, a game worthy of a 1/10. This is different the the PC game. I have owned nearly every bioware game on generally multiple consoles (ME1 on 360 and PC, ME on 360, PC, and PS3, DA:O on 360, DA:EU on PC and PS3, DA2 on Steam (PC) and PS3 - along with KOTOR 1 and 2 on Xbox and PC, and many others, even the failed MMO Warhammer).

So, as it stands, this is a legitimate review as this version has NO CONTENT and therefore is a horrible ""game"", but just a menu. I highly recommend the PC version and not the PS3 version and that was a main reason for writing this review.""

Update:  OK, I did some research, which I should have done first... there is pretty much no way to play this if you have a CD burner... the game thinks that if you have the software to burn cd's you'll try and make illegal copies of the disk!

B00005NZ1L,1.0,"Azurik reminds me a little of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter from years ago, except the premise is far less interesting and the main character is blue. Yep, blue. One of those ridiculous-looking Japanese Anime characters with tattoos and whacked-out hair. Worse, he appears to be made of a stiff plastic which makes him move with the realism of a Barbie doll. Seriously, he marches up steep hills without a single knee flex!
The textures are nice, but the animation quality in Azurik is very poor by today's standards. Those of you who are saying this game really showcases the Xbox should try a few more games. The music is a poor attempt at a movie score, and the creatures you have to battle are as dumb as posts. The birds that fly around are animated so badly that I burst out laughing. But worst of all, the controls in Azurik are so lame that you have to spend half your time and energy just managing (centering) the camera so you can see what's going on.
The bottom line? This is Microsoft's worst Xbox game, and if I were the product manager I would have pulled the plug.

B006JKASCK,1.0,"I bought a Vita with the free 4 GB card that was offered opening week.  It's enough to get started with, but something tells me more will be required.  Once I download Super Starburst Delta and Motorstorm RC, I'll have enough space left for a few game save files, and that's about it.

$100 for 32 GB is grossly overpriced.  I can understand why Sony does it....the hardware itself is sold at a loss, and they need to make that money back any way they can....but the prices for memory are currently an obscenity.  As a gamer, I can remember Sony fanboys screeching about how overpriced proprietary drives are for the Xbox 360.  I must wonder what those same fanboys are saying now.

I can get a 32 GB Micro SD card for around $30-35.  Sony is charging THREE TIMES AS MUCH for that same amount of storage.  This is simply not acceptable.  I plan on using and playing my Vita for as long as possible without buying any more storage until pricing is more reasonable....as in, say, $10 for 4 GB, $20 for 8 GB, and $49.99 for 32 GB.

B00005B8IX,1.0,"This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.
I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.
I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.
I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series.

B000MK694E,1.0,"Let's keep this sweet, organized and fair.

UNDISPUTED FACT:
BIOSHOCK will only install for a limited number of times (it was 3 but - after a deluge of eMails and bad reviews - it was upped to 5). So, if you install it you will be reluctant to uninstall once finished and will have to carry those 9GB on your HardDrive for a long time. On top of that, its resale value is down the drain the moment one pops the box open...
Even after the patch that removed the activation limit, uninstalling still leaves behind certain irremovable folders that will make sure it can be re-established in the future.
So one has to ask: even after paying $50 for it, WHO ACTUALLY OWNS MY COPY?

UNDISPUTED FACT:
The game utilizes an overzealous version of SecuROM 7+. They either activated all its available options or had a special version custom made. No other game company dared behaving in such heavy-handed way. This means that if your computer has more than one disc drive (or even one but non-DRM certified) it may block them, whereas the game may not even install if you are running virtual drives or have certain media-burning software installed (even NERO has been known to be considered ...""pirate-ware""!)

DISPUTED FACT :
It has been widely reported that BIOSHOCK installs a RootKit. Both MICROSOFT's ROOTKIT DETECTION TOOL and AVG ANTI-VIRUS detected either the RootKit or its actions. Recently, AVG was made to release a special update (just for BIOSHOCK) to ignore this alert.
In hacker lingo, to ""take someone's Root"" means to insert a procedure that ""will allow the intruders to maintain root access (highest privilege) on the system without the system administrator even seeing them"".
Official BIOSHOCK announcements (and their ""unofficial"" reviewers here at AMAZON) will try to persuade everyone who would listen that there is nothing there, so stop looking and don't even mention it.
Understandable reaction since, the existence of a RootKit would be a solid basis for class-action litigation.
Weight the facts and judge for yourself.

UNDISPUTED FACT:
BIOSHOCK effectively revokes our Administrator rights on our own computers. Here is what happens: even after completely uninstalling the game there is a mystery folder that canNOT be removed, no matter what!
On WinXP it is located here:
""C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\SecuRom""
As administrators, we could (unwisely) delete even Windows System folders - yet BIOSHOCK's mystery folder apparently claims a higher authority level? What this folder does and why should it get placed into OUR computers so that we cannot remove it even as Administrators, is beyond me. And I, for one, do NOT appreciate it one bit. (A quick internet search revealed a number of suggestions on how to get rid of it, ranging from clearly unsafe to catastrophic...)
True, almost every game leaves one or two folders behind after uninstalled - but this NEVER REVOKES OUR ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS to delete them!

I do understand that there are production and publishing costs to get recovered as well as profit projections to be reached. Companies that wish to protect their investment will always try to fight piracy. This is only reasonable and expected.
However, with BIOSHOCK, as it is currently available by 2K GAMES, it gets WAY OUT OF HAND & WELL BEYOND RIDICULOUS!!

No one in the game-publishing industry seems to learn from past mistakes: every security system eventually gets cracked and every ""OnLine activation requirement"" eventually gets bypassed. So, utilizing an overly intrusive, inconvenient and possibly dangerous security kit only serves in penalizing the people who actually paid good money for their product - and manage to shoot their sales in the foot at the same time.
Look what happened with HALF-LIFE 2: legitimate buyers still have to put up with activating the game every time we want to play - and of course VALVE paid the price: unprotected HL1 had sold TWICE as many units as STEAM-""secured"" HL2 ever did (8million and 4million respectively, Source: THE WASHINGHTON POST)

Since I would NEVER install a contraption such as BIOSHOCK onto my computer and wished to have hands-on experience before I reviewed the game, I asked around and a colleague of mine had already made the mistake of purchasing it and installing on his laptop.
THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME.
The environments are well designed and have a pleasant retro patina; the graphics are very nice, even though they do not meet the hype. They are comparble to older games such as HL2 (not to mention STALKER).
You see, dark is not always moody, and blurry cannot always be mistaken for dreamy.
I did love the music though! Both the collection of happy-go-lucky and Big-Band romantic 1940's songs (contrasting with the bleak environment) as well as their smart timing, added to the overall experience.

It was the gameplay I was the least impressed.
Totally linear - as it is has come to be expected from any FPS today I am afraid. To be fair, I cannot imagine a Single Player holding a storyline without being more or less linear (even ""free""-roaming FAR CRY did not escape this curse) - but then again, that is why I am not a game designer. And unless the publishers release their creative suffocation of the true game artists, there is no hope for a worthy successor to SYSTEM SHOCK 2.

The controls are not hard to get used to; if not, they are completely remapable; nevertheless, I would love to have an real inventory: cycling between which plasmid and which ammo for which gun can get pretty frustrating. Fast.
Not that hitting your enemies does any good. For a game that is based on an alternative reality scenario and counts in immersing you into that world, the damage dealt by the guns is pretty unrealistic. A double-barreled full blast with the (augmented!) shotgun in the head of a generic splicer will NOT take him down.
And what's with the scarce ammo!? I ended up using the 1-2 combo (electric plasmid shock followed by quick ...wrench hits) one picks up in the first 10 minutes of the game throughout because the ammo was either of the wrong type or too expensive or nowhere to be found. Only at the very end was there an abundance of both money and ammo but by then they were pretty useless: a fully charged electric plasma gun and some propelled grenades is all one needs.

And, finally: dying. Regeneration chambers turn the game into a check-point one - and I hate checkpoint-games. Most often than not, they are chosen in order to artificially augment the gameplay duration (having us replay the same segments over and over - instead of saving wherever we feel like it). Moreover, when progressing, you usually end up getting killed just before the next regeneration chamber (and having to repeat quite a distance from the previous one) whereas, when facing a Boss, regeneration takes away all the suspense. Keep respawning, you will eventually get him, his health does not increase if you do.

So, all in all, BIOSHOCK is a good game BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE WORTH ITS EXCESSIVE DRM TROUBLE.
It is only a slightly above-average game; and if 2K GAMES did not have the guts to publish it for PCs (and is hiding it within an intrusive security Kit) it should have stuck with Xbox.

Even BIOSHOCK designers acknowledge there is a serious issue with the security measures forced upon them by the publisher. These measures are hurting their game and, so, THERE IS AN UPDATED VERSION COMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO FIX THIS!
Don't take my word for it. Google for ""Ken Levin-Interview"" and ""BIOSHOCK-Fixed-Version"" and see for yourself. (I tried to add links but Amazon, apparently, does not allow them)

BIOSHOCK has it all: SecuROM 7, temperamental and Limited number of Installations, overzealous Drive-Blockers, possible cloaked RootKits, irremovable folders...NONE of which is Clearly marked on the product description!!

As it is, it will come NOWHERE NEAR MY SYSTEM!

I would advise waiting for 6 months, they will either clear it up or it will find its way to the clearance bins...Just last week I bought RISE & FALL: CIVILIZATIONS AT WAR for $2.99 (less than 8 months after its release) - and that nugget featured STARFORCE of all things!

UPDATE:
By now there are over...130(!) Comments on this Review (pages 1-2 & 9-10 are especially...informative). Over these weeks, there have been numerous attempts to suppress my review with either negative votes (that appear overnight in bursts - over...140 in the last three days alone!) or overly insulting comments - with my replies to them ""mysteriously"" receiving enough negative feedback to get folded as ""not helpful"" within minutes. The same happened as well to supportive comments posted by other customers.
When this was not enough, a ""shady character"" (who constantly changes her nickname) managed to become enough of a nuisance to have AMAZON REMOVE this review...TWICE(!).
Amazon decided to split the baby in half: it restored but kept from the first page no matter the customers' feedback. Not until the introduction of the Amazon's New Rating system was this review fully restored.

Even after the partial restoration of this Review, AMAZON's voting system is still getting abused in order to hide as ""not helpful"" comments posted by anyone else even remotely mentioning the serious issues of this game.
We can only guess what affiliation this individual has with the game publisher or SecuROM...

B017W16ZDK,1.0,"This product is way over priced or basically unavailable.  It is a discretionary purchase you don't need it you will survive.  As much as it sucks to not have a physical copy and it sucks, if you absolutely must play the games buy the digital versions for the reasonable price.

Edit:
I think it's fair to 1 star this product because because the game included in other ""special editions"" is exactly the same as the game included in the standard edition.  The standard edition of the product holds the rest of the game hostage as dlc, albeit for the same price.  But everyone railing against the 1 star reviews would in all honesty rather have the physical copies than the dlc.

Also most companies gauge interest in their ""special edition"" to decide how many print up so they're maximizing their profit.  Nintendo likes making collectibles because it creates scarcity and makes a product look more desired than it is.  It doesn't make Nintendo any money and frankly they under-priced it.  I'm okay with collectibles but it's a mistake for the cart in the ""special edition"" to be a collectible, basically this is Nintendo token backtracking and admitting it was mistake to split it into 2/3 games.  I know it's not a perfect analogue but they never created a Pokemon ""special edition"" side by side with the original release of the split games, those always came later and they weren't limited print ""special editions"".  If I was investor, I'd be angry with how much in additional profits they failed to capitalize on this.

If an owner of the ""special edition"" can honestly tell me they'd be happy not owning this version of game, so it can be a collectible for others, or think it's worth the current scalper price (because it isn't $80 anymore), then that needs to be in your 5 star reviews.  If the situation changes and an all in one cart becomes available down the road, I'll remove this review but right now it's the only version of this product and it isn't a good one for the above reasons.",Hold out for restock or suck it up and buy digital
B00J48MUS4,1.0,I'm so ashamed I bought this broken game for $60. This is by far the worst AC game i've ever played. It had potential but they messed it up. The graphics are so broken it's painful to play,I wanted to like it so much.
B018K6KV68,1.0,"I've come to the conclusion that there are no decent gaming headsets under $100. I add this to the list headsets that are a waste of money.

First, the cord on the headset cannot be plugged into the xBox360 (regular not Elite edition). Turtle Beach advertises that this works with xBox360 and Playstation but those are usually hooked to televisions, and many people own HD TVs now. We have an HD TV so we cannot use this with our TV for console video gaming ""as is"". (A Tritton headset we own comes with the cord able to be used immediately, not this Turtle Beach headset.) After researching this problem I found that non-elite editions of the xBox360 need an adapter cable that you must purchase separately. I shopped for that product and found two non-Microsoft items for sale on Amazon (under $10) but customer reviews stated for both that due to the design and size of the inputs on the non-elite xBox360 adaptations would have to be made using screwdrivers, a hammer, and for one of them, a soldering iron. I read that the Microsoft cable costs $50 but was unable to find it for sale on the Microsoft xBox360 website to confirm. I was hoping for a headset that just plugs in, period. I note that with the HD TV you need both the HDMI cable for the video and the other outlet for the audio, that's the issue. The price of the official Microsoft HDMI dongle is $50 full retail (that adds a lot of cost to the lower price of this Turtle Beach headset.)

Second, These begin to hurt the ears and head after one hour of use.

There is high sound quality which is nice but if they hurt or are not compatible with your TV what good are they? There are other nice sounding headsets on the market.

Our family decided we'd use it with the laptop when watching homeschool lectures, online driving school lessons, listening to music with the laptop while doing other work with the laptop and using for gaming while on the laptop. However after an hour, there is pain, so I can't recommend this headset.

I recommend that you buy a high quality headset and treat it with loving care, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRITTON-Pro-5-1-Surround-Headset-for-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Black/dp/B00B1MVNDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround Headset for Xbox 360 and PS3 - Black</a>. Just spend the money on a high quality item and don't waste your money buying multiple cheaper headsets that you will ditch in search of a decent one.

B004NBZBME,1.0,"I purchased this via Amazon and it loaded fine! I just bought a new pc and this was a very good game. The story line was impressive and while I found the controls a bit awkward, I soon found that not to be a problem.

Then, my new pc had an issue and the techs told me that I needed to refresh my system. Not an issue as I could surely re-load this. Yeah, right.

I was able to get my pc up and running and decided to reload Homefront. When I put in the purchase code, I received a ""Duplicate Record Error"" and it suggested I contact Steam. I did contact them. This proved to be nothing more than a lesson in patience. Their customer service and support is simply a series of emails. You do not talk to anyone. I sent them all the data I had about the purchase from Amazon. This was fruitless.

As a result, I simply gave up. Steam's support is simply designed to frustrate the user until they simply give up. That was my take-away from all of this. As a result, and I told them this when THEY closed my ticket out, that I would N-E-V-E-R purchase another Steam product again no matter what. It is not worth the aggravation. No offense to Amazon's Customer Support but they were of no real help either.

I liked the game. It had moment that were very intense and again, the story line was excellent. But! The support from Steam was anything but supportive. As a result, I would warn you NOT TO PURCHASE STEAM PRODUCTS AS THEY DO NOT SUPPORT WHAT THEY SELL. If I could give this 1/2 of a star, I would.

B004774IPU,1.0,"I have been playing Civilization since it was a board game.
I loved Civ II (on my first computer) and Civ III.  Alpha Centauri was great!
Civ IV was not really an improvement although the graphics were nice. All these games grabbed me.  It was always, ""Just one more turn!""

Now let me say:  Graphics are nice but some of the best computer games have had lousy graphics (or none at all!)

Civ V was apparently designed by the marketing department at Firaxis.  It was reviewed in computer magazines who wanted to cash in on the advertising.  Anyone who wrote a good review of this coot (it doesn't deserve to be rated a turkey!) probably got paid to do so.

It took forever to install, and took two tries to complete. It crashed the first time.

When I tried to play the cursor got lost and didn't point to where it was supposed to.  The game crashed so often I started saving after ever turn.  It took so long to build improvements that I wanted to reduce the population to slavery.  Apparently they had all gone to work for Firaxis and spent most of their time on office politics instead of production.

Sloooow, slooooow, crash. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I have seen this happen before. Someone writes a very good game that is immensely successful.  Then there is a sequel that works well, because it tweaks some of the weaknesses of the first.  But as the thing grows the bean counters and marketing departments take over from the creative people.  Marketing likes graphics (They don't know squat about games!) and so the game becomes nearly unplayable and more aggravating than fun.

I have seen a few favorable reviews, but they must have come from people who work for Firaxis.

As far as I can tell, Steam is just a tapeworm.

B0009351P2,1.0,"When the word came out about Marvel Nemesis I couldn't help to feel this could be a very promising Marvel game.  Who wouldn't? The press release (yeah I should know better) made it look great:  15 or more playable heros from several camps not just one:  Avengers, X men, Spiderman and the Thing.  So far so good.  The team EA put together to produce this game looked good on paper also.

Could this be the game that put some of my favorite Marvel comic heros to life on the screen with a good story line, clean graphics and player models, good sound and a great combat/fighting engine?  NO. NO. NO.  This is nothing but a brilliant marketing plan that made a few investors some money before the word got out that this game is terrible.

I honestly tried to give this game a chance.  I tried it for several hours and it was the biggest disappointment in something that had all the potential to be a great title.  If you feel like making a few snickering rich guys richer buy this game so they can take even more more money with them all the way to Switzerland while laughing that they duped you bad.

DO TRUST the reviews out there online.  Most of them tell the truth about this game.  But before bought it I found ONE review from what appeared to be an old schooler like me.  He like me didn't want to spend countless hours memorizing key combos and moves.  He wanted to get in the game to play as quickly as possible.  He like me didn't want to comb through a player's guide for hours before starting.  It made sense.

But heres the truth:

Graphics are horrible.  What are these people smoking that give the graphics for this game 4.5 out of 5?  From even the online mainstream reviewers.

Sound:  Not bad

Playability:  Worthless.  Repeated scenes.  Camera mechanics are horrible!

B004VQENY8,1.0,"It's so sad because this is really a great game with so much fun for multi-generational play. Unfortunately you can't play much of the game without throwing more and more money in to it.  What an obvious and pathetic money grab from Activision!  All of the game is right there on the disc yet if you want to actually play it you must buy figure after figure which are at least $10 a pop an higher.  Also, even though the little USB portal has a certain little cool factor it gets REALLY annoying having to change characters all the time to play certain phases of the game.  Plus, what's going to happen when that little portal ceases to function or the figures no longer register with the portal?  The game will be useless!  But I don't see why Activision felt the need to come up with such a convoluted system.  Oh yeah, money, that's why.  There are also bugs in the program.  If you get to a certain level and talk to a certain character then you must start all over at square one.  Also trying to coordinate the Wii controllers with the characters is very much a juggling act.  There is no simple way to assign a controller to a character so frequently family members are having to switch around controllers and getting tangled up in the nunchuck wires.  This game is kind of a great idea that turned in to a hot mess.  I say if you have $600 to spend to fully enjoy the game then go for it. The base kit cost is just the beginning.  Otherwise you're going to feel the squeeze from your kids and Activision to get any enjoyment out of the game.  To be clear, the starter kit is HIGHLY inadequate to enjoy the game. You will be spending MUCH more money in the end.  Shame on you Activision and this will be the last game we buy from you.","What fun, what a MASSIVE price tag!"

B0083KX9YS,1.0,"First off I've played stronghold games for 10 years, so I'm no noob. I'll make it quite simple, it's a piece of trash, you pay to win and nothing more. Let me put you in perspective for you, in order to train pikemen, build a wheat farm, make a fletcher guild, and build decent stone castle. You have to spend at least 16 full hours on research and resource collecting, not actual building time mind you. The game goes 24/7 so your castle will most likely be attacked while your asleep or on vacation. You can however buy ""premium tokens"" which will run your castle while your off line.

Here is the actual math: If you pay 8 dollars on crowns, that will keep your castle running without you for a month, and you can get two card packs. Now lets do the math: if you play this game for 6 months and you spend 8 dollars per month, you will have payed 48 dollars. If you pay 8 dollars per month, for a year, it will be 96 dollars.

That's just for a player who wants to do okay at the game. If you don't, most of your castles will have unrest and be captured by other players. I've just covered ""premium tokens"", bored yet? It gets better, if you want to get ahead of the lords around you, and you don't like waiting around, and you don't have skill, this is the game for you! You can buy bonuses that include free research points and an instant research. A.K.A ""cards"". The single thing that ruins the game. Basically you can spend 80 dollars worth of cards, and have the the same castle, rank and soldiers as the free player who has worked on the game for 8 months. Bottom line cards are broken here is a video to show you http://youtu.be/Pmnt8nJu1o0 you can search ALL over the SK forums and find videos like this. These are free troops that you can buy with REAL life money and put in your castle. Cards make the game a terrible experience for new players.

If you want to try this game here is the absolute truth: it's very addicting, has terrible graphics, is all about politics, you will waste HOURS of your life, and you pay to win the game. And btw you will never win, they'll always be someone who buys their way to the top and kills you, even if you play non stop for 4 months. There is absolutely no skill when it comes to this game.

Steering control is very unprecise and encourages crashes (crashes are spectacular if that is all you like).  There seems to be no way to smooth out the steering.  I use a Logitech G25 steering wheel which has all three pedals and 6 speed shifter.  GRID does not allow me to use manual shifting, only bump up and bump down.  Control adjustments are minimal.  There is no practicing here, you are thrown directly into a race with no idea of what the track is like.  The spectators cheer as you go by, which I think is silly and unnecessary.  I wish the designers of this game would have concentrated on improving the driving experience instead of encouraging crashes.  I think the designers of the game are more interested in impressing themselves with nonsense than making a good racinag simulation product.  I am very disappointed.

I *LOVE*&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto-3/dp/B00005O0I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>&nbsp;(for the Playstation 2) and I wanted a game that would be similar to it. I know that no game, except for possibly GTA4, could even come close to GTA3, but I still wanted ""more."" From what I read about this game, it seemed like a poor man's GTA3. I had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driver-1/dp/B000034DMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driver 1</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PC/dp/B00001W0J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PC</a>, but could never actually play the game itself because I could not pass that stupid driving test at the beginning of ""Undercover"" mode. When I read that Driver 2 did not have a driving test, that gave me even more reason to want it.

GAMEPLAY

When I popped the game into my PS2, I immediately went into ""Free Ride"" mode so that I could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit. I didn't even move one inch when the cops were after me. Yes, that's right, I was STANDING STILL and the cops were on my b-u-t-t. If the cops are going to be on me like white on rice, I'd at least like to know WHY. I gave the cops no resistance, allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out (like real cops would, and those in GTA3), but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me!?!

Since this game lacks the Police Bribes and the Pay And Spray of GTA3, the only way I could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter (the equivalent of GTA3's Wanted stars meter) was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that I could lose them. Even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one, since you can't get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wanted/chased, there's no practical use of this ""feature.""

I decided to try the main ""Undercover"" mode, hoping that it would be better. The first mission was simple enough. Get from point A to point B. The first time I tried it I failed it because I didn't get to the place on time (I was going the wrong way from the start). Once I figured out that all I had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance I could, I got to the destination with time to spare. Mission 1 Passed! Perhaps this game WOULD get better ... until Mission 2, that is!

Mission 2 involves you having to follow another car. The problem is, unless you're (at most) two car lengths behind him, the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission ... even though his car is clearly visible on the screen! After attempting this mission three or four more times, only to get as far as around the corner, I had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my Mom's receipt to get a different game. ANY game would be better, even Barney The Dinosaur!

Not even cheats codes could help make this game playable. I used two Game Shark codes to unlock the in-game Invincibility and Immunity (no felony) cheats. However, neither of these would help with mission 2. The Infinite Time Game Shark code would not work, otherwise I *might* have had a chance of barely playing the game ... the key words there are ""might"" and ""barely.""

GRAPHICS

This game has the WORST graphics ever seen in a video game of any age. Pong and Pac-Man look high-tech compared to this.

There is more pop-up in Driver 2 than in a marathon of Pop-Up Video on VH-1. You look ahead and see an open piece of land. You plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down (or just to take a shortcut). Just as you get within a car's length of that land, a building pops up out of nowhere. BAM! You crashed and damaged your car. Repeat indefinitely and you've got the graphics of Driver 2.

REPLAYABILITY

In order to have replayability, a game must first have playability.

TO BUY OR TO RENT?

NEITHER!

I wouldn't even give the CD to my dog as a chew toy.

If it were possible, I would have given this game a 0 rating. Then again, it kinda deserves the 1 because it has one redeeming quality: it makes a great coaster!",A Game So Unplayable You'll DRIVE Back To The Store To Return It!

B00438VWRU,1.0,"This game is a ripoff of professor Layton but does a lazy job doing it. You pretty much just click through a bunch of pointless talking because they needed to put a ""story"" then awkwardly get put into a puzzle for no reason other than the game needs an active play mode. In the game mode you usually solve some kind of mental puzzle similar to prof. Layton puzzles, however, they do not give you and directions as to what the goal of the puzzle is unless you choose to get a hint for reduced points. Since when was directions a clue?
Also, it seems to have the same single track of music play on repeat over and over. Even if you get this game for 5 bucks or less you won't want to play for long.",Lazy rip on Professor layton games.

B000NJFMRE,1.0,"I don't know who they made this game for but it wasn't the 4 -5 year old. I thought since this game was about Shrek it would be suitable for little folks. It isn't. There is something about the camera angles on this game that may even the simplest task difficult. The game mechanics stink!

My little guy ended up trying to do a simple task (climbing boxes) and fell down so many times I had to do it for him. Did I succeed? No!

The perspective of this game is odd and you can't really tell how high you are jumping or even figure out where you will land. End result, mounds of frustration.

It's almost as if the developers had a weird sense of humor and made the game control as difficult as they could.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game for players under the age of 7 and I don't even know if they would be able to play it.

Horrible game!",Game is too hard for pre-schoolers!
B00I19TXIM,1.0,"So I realized games for the 360 has two wrappings around it, but this game only had one wrapping. Either the game is off or someone tampered with it.

So I thought I would leave this review so people can see some of the cons of it.",Disks don't work
B00VMB5V96,1.0,"The flaws in this game are myriad in number. The most prominent is that you can pay $100 and not be able to come close to completion. You only get three characters and you cannot even complete ANY of the free play with these characters. All you get is story mode, three miserable adventure worlds, and only three red bricks. This games is not even really that much bigger than all the other Lego games that have come out in the past 3 years, and I have played all of the them so I know what I'm talking about. The worlds on Lego Dimensions are so small that Minas Tirith is only about fifty feet away from Hobbiton in the Lord of the Rings world! To those who are wondering if they should buy this game, I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price of this partial game. Lego Batman 2 has a Gotham City free world which is much larger than any world than this game has. The Middle-Earth of Lego The Lord of the Rings is at least three times bigger than this game's version. Lego Marvel has a large free world New York and in Lego Batman 3 you can visit all of the Lantern Worlds. Furthermore, in all of these games, you can buy all of the characters, complete all of the free play, collect all of the gold bricks and red bricks, and complete the game to 100%. The best part is that you can buy all of this for less than what Lego is now charging for one INCOMPLETE game.  People have said that this game is worth $100 and more , but I would say that several complete Lego games that are still perfectly fun, entertaining, and valid are worth FAR FAR more. I would spare anyone the expense of this game in favor something cheaper and just as lastingly good.

A flaw that I see in the Starter Pack is that legos come with it. The legos alone that are involved send the price out the roof. At least with other games you could choose whether or not to buy corresponding legos, and if did want to then you could pick and choose which ones to buy in relation to how much money you could afford to spend at the time. I am not against the legos that come with this game. I just don't think you should have to pay the extra expense just to receive the game. The old system of buying legos and Lego games separately is better and definitely a lot cheaper.

When someone completes this game to 100%, please comment on how much it costed to do so.

For further entertainment, check out the older LEGO games that came out on the PS3 like LEGO Indiana Jones, LEGO Batman, and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga. Although these games do not have open worlds, flight, and other things that the newer games have, it is their simplicity and fun that made LEGO games popular. They cost about $20 each.",I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price ...
B000E0XX9Q,1.0,"The original NWN was buggy on release, but this game is so buggy you may not even be able to install it.

Wait a couple months (or more) for the game to be fixed is my recommendation. The recommended minimal requirements are no where even close to what you'll actually need to run this game at an acceptable level, so consider getting it after next years hardware upgrade.

The game will certainly be worth purchasing in a couple months, but stay away for now and help force the devs to fix it. I'm shelving it and will update my review once it's fixed enough to play.",Hold off on this game

B000088KH4,1.0,"This game is the worst game I have played since Land of the Dead: Road To Fiddlers Green. To start, how can this game get a decent grade for controls!? Its TERRIBLE and BROKEN!!!!!!! To aim down-sight you must press the LEFT STICK!!! WTF!!? And not only that, but you have to effin hold the thing!!!!!!! And since the control sensitivity is a default ULTRA LIGHT SPEED FAST, it is IMPOSSIBLE to aim. Jumping is left trigger... yeah, wtf!? Additionally, to switch weapons you must hold the RIGHT stick in and open an inventory screen in which you freeze your character in place and leave him open to be attacked and most likely killed.... on top of THAT your guns are atrocious in aiming... you will literally, I mean L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y shoot circles around the soviet soldiers. ON THE SUBJECT of Soviet soldiers... these motha flippins take SOOOOO many shots that not even the marvel super hero Hulk could survive... gotta calm down.. back to the controls. Eventually you get to lead your rebellious New York soldiers, so ""Y"" tells them to go to one spot (if you hold down Y then the entire team goes to the spot while just tapping it sends ones soldier), pressing ""B"" tells them to defend one spot, and ""X"" tells them to regroup.. sounds easy right? well its NOT!!! I guarentee you will find yourself pressing X to reload, but wind up calling your men back... what IS the reload button you ask? HAHAHAH! There is none, you actually reload if you don't shoot for a handful of seconds. Very awkward if there is a break in an intense fire fight yanno? Its like... *RATATATATATATATA...reload automatically while enemy is standing there shooting you*

Lets talk about the AI and the bugs plauging this lackluster game. Theres a SERIOUS chopping issue within Freedom Fighters, where enemies can shoot through and run walls, appear out of thin air, or just never stop coming. Ontop of that you can stand in front of an enemy for about 5 minutes (yes I did time this) before they go ""Holy **** thats an American soldier!"" and shoot at you with 100% accuracy. Then comes your partner AI.... when it comes to shooting enemies they are okay, but they DO NOT LISTEN TO YOU!!!!! Numerous times have I told a soldier to stand in one spot only to see him run off and get slaughtered. OH YES I FORGOT TO MENTION: a LOT of the time, your soldiers will run towards fences that are suppose to basically be a barrier for the end of the level or a barrier to make you find another way around and actually run right through it.. I swear to Buddha.

I think the story and how they pieced together the missions were probably the only good part of this title. Basically, the Russians beat the United States in building the first atom bomb, nuked Japan and forced its way into Europe seizing control of the continent. From there they moved into Cuba and then one day attacked Manhatten, NY. Moving on, each mission affects another one. For instance in one mission labeled ""The Bridge"" you must use TNT to blow up a bridge, but you must clear the stage, then go back to the stage ""The Hotel"", pick up the TNT while heading back to ""The Bridge"" and then use the TNT on the bridge which will help the people from the ""Firehouse"" stage to sweep through. I thought that was kind of cool... but thats it.

A combination of horrendous controls, disgusting music, glitches, bugs, atrocious AI, and punishing difficulty make Freedom Fighters one of the worst original X-Box titles I have ever played. How in the name of Zeus did this game get a 9.3? I honestly do not see it.",worst X-Box game in a long time...

B00178630A,1.0,"You probably already know by my rating that I am not impressed by this game. Maybe I should qualify this with a ""yet."" I think they are trying to fix things, but they have done so many things wrong so far that I just can't give this game a good rating. I have been plagued with problem after problem.

I have two copies of this game. My girlfriend and my best friend both bought me a copy without speaking with one another. It was very sweet. Well, I also have two computers that can play this game. One is a custom built computer and the other is a Mac. Well I convinced my girlfriend to play with me. The only problem is... well, we couldn't play the game together. Why, you might ask? Well, I could install it on my Mac just fine. There was no problem other than the considerable lag. I had to drop the video settings of course, but there was just constant lag.

No, I couldn't play with her because there was an installation problem on my PC. It took 3 days of troubleshooting to finally figure it out. You know, uninstall, reinstall, re-download the client. Run as admin. Run in XP mode. Nothing worked. No I had to manually kill the agent.exe process and manually start the process from within a folder before I could actually run Diablo 3 and install it. That made it work. None of the other stuff like updating my system, disabling my anti-virus, running in compatibility mode or anything made this game work. So, Blizzard, you failed big on this one. 3 days without being able to play.

What was my next problem? Oh, the constant lag is a constant problem. Updating things like my network adapter and reworking my wiring didn't fix anything. Checking my channels to find the best reception didn't help. It still lags.

The first few days the servers were constantly down. The auction house IS constantly down. The servers are still constantly down for some kind of maintenance. They threw this piece of crap out onto the market before ever really doing much. This doesn't feel like 12 years of planning and thinking for a new game. This feels like some piece of crap game they put together in about a year.

Then about a week in my buddy gets hacked and loses all of his stuff. Seems odd, but didn't surprise me too much as he isn't too big on passwords. I knew that. Oh, but a few days later my account gets hacked. Then I am in the forums noticing that there are a lot of people being hacked. Then another friend was hacked. Does this really sound that common to you? You think people who have been gaming for years get hacked this easily? No this was a Blizzard problem. Did they help me out? Sure.. in a way. Let me tell you how they helped me out. First, it took 24 hours to even respond. Then it took another 24 hours for them to let me know that I had to make sure I understood what a ""rollback"" was. How insulting to my intelligence. Then they finally rolled me back after another 24 hours. They didn't offer to give me any gold or help me out in any way. I was out millions of gold in items, 150,000 gold in definite gold lost from the roll back, a day lost on a character that I was working on, and the lame moderator just makes some snarky comments and says it's all taken care of now. Meanwhile the items I did have depreciated badly because the economy changed so quickly. I basically lost 3-4 days worth of game time and all kinds of other things because Blizzard is compromised. I made some suggestions for their security, but I am sure it fell on deaf ears. They just want everyone to use their authenticators because they assure everyone is 100% impossible to hack. Bullcrap. I'm not even saying it was impossible to hack me before, but it shouldn't have been easy.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I see some changes coming that might make the game worth swallowing in some ways. There are still tons of problems. They are firm on not letting people go ""free world"" in the game like Diablo 2. You have to select a quest and go from there. It's tedious. The farming is tedious. The game is tedious. There is no more rushing really. The leveling is boring.

I'll be honest. I would have been happy with Diablo 2 with a few changes in there. I wanted similar characters and play styles. They took powerful characters and a fun game and made it tedious.

They were even so arrogant as to point out that ""there is no cow level"" on loading screens. Oh, you mean one of the funnest things in Diablo 2 isn't in your game anymore and you think that is a good thing? Oh, let me shake your hand. Then there is this new unicorn level that they make ridiculously tedious (noticing a pattern here) to get into. I haven't even gone into it yet, because I don't feel like trying to farm the 5-6 different pieces required and the 100,000 gold item to make the level and not gain anything from it other than maybe a few giggles while slaughtering a unicorn.

So far the only words that can describe this game are ""epic fail."" Epic fail Blizzard.",Blizzard Failed
B00W8FYEU2,1.0,I was really disappointed with this purchase primarily because I can not play it online. The offline components easily bored me and made me wish I had waited to pay twenty dollars for this. While the game play is okay and the graphics are great they took out some of the most fun elements of the PS2 Xbox geneation Star Wars games. I'm giving it one star primarily because I can not really do anything with it.. There should be an online only sticker on games with no in depth story campaign. It might have been fun if they let me play the multiplayer maps in single player mode. If I had tried it beforeI would have returned. I really regret this purchase.,No internet access reduces the fun.
B00178630A,1.0,"I was a HUGE Diablo fan back in the day and have been waiting with barely-contained excitement for this game to be released. Only a decade between installments... let's all collectively hope that Diablo IV comes along sooner than 2032.

The game itself is cool; the physics is great, the environments and immersion, the sense of force and motion. Obviously it is the proper 2012 rendition of the classic. Although they didn't really change up the formula much (shortcut keys on the keyboard, mouse control, hack and slash RPG dungeon crawler), it definitely has lots of little ""oh neat"" features and designs. I hope the developers never read this, because of the level of effort that clearly went into making this game, but I could only really give it a 3/5 for fun because... it's not different enough. It's like the 2004-2010 Jaguar XJ. When it came out, all the critics said, ""technologically brilliant, high quality, beautiful, but... at a glance, is it really different than the last two generations?"" So it goes here. And for whatever reason, the story line so far is kind of schizophrenic, generic, ""old stuff, magic, old stuff, magic"" recipe. In a way, the simpler, dumbed-down stories in Diablo and Diablo II made them somehow more eerie. Here it's just hard to appreciate how so many people lost staffs, hid keys, broke swords into pieces, and how many distinct but equivalently pathological evil magic people/creatures could be working so hard to execute some kind of evil plan. In the original(s), there was a bigger bad guy, a boss, and you had to off him before you kept going. No strings attached, no frills.

Now where the other two stars disappeared: DRM. Battle.net ruined this game. I didn't even play it on its first night. I never experienced the ""can't connect"" problem. But what you find when you play is that you HAVE to go online and sign up for battle.net, regardless of whether or not you have any intention of playing cooperative games. Strike one. Then, you have to sign in with your credentials before the game starts (and can't even save your password... seriously? Is a gamer profile really so important that you can't store your password on your own computer if you want to?)... strike two. Strike three is: if you sit idle in the game for 5 min. or so, battle.net kicks you off and your game ends. Next time you log in, your game reverts TO THE LAST CHECKPOINT. There is no way to save your state. You can quit the game before you get up, but that ALSO reverts you to the last checkpoint. Occasionally you can lose 10, 15 minutes of progress in a larger map, especially if you're trying to explore every corner. So what you do is, get up and go do what you're doing as quickly as possible. I also occasionally keep going by the computer to unpause then re-pause the game just to keep it from kicking me off battle.net.

Additionally: wait until you experience the pleasure of a laggy connection or over-loaded battle-net server. Your client shows that you're swinging at a baddie again and again and again, but not hitting it... while they're striking hits on you. Wait until you get a laggy connection in the middle of a huge fray with tons of monsters and your screen freezes and drops to 0.5FPS. Wish you had control? Wish it was actually just running on YOUR computer, since you're playing single-player? Oh yeah, you bet. So you just get hit, and killed, and re-start, and hope the lag goes away after a few more re-spawns, or if you stop and re-start the game.

This shortcoming is just horrendous, unforgivable. Nobody in product development or QA could have gone through that and said, ""OK, no biggie, the typical player won't care."" This is not only a poorly-executed feature - it's a huge DEFECT, and a MAJOR mistake on behalf of the product people. Single player isn't single player. If you're connection is out, you don't play. If you're on the go, you don't play. If your connection is laggy for any reason, you don't play.

Seriously. Let me play offline. Let me play on my laptop in the car if I want to, or at a cafe without an internet connection. I shouldn't even have to be online at home to play. I shouldn't have the game kicking me out every 5 minutes when I'm just getting up to get the kids something to eat or change a diaper or whatever.

So my 1-star rating is actually a 3-star rating for good gameplay (maybe even 4 stars if your expectation really just was for an updated version of exactly the same recipe, no surprises), minus two stars as a punitive measure for hobbling the overall experience so badly with the damnable DRM.

B000EXW52O,1.0,"This game is a mess.  It looks to have been designed for the XBOX 360 and ported to the PC. Playing with a keyboard and a mouse, it's next to impossible to get anything done. Target lock doesn't work--you lock in a target, and the game loses the target a couple of seconds later.  Getting a torpedo lock is next to impossible--your ship must have to be lined up EXACTLY with the target to get a lock, and then the lock is lost before you can even fire.  Switching to an XBOX controller is a slight improvement, but not much.

No save points except for between missions, you can't choose the enemy's ship(s) during a skirmish, controls can't be reassigned without hacking into files with a text editor, space stations break up into a few huge spinning chunks when destroyed.  Graphics are adequate, but not as good as they could be for a new release.

I've uninstalled it from my PC, and am waiting to see if Bethesda/Mad Dog finally puts out a patch that fixes the game.  The 1.1 and 1.2 patches didn't do it.

Concept: 9/10
A Diablo Clone for the Xbox 360!  (Ported from the PC Version)  Hack N' Slash Fans Rejoice!!!

Story:  0/10
With text like, ""Kevin got GOOB'D for wearing Pink Spandex at the gym!"" or ""This grave is for concept art that didn't make it into the game.""  I can honestly say that no attempt was made at even creating game fiction.  It's like the game was written Mad Libs style by angsty 12 year olds on forums.  The voice acting is horrible and full of unfunny jokes that you'll hear 100 times by level 15.  There is no excuse for this.  So, I guess the story is, ""You kill stuff to level up so you can kill more stuff.""
- Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.

Graphics:  3/10
This is a top down Hack N' Slash game which features 20 enemies on screen at a time, so the graphics are never really that good in these types of games.  However, the super-saturated backgrounds actually gave me a headache / eye strain.  (Out of 51 Xbox 360 games, this is the ONLY one to give me a headache.)  The backgrounds are so bright, it's very difficult to notice visual differences in the enemies.  The game also lacks style.  World of Warcraft is saturated but it has a stylized art direction.  Sacred 2 feels like the brightest generic world of all time.  When you really think about the graphics, it's almost impossible to believe that Mass Effect came out on the same system 2 years ago!!!  The graphics in this game are passable at best.
- Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.

Interface Screens:  5/10
Navigating through the screens is really cumbersome and awkward at first, but if you really want to try, you'll eventually get the hang of it.  Too Human does a much better job with interface screens.  After you figure out where everything is, they're not that bad.
-  Some Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.

Bugs:  7/10
There's some slowdown, poly tearing, crashes, dead enemies glitching, and interface bugs.  This game is really sloppy.
-  A few Hack N' Slash Fans can overlook this.

Bad Ideas: 8/10
No Pause in 1 player!!!  No game fiction!  A laughably bad opening movie!  Worst Voice Acting for a 360 game!  Confusing Inventory System!  Once you assign your Stat Increases, you can never change them...
-  It takes a very special breed of Hack N' Slash Fan to overlook this.

Gameplay:  8/10
If you didn't immediately take the game back to the store, and you actually tried playing it for about 2 hours, the game starts to get fun.  The Character Customization and Enemy Loot Drops are great!  You're constantly fighting hordes of bad guys and they're dropping things that you can actually use every 15 to 20 minutes.  There are also socketed weapons to further your customization.  You level up fairly quickly, so you're always looking forward to what's coming next.  Each time you level up, you get to increase 3 things:  Character Attributes (Strength, Dexterity...), Skills (Tactics, Swords, Speed), and Special Attacks (Hit Multiple guys, Hit one guy, Energy Leech...)  So, once you get hooked on the game, it really gets addicting.  The Loot in this game is on par with Diablo 2 and may have an edge over Titan Quest.
-  This is a Hack N' Slash Fan's Dream!

Combat:  7/10
For this type of game, the combat is ok.  You map weapons to the face buttons on the 360 and press them to attack enemies.  You can also hold them to repeatedly attack.  It's pretty simple.  Potions are mapped to the D-Pad, which feels awkward, but you can get used to it.  There is no cool down period after taking a health potion and you can carry a ton of them.  With 99 Health Potions, you're pretty close to invincible.
-  Hack N' Slash Fans hungry for some console action can appreciate this.

Level and World Design:  6/10
The dungeons are the smallest dungeons of any RPG that I've ever seen.  Some are the size of an apartment and hold 3 enemies.  Other dungeons are a series of linked rooms connected by a very short load time.  The World is also a bit strange.  You could be in a very easy area, then walk through a field and suddenly get ambushed by some very powerful enemies.  There really isn't a clear distinction of when you're entering into a tougher area.  On the positive side, the world is HUGE!!!!!
-  Hack N' Slash Fans don't care about worlds, they care about enemies, powers, and loot!

Good Ideas:  7/10
At any time, if you are encumbered, you can ""Scrap"" your excess loot and instantly turn it into gold.  It's a nice feature that prevents you from having to drop a ton of items.  Mapping Combo attacks to the Face Buttons is also a good feature.  You can change difficulty levels as you're playing!  The Character Classes all have a unique feel to them.
-  Hack N' Slash Fans can appreciate this.

Overall:  4/10
This game has a ton of problems and you really have to overlook quite a bit in order to have fun.  As a result, I really can't recommend this game to the majority of gamers out there.  However, if you are dying to play a Hack N' Slash on the 360 and you just want to level up and customize a character, then you can have a lot of fun with this game.

EDIT:
1 Star overall because of all of the problems, poor graphics, glitches, and an epic fail regarding game fiction.
3 Stars for fun, simply because getting loot is addicting after a few hours of play.

The game is Rated M for... no apparent reason.  It should be T for Teen.

Buy this game if you can overlook a ton of faults and you really want to hack and slash your way through a massive world full of enemies for hours and hours.

There's no reason to rent this game unless you can keep the game for as long as you want.  This is a really long game and you won't be able to finish it in a week.

Avoid this game if any of the faults that I listed above were 'deal breakers.'  If you can't get over these things, then you'll be taking the game right back to the store.

If you like Sacred 2, you'll probably like Castle Crashers on Xbox Live.  It's a hack and slash side scroller, and it's fun!  You'll also like the Marvel Ultimate Alliance games from Activision.
If Sacred 2 isn't your thing, but you want a great RPG, then Fallout 3, Oblivion, and Mass Effect are some of the best ever!

B00SHXKC8M,1.0,"Firstly, I loved the very first Borderlands game.  The addition of Handsome Jack was an utter failure of story line by Take 2 Interactive.  It is a story line that left my bored, without an option that I would choose.  If I could have killed Handsome Jack in the first few minutes of the story I would have to stop the annoyance he is.  The loot system is complete garbage.  It was better in the first game.  You could actually progress your equipment fairly quickly and choose the equipment that supports your play style.  This loot was revamped horribly and ruined the looting system.  You will spend 90% of the game unable to use the equipment you like the most.  It is that frustrating.  SO, having bad equipment with bad loot, combined with a bad story line, and average cartoonish graphics earns this poor rating.  A terrible continuation of what used to be a good game.  Skip this one.","Bad story, bad loot system, average graphics, and bad characters."

B005NH6NMY,1.0,"I got this for about $80 or $90 when it first came out (around 2013 I think) to play Forza 4, it did work but the handling just didn't feel right and I could not get the suction cups to stick to my smooth wood table so it ended up just being stored in my closet until about a year and a half later when I decided to use it on my PC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and other racing games. But almost immediately I started having problems with the pedals getting stuck and keep in mind at this point the wheel and pedals haven't been used more than 3 times since I've had them, I had to take apart the pedals and the plastic had cracked so the spring was over to the side making the pedal catch on the plastic, the construction of the pedals is beyond pathetic and a very poor soldering job with the cheapest wire you can find. Since then I've had to take apart the pedals NUMEROUS times to fix and readjust them, the pedals are so lite I've even had to add some heavy bolts as weights to keep them from sliding around on my carpet.

Other complaints I have is that the pedals (aside from being very cheap and too lite) are placed way too closely together, the wheel is only 9"" wide and is very stiff ruining the experience and ofcourse the suction cups however other than that I haven't had any problems with the wheel itself. With the quality of the wheel and pedals I wouldn't pay anymore than $25 for it brand new.

My advice is if you're looking to buy a racing wheel for your kid to play Xbox don't buy this, you'd be better off buying the official Microsoft wheel and be done with it because this one has too many major flaws, it's NOT a great value.

For PC gamers looking for a budget wheel I'd give this a pass, more than likely you're going to want the most realistic racing experience and this can't give you that, for about $150 you can buy a used racing wheel with force feedback, I'm going to try the Driving Force GT because I've read alot of good things about it, it's marketed for PlayStation 3 but has Windows PC drivers to work on PC.",Spend a little more and get quality

B004XGN8W4,1.0,"Firstly ignore the score and read what I have to say. I bought this product on Amazon because i wanted a console on-the-go. As far as doing that, it seems like it is an accomplishment. The screen does show a strong 720p image, and it keeps the Playstation 3 very secure in the Straps. You can use this for mobile gaming...the issue comes in when you try to use it for anything more than a quick fix on the go.

Now lets get into it. I'm going to imediately point out my model was ""defective"" as the screen was suffering from water damage. I contacted support (their only support is by email) and they responded in roughly 20 hours by saying that some models suffered water damage during the natural disaster in japan. I wanted to get my money back as it was unusable, they told me send it back to amazon first, and if they won't take it to return to them second, and they have a return policy set up with Amazon. I did Amazon's exchange program for the first time and my second model came. This was a hassle and most people might quit here and say the product sucks but im fair. The second product came in and also had water damage, but to a much lesser more manageable degree. While the first had severe water damage mid-screen, the second model had minor water damage along the top of the screen edges in the form of bubbles lining the entire top portion of the screen. It only shows through white and grey screen making PSN games like Flower annoying and bothersome. The screen itself is crisp 720p but the viewing angles are very bad. You will need to adjust your chair a certain way, generally looking straight forward at the unit gives you the only working angle, where it doesnt end up too dark. PS ONE games can be unplayable unless you use the highest brightness and contrasst, the settings on this thing are really wacky and the screen itself (other than it's hd imagery) is low quality and they definately cut corners. There are ghosting issues and the screens very thin, pressing on at all it WILL cause physical pressure damage. It seems to hold everything sturdy and work well for gaming, scratches are either all over the screen boarder and unit or at a minimum its a gamble when you buy it. my first defective unit had scracthes all over the screen boarder, this one has none. All in all it works for portable gaming if thats all you want and are willing to go through multiple units if it does have water damage (it sounds like most do) good luck as it seems to be a crap shoot. If you are using this as your main gaming machine and are bothered by craftmanship defects such as screen bubbles, scratches, and difficult viewing angles, you will want to buy a regular TV. Since this product is fairly cheap i'll recommend it to those looking for a cheap way to play games while traveling and that's it. its a one star for anyone else, because of defects, poor lighting and viewing angles, and general cutting corners to keep the price low If they worked on making a better product and upped the price it would be better, but they didn't want to charge higher prices, so that's how it is unfortunately.

having to keep a unit because i don't feel like jumping hoops that has minor water damage lining the screen, and fumbling with bad viewing angles isn't what i should have to do at all, so i cant recommend this product to most people... but as i said it does do what it is suppose to do other than that. its a 720p hdtv in a suitcase.

I also wish they had a number for tech support, email only is bad, although they do respond and are helpful. I feel very limited here, so whatever they tell you in email, goes. your best way to get your money back is entirely through amazon so their tech support most likely won't be needed.","my completely unbiased experience with this product, suffered multiple defects and craftmenship is questionable"

B000W91YTA,1.0,"First of all I'd like to mention the fact that I owned the original Xbox for years until now, to me, it was the greatest video game console I have ever played (being a videogamer since the Atari 2600 times). It had great games (Battlefront, Ninja Gaiden, Prince of Persia trilogy, etc) and cool features and so far I had not even thought about moving to 360 since I still had pending games for the original Xbox. That changed when it was announced that Ninja Gaiden 2 would be released exclusively for the Xbox 360, me being a huge fan of the original Ninja Gaiden and given that Xbox games can be played by the Xbox 360 console, decided to sell my old unit and order the new 360 so I cold get Ninja Gaiden 2 when released on April.

I ordered from Amazon the console on January and it arrived on the 27th, everything seemed to be in place, I came to love Forza 2 and played a little my old games, I really didn't use the console that much since my newborn son wouldn't allow me to. Things started to go wrong when Ninja Gaiden's release date was moved from April to May, then from May to June. Amazon would do a great job informing me of the changes (as I had pre-ordered the game) and ask me if I still wanted to buy the item given the date change. I then decided to buy a 360 game to play and utilize the new features of my Xbox and I got Call of Duty 4. The game was terrific and I quickly became addict to it, I then started to use the console more often. About three weeks ago, I came home from the office and turned on the console, the disc tray made a strange noise and there seemed to be no disc on it as the dashboard had the `Open Tray' text in it, I was almost certain I hadn't removed the game so I checked, the game was indeed in the tray, the console would simply not recognize a disc in it. I tried CDs, DVDs and other games and got the same result, no disc was recognized at all and the tray made noises every time I opened/closed it.

The console had a warranty note asking you not to go back to the retailer in a case like this as they may not be `as well prepared as their technicians' and contact their support center instead. I did that and after waiting on the line for a while a person finally answered, I had to struggle with them as they could barely speak English, since I do speak Spanish I tried to make it easier for the guy, I don't know which part of south America they're from but even in Spanish I had a hard time understanding what he was saying and had the guy repeat almost everything he said. This person asked me to contact my supplier first and see if warranty applied (even though the warranty info on the box asks you to go to Microsoft first), the reason for that he said, was that the supplier could simply change the unit and provide me with a new one. He told me I could mail them my console to fix it, but if that were the case, it was likely that they would simply replace the disc drive with a used one, if the console need to be changed, they could mail me back a refurbished one at the risk of it being an older unit without the features of the one I purchased (of course, had I purchased their extended service contract they would `gladly' send me a new unit free of charge). After spending $349 in a videogame console and with only 1 month of use I found this unacceptable and could not believe a Microsoft representative would tell me that. I went into the Xbox 360 official website and was able to find document number 910798, which explained some potential resolutions to my problem (none of them mentioned by the rep I talked to on the phone), none of them worked and the last option was to submit the console for them to check it. While surfing on their site I found that there are so many users having this and so many other problems that made me wonder if I wanted to keep the console. After telling some of my friends of my experience I found out that most of the ones who own an Xbox 360 have had problems at some point and have had to mail them to be fixed (one of them has had to ship it three time already)

After all these problems I simply decided I did not want to keep the console, Amazon would accept the return after their 30-day return period but would refund an 80% of what I paid. So I shipped the unit back to them and am waiting for my refund. So far, what should have been a better gaming experience has cost me $70 I will not get from the return, $59 of a videogame I will not play anymore, $19 of a battery I had to buy for the control, $30 of the shipping charges and my old Xbox unit. You'd think that after paying all this money for their product you would expect quality (not only of the product but their service as well); to me this was nothing but a waste of my time and money.

I'd like to think I simply had bad luck but after reading in their own web site I can tell they are having lots of problems with these units, my dad who is a sales manager at a retailer store told me customers return these consoles all the time.

How did the Xbox turn into this? I don't know really... Word of advice, if you already have the old Xbox do not sell it (I regret I did with mine) and if you're thinking about buying this, reconsider your options and think if this is what you want.",My experience with Xbox 360

B000FQ9QVI,1.0,"Many associate the Mario games with fun. I associate the name Mario for one mediocre platformer from the 80s/90s and a load of marketing hype and crazed fanboys.
There's no real story, the weak and uninteresting main character has no personality, the platforming has been done better before, all the ""innovations"" - most of them eon-old rehashes - feel forced, no sense of completion can be gained and the ""fun"" the game radiates seems false.

B00Z7V9P8K,2.0,"This game is horribly disappointing. The hallmark of the series has always been its terrific, class-leading combat system which, when combined with all of the cool stealth tactics it offers, creates the feeling of being Batman. All of these elements are there, but they are interrupted by the horrendous batmobile missions, which cannot be skipped, and which feel completely out of place in the series. It cannot be overstated how badly these sequences disrupt one's enjoyment of the game's core mechanics. The batmobile controls are mediocre at best, and it's tank combat and climbing abilities are just tedious.
 The story, as someone who has never followed the comic books, does nothing to grab me and make me interested in the Batman universe. The graphics are pretty good, but the game seems to run as 30fps, which I guess is the sad reality of this console generation. The gameplay outside of the batmobile is as wonderful as ever...which makes it so enormously frustrating that it is constantly being interrupted by driving/tank combat missions and the ubiquitous AAA Hollywood style cut scenes.

B0016BVY8O,2.0,"I like to collect DS games that are comprised of a nice assortment of mini-games, such as Touchmaster and even The New Super Mario Bros. But I have to say I was a little disappointed with Carnival Games for DS, despite it's good reviews.

The game is cute in style, and creative in concept. You fashion your character to your own liking, then have him or her wander around a carnival from booth to booth where you play games and try to win tickets. If you get enough tickets you might even unlock a prize which goes into your collection of clothes, shoes, hats, and accessories. The collection delivers some interesting clothing/accessory items, and some of the accessories even have special abilities--for example the radar gun zaps you up into a UFO and drops you off onto a different part of the carnival grounds. But there really isn't much else to do aside from trying to complete this collection.

Some of the games were okay, but none that I really had any desire to play over and over after winning both prizes, even just to accumulate tickets. Most of the games were ridiculously easy to master, while some  were a little difficult, and a few just downright frustrating. There were also a few secrets that didn't take me long to figure out that got me some rare items to add to my collection--but still nothing that made any significant changes in the game itself.

If you can find this game for about half the cost of what you would pay for it in the store then I say go ahead and give it a shot. But I just feel like it was a bit of a waist of money for me to only have played it less than a week and already put it down for good.",mediocre collection of mini-games
B002BSC54I,2.0,"ok first the combat system is absolutely awful!!!!. some enemies have very certain strikes you have to do and the wiimotion is just not advanced enough to do this reliably in battle. the whole combat and moment system trips over itself alot more than it should. theres a reason combat drones in the real world are flown w/ a joy stick and not a wand, because its far more efficient and precise, as a result in this game flying controls move between being under responsive and over responsive which makes it very annoying @ the least. the wiimotion + has to be re-calibrated every 30min. and it usually happens at the most inopportune time. this is the only game i have for this system that has to be re-calibrated so much, the other games maybe once in like 10hrs.

i realize the wii controls are not really meant for advanced combat systems, but other games have pulled it off very well like metriod prime 3. smart decision would have been to add GameCube controller compatibility. also things are added just to showcase the new motion sensor like putting 3d shapes into doors instead of keys. who cares! i not playing the game for novelty stuff. im playing to advance the zelda story and have some fun. since ocarina of time which i finished like 7 times, i haven't finished any of the titles that came after more than once and this one is even worse. i find it to be tedious and i kinda don't care, and thats not a good sign for a series that u follow for over a decade.

graphics were typical zelda(cartoonish like), its not xbox graphics but i don't expect them to be and they were fully acceptable. soundtrack... idk ...nothing really stuck out for me, i guess it was fine. story is ok so far, didn't get to the end yet so i cant fully comment on that. and i don't know if im going to finish it, its losing my interest fast.

Deadly Dozen Pacific Theater is VERY similar to the Vietnam game: the sounds, the scenery, the game play, even the names of your squad. That was really disappointing to me.  I was hoping for something different. Also, the AI (your squadmates) often get stuck behind fences or in buildings (even though you issue an order to follow you). When that happens, you have to switch to their character and walk them to the location of the rest of your squad. This didn't happen in the Vietnam game.

I felt that the character voices and the narration were much better in the Vietnam game; and the missions were more refined.

I played Deadly Dozen Pacific Theater for about an hour, and then I decided not to finish the game. I'd rather replay the Vietnam game.

If you're looking for a good WWII game, then check-out the Call of Duty or Medal of Honor series.

B00MYTSDU4,2.0,"EDIT: After several months of owning this mouse, I feel like I need to make an adjustment to this review, as well as lower the stars from 4 to 2. I cannot recommend this mouse to serious CS:GO players.

I didn't have any hardware failure or problems, but I've realized that for the first time ever, my palms and fingers are actually sweating during gameplay. At first, I just assumed it was an external factor, but after some research I've found that this is a common complaint. The problem lies with the thin plastic that the mouse is made of, and the rgb lights underneath. The combination of the mouse internals and lights start to get warm during use and causes this your fingers sweat a little. A thicker plastic would help insulate this better. When you start to sweat, the rubber grips on the side become slippery and useless. The only way I could combat this was to wash my hands with dish soap to rid them of oil, so my fingers could grip better. But about an hour later, my fingers would start to slip again. I then replaced the grips with a rubber that is normally used on handgun grips, which improved my hold on the mouse. But after about an hour, my hands would begin to sweat and my fingers and palm were warm. Note that my hands never sweat when using a mouse. Turning the RGB lights completely off helped a little, but I feel like that kind of defeats the purpose of buying the Chroma to begin with.

I just cannot recommend this mouse to anybody at this price point. I'm disappointed by the quality when I compare it to other similar gaming mice. Sure, its comfortable. But not worth the money at all.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I'm pretty picky about mice, because I play CSGO with a pretty agressive claw grip, and it's tough to find mice that are actually comfortable. I've been using a Logitech G9x for the past couple of years and I've loved it's small size in my hand. But for years, I've always wondered what a Deathadder felt like. So I picked up a Deathadder Chroma and a big XL Corsair gaming mousepad, and decided to give it a couple hours of testing. Here are some of my thoughts.

Pros:

- This is one of the most comfortable mice that I've used. The shape makes you assume it's more of a palm grip mouse, which is what kept me away from trying it for so long. But I was pleasantly surprised when I realized it has a much higher arch than normal mice, which makes a claw grip very comfortable.

- Chroma lights are actually cool and not gimmicky feeling like on the regular Deathadder. I can turn them off or set them to a neutral white or yellow and it looks fantastic and less ""gamer"". The colors are very nice and much better than the LEDs in my Logitech.

- Buttons are very clicky and satisfying sounding.

- Aesthetically, this mouse is a piece of art. The subtle flaring on the mouse buttons and the matte finish are awesome.

Cons:

- For the price, I feel like they should have used a heavier duty plastic, with a heavier grain finish. The mouse looks really good but if you tap the top with your fingernail, it sounds hollow and the plastic feels cheap. I felt like I could kill a man with my G9x, where the deathadder feels much more delicate. This is my biggest complaint with the Deathadder, but it's not too bad. I feel like Razer should make a premium wired version of this mouse and use heavier materials, and use different switches under the mouse buttons for a more tactile feel.

- Rubber sides could have more grip, like the SteelSeries mice. It's not bad rubber, it just has a softer feel instead of a gripping one. I see it wearing away quickly. Also the side buttons lack any kind of bump or grip on them, and I wish they had some rubber on them.

- No DPI switch. A mouse at this price point should have one, even if it's underneath. I play with really low DPI on CSGO and it's a pain to have to manually switch profiles in Windows back and forth.

Overall, I really like this mouse. I didn't think I would ever really like a Razer product, but this is a solid mouse choice for pretty much anybody. My biggest gripe is the fact that the build quality and materials aren't up to par with Corsair and Logitech (mouse is plasticky and cheap feeling). I see this mouse wearing out quickly, unfortunately. Hopefully Razer will release a better quality version by the time that happens.",Build quality is lacking and RGB light heat causes sweaty hands.
B00009X3SY,2.0,"The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.

B0002GTFIK,2.0,"It is a rare event indeed when I manage to play halfway through a game (20+ hrs) and then have to quit because of the overpowering desire to destroy my PS2, the controller, and my entire living room furniture setup out of sheer rage and frustration. I say rare, because most trash games are lucky to get a few hours out of me before they get flushed down the toilet. I'll admit, reluctantly, that I tolerated the first part of the game. So when did the honeymoon end? Wow, where do I begin?

-Story. To put it simply: it's dull. Aside from the initial medieval planet you start on, the rest of game failed to provide any form of intriguing plot. Once the giant SPACESHIP OF DOOM appeared and starting blasting things with laser beams, I yawned and lost interest. Most of the story is cliched, and that which is not tailors mostly to the Star Trek crowd (of which I am not a fan).

-Characters. The characters you control are lame and annoying, with Fayt being the worst offender by far. ""Gee Cliff, I don't see why we can't just give that big dragon a big sloppy kiss and huggity hug so that we can all just live in glorious peace and harmony. Do we have to kill it?"" Never mind the fact that you just polished off 5,000 of his brothers and sisters in that cave you just trekked through, Fayt you moron. The other characters aren't as bad personality-wise, but they're just as verbose. Yada yada yada. Be quiet.

-Dialogue. Mind-numbing. Like someone else said in their review, most of this game is dialogue and cut-scenes. You know, if a company is going to make this much of a game dialogue, then why not make it any good? God, I just wanted the characters to shut up already and go eat an blueberry or something. You're not philosophers, you're monster hitmen. Go do your job. Suffice it to say, this part of the game probably accounted for 15 of the 25 hrs I put into the game before ending the trauma altogether. Too much talking about a boring story and not enough action.

-Battles. By far, the most irritating part of this game. Granted, it was unique for a few hours, but it quickly got old and stale. Why? For several reasons. 1) Enemy difficult is woefully inconsistent. You'll be blazing through one dungeon, killing enemies in 3-4 hits, and then in the very next dungeon, enemies take 50 hits before they die. I remember spending 2 hours in one area, raising mad levels with my Triple EXP bonus gauge activated, only to walk into the next dungeon and have the first group of enemies use me for toilet paper! WTF?! Bosses are the same way: ridiculously easy in one battle, and near impossible in the next (without at least 10 attempts). 2)Enemies use a paralysis counteract if you hit them when their fury is full. This wouldn't be a problem if enemy Fury actually DROPPED when they attacked like your players' do. I'll be lucky to get in one hit before CLANG NOW YOU'RE PARALYZED. The enemy would usually follow up with a hit that took 100 hp off my my 2500 hp total, and my bonus gauge would break, citing a Critical Hit. Yeah, that's a critical percentage. Fun. 3)Gone are the days when just losing all your HP would kill you, now you have to friggin' worry about your MP too! If it hits 0, you die! Hooray! My favorite part was in one cave where this one enemy used some vortex blade attack and killed off two of my high-level characters immediately (each had 3000+ hp full up), mainly because the attack removed MP rather than HP. Screw you. 4) Enemy AI is cheap and stupid. They simply use the same powerful attacks over and over again. Same goes for the lame bosses. Your characters are wailing away on some boss, lost in some 30 hit combo, when all of a sudden ""FIRE BREATH"" happens and all your characters and blown across the screen, with half their health gone, nearly dead from MP loss, and no fury. Probably confused or poisoned too. Rinse and repeat, and you have the general battle experience provided by this game.

-Exploring/treasure. I remember in the good ol' days when exploring was productive and finding treasure chests was actually *GASP* enjoyable! Why? Because actual TREASURE was found. I think out of the 1,000 chests I managed to open before quitting, 950 of them contained some form of freakin' berry (used for healing purposes). Completely sucked the fun out of exploring. Why can't you give me more weapons!?!

-Items. Yay, I can only carry 20 of each. Umm why, considering I use 5 of them after every battle. Nice.

-Inventing. So dumb. Just how complicated must you make this process? It would be nice to have potential inventors clue you in as to which item they are looking for and where they are, rathing than spewing some more SO3 plot-garbage that means nothing anyway. Hooray, Cynthia is available to recruit! So where is she, and what do I need to do to get her? WHO KNOWS, NO ONE IS GOING TO TELL YOU! Why not even a little hint?? Oh I get it, ""difficulty"". Right.

-Hidden things. This reminds me of the more recent final fantasy games. You have to complete 10 off the wall, ridiculously hard tasks just to get one weapon, or one inventor. Sure, I'll win a bunny race 100 times in a row to get this one inventor. Why on EARTH would you want to do that? How on EARTH would you even know to DO that in the first place? It's like they want you to purchase a strat guide with the game. Thieves.

-Battle trophies. Stupid and not worth collecting, seeing how most of them are earned from completing mindless and outrageous tasks such as ""Win 5,000,000,000 battles"" or ""Win 3,000,000 battles without getting hit"", and when you do collect enough of them, the rewards are poor. Costumes for a battle mini-game. Yawn. New difficulty level. Oh wait, do I get to play the game on a NEW, HARDER difficulty level? Oh boy another 40 hrs of absolute frustration and poor design awaits.

-Puzzles. I just love trial and error puzzles. It's a good thing too, since this game is full of them. Sigh. This category also needs to include the ""where do i go next"" puzzle, where during a cutscene, a character will mention off-hand where you need to go next, and I'll miss it because I sneezed or something, and then I'll have absolutely no idea where to go. And townspeople won't even help me! WTF? How about a world map that indicates your next location or goal. Novel!

I remember 10 years ago when games used to be fun, and not a chore. You know, you can still have difficulty in a video game without making the player suffer through some overly complicated battle system, fighting enemies for hours on end because the stupid things won't die. If only the developers would take a little time to adjust the flow of the game-- start off easy and progressively get more difficult, but never too difficult as long as you're leveling at a reasonable rate. I want my games to move at a brisk pace, only slowing down when I choose to level or complete a sidequest. Don't make me spend 5 hours fighting enemies to gain enough experience to raise another TWO levels so that maybe ONE of my characters can survive a boss battle. Is that too much to ask?

Lastly, let me end on a positive note. Thanks to the glorious idea that is ""Playstation greatest hits"", this POS was only 19.99. At least I didn't pay twice that for this dog.",Frustrating on too many levels
B00001ZULE,2.0,"I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game.  The graphics are not really anything speical.  It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life.  The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly.  The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence.  The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys.  I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself.  The missons seem a bit vague and you think ""okay... what the heck do I do now?"" too often.  When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault.....  Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first.  If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter.",A Decent game if you're in to army stuff
B000ZK6950,2.0,"This is not a great game.  It's not even a good game -- just a solidly mediocre one.  And who has the time and money for mediocre games?  After the towering glory that was Resident Evil 4, I anticipated a nigh religious gaming experience, and that was what I should have gotten.  And yeah, before you get all ""you expect too much"" on me, I'll tell you this:  if you don't expect a *hellaciously* good time from entertainment software that runs fifty-to-sixty bucks a pop, you're either eating dodo sandwiches and blowing your nose on Franklins, or you're waaaaay too easy to please.

Okay, before I go into my grievances, here are some positives:  I like the basic zombie shooting, punching and kicking.  The two-player mode is a terrific thing to put in an RE game, and the ability to revive your dying partner if you reach him/her before he/she sinks to the ground is really cool and dramatic.  Firefights with gun-wielding soldier zombies later in the game are often fun -- I was surprised at that, actually.  The female characters are really cute, and it was good to see Jill Valentine again (though I don't like how they narrowed down the womanly hips she sported in the Gamecube Resident Evil remake).

Now my grievances:  Most of the maps are boring, confusing, and don't usually support the gameplay mechanics very well -- it seems like they're either too big or too small.  With the exception of one in which you help Jill out whilst avoiding an invincible Wesker, the boss battles are all phoned in, the big, wriggly snake beast encounters being some of the lamest.  All the characters are as *blaaah* as they come, personality-wise; they just say the same dumb, flat things over and over and over again, things like ""I should have killed you years ago, pesky, foolish hero!"" and ""Hey partner, we're partners to the very end, right partner?"" and ""What are you talking about villain?  You're mad, mad I say!""  It's alright to say stuff like that here and there in any action game (or movie, for that matter), but not all the rootin' tootin' time!  And why did they turn Chris into such a 'roid monster?  Sure, he was a big, tough guy in the other games, but jeeez!  And one last thing:  the African setting wasn't exploited to even near its full atmospheric potential (unlike RE4, which takes place in rural Spain and has European gothic fLaYvA to the MAX).

Don't tell me this game is at least as good as RE4, because it ain't.  I went back and immediately replayed it after beating RE5, and it is just so much better.  Better gameplay, better graphics (yeah I said it, alright; they're not as shiny and hi-res, but they ARE better), better characters, better story . . . it's just better.  Buy that, if you don't have it.","Pains me to say it, but . . ."

I continued playing, hoping that the rest of the game would be worth the problems. It wasn't really... I guess if you don't mind steering with the touch screen, and weird controls, go for it. But I wouldn't recommend it.",I couldn't finish it...
B001C3N0RY,2.0,"I love HOG games for the stories and graphics and the casual puzzles. This one was well rated and affordable, so I figured it was a good choice. But this turned out to be the type of HOG that I don't really like.  There is practically no voice acting and not much effort put into graphics or atmosphere.  The puzzles are either the regular HOG, fragmented, or spot the difference. The puzzles are timed, which I am not a fan of, and the scenes are the cluttered nonsensical type with objects strewn about and varying in proportion/size. You can use the pointer as a magnifier but can't zoom in like in other (better) games, and even with a magnifier, the resolution of the objects is pretty bad and hard to distinguish.

The biggest flaw is that it is very picky about the pointer location, so even if you see and click the object, if you're off by a pixel, it doesn't count -- and errors are a time penalty. It might work with a mouse on the PC, but it can be tricky to hold the pointer still with the Wii remote, especially within the seemingly minute parameters.

I'm sure some people like this type, but it really doesn't seem worth paying a Wii game price for it. You could get a better game for your HOG or adventure/puzzle fix.",Not the best HOG
B00ZRZTT3W,2.0,"This game is not awful but the learning curve is incredibly steep. Star Fox Zero utilizes gyroscope controls which aren't as bad as other games with forced motion-controls but the issue here is one of visibility and maneuverability. Vehicles like the Walker and Landmaster are very slow and unresponsive while evasive maneuvers can also feel really finicky to pull off properly (Sometimes I get rolls to work fine, others it takes a few tries). When it comes to visibility, cockpit view doesn't have any kind of radar so it's impossible to see threats if they aren't directly in front of you. In third-person view, the targeting reticle is incredibly unreliable unless you can get a lock on. Other more common problems with the controls come from the seemingly constant need re-calibrate your controls though luckily, this is easily done by pressing one of two buttons. There is a tutorial of sorts and there's also training missions but neither are too useful unless you chose to continuously go through them time and time again.

Controls aside, this is a pretty standard Star Fox story; if you remember Star Fox 64, it's essentially a retread of that with some details being changed or expanded upon here and there. The story is fine and can be ignored really since the core of the game is essentially an arcade shooter in space. Visually, this is the best looking Star Fox game on the market at this point and there is a good deal of variety when it comes to planets and even areas of space that you visit. Enemy designs are pretty familiar if you're a fan of past games which is nice too and boss enemies are also interesting from a design perspective, even if they're a pain in the butt to fight.

Overall I find it really hard to recommend this game. I've played this game for about 7 hours and the last 5 or so have been primarily out of spite. There is satisfaction in success but I feel like the game would be much easier to play and indeed, much more enjoyable if I could just use a normal control scheme. I don't hate these gyroscope controls, in fact when compared to Skyward Sword or Metroid Prime Trilogy's awful, forced motion controls, these are the best Nintendo has done, but I still want the option to play the game normally.

When it comes to Star Fox Guard, it has no motion controls whatsoever which is baffling considering the point of Star Fox Zero seems to be to sell gyroscope controls. The limited visibility in Star Fox Guard is a primary game mechanic too since it's a tower-defense game wherein you switch between multiple cameras. There are multiple levels, each with different layouts, and tons of missions to accomplish in Star Fox Guard but the mission is always the same: Stop robots before they get to the center of your base. Beating these missions is pretty satisfying of course and I like the camera-swapping gimmick used here. I don't play tower defense games often but this is definitely one that I'm having fun with. I would NOT buy Star Fox Zero to play Star Fox Guard considering it's available on the Wii U eShop.

Overall, it's hard to recommend Star Fox Zero. It can be really satisfying but it can also be really frustrating and it all depends on how comfortable you are with stiff movement and motion controls. I'm playing this game out of spite but there are a lot of people who are enjoying this game. ""It Gets Better Later"" is not a compliment but it applies to this game in a way.",Star Fox Zero utilizes gyroscope controls which aren't as bad as other games with forced motion-controls but the issue ...

I happened to drop it the day that I bought it and I haven't picked it up since.","Nothing but a boring, unbalanced grind."
B0050SYX8W,2.0,"Oh boy, where to begin with this game. (Spoilers, Duh)
First of all, I have to say I didn't buy it, I got it off a friends account. I had low expectations for it already because of what I had heard from a friend, but decided to try to go into it with an open mind.

First Level: Stumbling out of a sleep pod and being greeted by a new and improved animated Cortana while lens flares blinded me actually got me pumped. Dry ice effects swirled on the floor, tons of bright lights and beeping alarms as I ran through trying to discover why the ship was shaking and being scanned. It reminded me of a level from a much better game (Republic Commando). Then..*sigh*. I met the Covenant.
Oh boy. I swear my eyes twitched when I first saw them. My beloved Elites, my favorite alien race in gaming, ruined by a new design that was just..ugly. The Grunts looked like plastic turtles and sounded weird, with strange voice-changers instead of the beloved silly voice-acting we've come to know and love. The Jackals look like Krogan rip-offs from Mass Effect, pretty much every elite class has been changed and ruined. The only alien that really looks the same is the Hunter, and you don't meet them 'till way later in the game anyway.

After escaping the ship while enduring many poorly written attempts at humor by Cortana, you reach the planets surface (a generic jungle), and meet up with the new enemies. They look like an alien that crawled out of a Tron wannabe, and the environments you fight them in are ripped straight out of Tron. Glowing yellow and white guns that make techno noises, floating things everywhere, plastic floors and walls with glowing neon lights all over the place. I didn't feel like I was in a Halo anymore, I felt like I was in Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (and that was supposed to be a joke on sci-fi shooters). After many more long, un-enjoyable fights, meeting up with generic 2D characters that you're obviously supposed to like but are so annoying and flat you can't wait for them to leave the cutscene, you encounter ""The Librarian"".

Where to even start with this Voldermort mothers rip-off. First off, she floats around like an angel, she has an echo to her voice, and it's obvious she's the, ""I'm the angel here to explain all the plot points you don't understand"". After a good 5 minute cutscene of her spouting non-sense about you being the pinnacle of evolution and how ""only you can save the galaxy!!!"" she buggers off and you're thrown right back into the Tron world to fight hundreds more repetitive enemies.

Before I get to the end of the game, I have to talk about the main villain. The Didact. First off, he looks like a Pale Orc wanna' be from the Hobbit movies, and he talks in a fancy tongue, (the writers obviously wanted you to believe he was very intelligent, but his lines are so horribly written and bad guy generic that you can't wait for him to shut up). He goes the whole game talking in your ear about how foolish and weak you are, spouting large words like he's consulting a thesaurus before he talks.

At the end of the game, you kill him in the least epic way possible (a grenade to the face that doesn't even kill him and he falls into a black hole). The ending cutscene after you nuke yourself to save earth is actually one of the best cutscenes in the game. Cortana has now turned into Hardlight, and touches you for the first time, and very well written dialogue between her and Master Chief actually made me feel emotional. I don't know who the writer was for the whole game but it's like they kicked them out for this ending scene.
The ending of the game was actually likeable for me, it was a nice closer to Master Chiefs story for the first 3 games, getting him back on Earth ready to fight another day (and another sequel).

Now, before I say what I liked about the game, I want to address one of my main issues with it. Everything. Looks. Like. Plastic. That's right, all the enemies, allies, guns, vehicles, and most of the indoor environments all look like they were dipped in large vats of plastic then thrown into the game. I don't know what made them take this design choice, but it really ruined the aesthetic of the game. The visuals of Halo have always been very impressive and enjoyable for me, Bungie took great care in paying attention to detail, and I feel like 343 completely disregarded that and turned a lovable visual look into a generic plastic First Person Shooter (well, they kind of did that to the whole game). One thing to note is they also removed the Theater mode from singleplayer and Spartan Ops for no reason, giving a big middle finger to those who wanted to create Halo 4 story Machinimas (they even banned someone who was able to create a theater mode for singleplayer. Well done, 343).

Okay, what did I actually like about this game? They brought back the Covenant Carbine (one of my favorite weapons from the series) and the Battlerifle, and some of the singleplayer missions were actually enjoyable (the ones that were reminded me of older Halos, that's probably the only reason I liked them). Spartan Ops was a good edition (though it removed my beloved Firefight), I'd say it's better than the campaign in some ways, since you get to play as your own (silent) Spartan, so it feels more like Reach, and that you're forging your own story.

The fact that this is 343's first game can't excuse them for everything, BUT I am excited for Halo 5, and I'm giving them a second chance and am looking forward to the next installment of this franchise. I feel that if 343 does it right, and sticks to the original feel, this game series won't die for another several games.",A Let Down to an Iconic Gaming Series (But There is Still Hope)

Like Grid 2, there really isn't anything fun here.  Whenever you start a race, your car seems to be purposely handicapped as the rest of the field roars ahead as your car lags behind.  And God help you in the corners - the brakes are barely effective at all and the tires have so little grip that often you almost have to come to a complete stop before the car starts to change direction.  Unlike Grid 2, you do have the option of a driving line, but it is often barely visible or not really visible at all.  And (unlike Grid 2), it does (technically) have driver aids, but they seem to be largely ineffective.  I'm driving with the difficulty setting set to ""Very Easy"", and it's still a struggle.  And I excel in both Forza and Gran Turismo as well as most other racing games.  If you're a hard-core racing purist, this might appeal to you, but I don't think this will appeal to the majority of those that just want to have some fun. It's just too much work without much of any payoff. You can customize the paint/livery/rims, and that's really it. No functional upgrades to improve the cars that I can see.

Getting this thing to charch properly in the base is infuriating.  It never makes proper contact, and if it does, it doesn't maintain contact for long and shifts ever so slightly that it stops charging.  Just buy a USB cable and charge it through the charger port on the side.

Microphone is pretty poor quality.  I have significantly cheaper headsets that the microphone audio quality is substantially superior.  If they would have just abandoned the money they threw away on terrible R&D for the charge base, they could have invested in a microphone that didn't sound awful.

The signal only works on a very narrow channel and band that can't be modified, causing literally any wireless router or access point released in the last 15 years to interfere with it.  If you live in an apartment, college dorm, anywhere you can see multiple wifi networks, don't even bother buying these.

Signal strength is atrocious.  You can't go through a single room without it starting to crackle and break up, then the connection just dies (we're talking 15 feet, through one wall with no plumbing or major electrical).","Even if it were half the price, there are better headsets out there."

B005WWZUQ0,2.0,"My initial review was 5 stars. Since launch till now (Feb 2012) the game has been patched into a state of nearly ruin and I'm losing hope that BF3 can recover from this disaster.

The norm: 20 minutes wait to get into a server with multiple attempts taking several minutes each until you succeed.
The norm: NO GUNS bugs in game, requiring you to shut down BF3 and restart everything. Expect it to happen multiple times in a row.
The norm: Continual EA disconnect messages.
The norm: Continual Server timeouts.
The norm: Black screens requiring you to task manage out.
The norm: That when you get in a server to see kids using a wide variety of hacks gaining 200+ kills per round at the expense of your own kill/death ratio.
The norm: Grenade and missile spam.
The norm: Despite forming teams before joining a server, your squad will be continually split into opposite teams on every map change.

While a technical achievement, this game has the worst multiplayer handling I've ever seen. Nearly six months after launch and I'm convinced that EA and DICE have either given up on BF3 or just don't care. The Developers have created a great game that should have been game of the year across the board, but it appears EA and DICE MANAGEMENT have made decisions that have resulted in an unstable mess.

No one cares about Battlelog. No one wanted web browser game launchers. Origin is implemented like an outdated dinosaur. No one even understands what you were trying to accomplish by reinventing something that wasn't broken.

What players want is for DICE to patch this mess. I'd be extremely happy if DICE got rid of Origin and BattleLog completely. The modding community should spend less time building cheat hacks and become heroes by figuring out how to completely disconnect EA from BF3. The ranked server and unlock idea makes the game barely usable.

I would not buy Battlefield 4 if it used these same ""innovations"", and I'm definitely not buying any BF3 expansion packs.",How reinventing the wheel ruined this game
B00009WAV4,2.0,"I wanted to enjoy this game since the X series died
I got as far as the twin beetle bosses and no more.

The zero series changes everything you know of the X series and spikes up the difficulty for hardcore players.

X & Zero are no longer the same characters
I don't care for the new designs

Cons:
Unlike X, zero needs to be a, A or S rank to get the boss weapons. The bosses also get tougher with a new move... *sigh* something they or the player doesnt need. Thats really stupid capcom
Worse, the game rates your performance
Making it even harder
The very least you get are element chips.
Fire, ice & lightning which are pretty useless
Unless you have the boss weapons.
Thanks crapcom, you made a game not for everyone.
What good is a stupid chip if you cant get the boss weapon?
Stupid capcom. You're stupid

Levels that i had the most trouble
The jungle stage. The platforming/jumping & the hookshot of this game is no fun & the boss is cheap.

The arctic. Ice + spikes = frozen hell
I hate this stage
The boss is not fun either

The lava plant.
You must destroy four generators
Simple but gets slightly more tough
The boss
Most over powered jerk ever & cheap
The floors burst with flame.

The train.
Possibly the only fun stage
Untill midway where you must fight off drones stealing boxes.
The boss
Somewhat cheap but doable

Pros:
The forms are nice i guse",TOO HARD

B00BGA9Y3W,2.0,"Well, I've tried to give this game a fair shot in spite of the negative criticisms it's had. I came into this experience not expecting much, but honestly, after playing the game, I have to say that it was worse than I thought. I mean, it's not BAD, per se. It has lots of elements that you see in good games. Excellent graphics, interesting designs, varied locations, lots of things to loot, and smooth gameplay. The problem is that it all never quite comes together into a compelling experience, and for that, I absolutely blame the publisher, Activision. What the hell did they do to Bungie to downgrade them from a first class developer to a soulless cash cow? But I digress.

The story for this game is quite fascinating and deep, or at least I'm sure it is. I can't confirm that for myself, however, because I don't know what the story is. I just see tantalizing bits of it in the periphery of my vision, occasionally given to me by my robotic ""Ghost"" assistant, then it's gone. But since I'm given no reference point for why it was so significant in the first place, I have no reason to care. The game literally just pitches you face first into the middle of an epic space fantasy universe and immediately expects you to ""get it"". However, even at the beginning of the game, questions abound, and never relent. Who was I? Why did I die? Why did it take so long to bring me back to life? Am I an amnesiac? Who am I fighting? Why am I fighting them? What is the ""darkness"" and the ""light""? Are the evil factions also at war with each other? If so, why? Aren't they part of the ""darkness"" thing we're supposed to be worried about? What is the Traveler, and how is he preventing that city from being destroyed? And what the heck is up with that blue chick and her weird brother? Wait, what was I doing? Oh, God, am I an amnesiac for *real* now?!

The worst part is that you'll go into a mission with a vague idea of what you're supposed to be doing, told that it's very important for some convoluted reasons, then you'll immediately forget what your objective was and why it was important. I mean, for all I know, I'm actually the bad guy and I'm in the service of some evil deity, and we're killing aliens not for freedom but for mad loot. And then you kill an evil space blob, who is Satan, and suddenly you saved the day... apparently? I mean, we did? How? What? Huh? What's this about light ranks? Why am I doing these missions over and over again? Please buy the expansion?

Then there is the gameplay, which is, well, it's good. I mean, it's Bungie (supposedly), so the guns feel good to shoot. But still, a few things feel off. For instance, the automatic weapons are all practically worthless. They spray bullets carelessly everywhere to little effect. Okay, maybe that's just a matter of balance, but they overdid it. What matters far more in this game is not getting bullets on target, but getting *headshots*, as they are much more devastating, but they are also very difficult to achieve with a fully automatic weapon. There's also some odd choices made with the other gun types. Like, why are there three or four shot revolvers? Five is the minimum! Okay, three or four shot guns do exist (usually not as revolvers), but who would bring them into a battlefield? The stats are also hard to understand. Like, there's a category for stopping power, if I recall correctly. Okay, what does that do? And how does that relate to the damage my gun does? Finally, battles are a letdown. Every fight in Halo felt like a special event, with enemies and environments carefully chosen for the experience. Sometimes it feels that way here, but it's just as often that you'll bump into some aliens, shrug, and blast them with little effort.

Then there's magic. Yes, you have magic powers. The thing is, they all work on fairly lengthy cooldowns, so most of the killing work is done with guns. These powers are also somewhat analogous to each other, so even though they technically work differently between the classes, it doesn't seem to be sufficient to make them FEEL different. Playing as a Warlock, I can say that at no point did I feel like a space wizard. No, I was just another guy with a gun who happened to be able to throw weird grenades.

As for the missions, as mentioned before, some grand reason is always given for doing them, but it always feels like you're just a space hitman off to shoot his latest victim, with all other details being superfluous. They play out the same, too: Drop in, drive to the objective, kill guys along the way, wait for the Ghost to do something, kill more guys, then fight a boss. It's easy to see why the details fade away when you've felt like you've done it all before. You can try multiplayer, but I didn't care for it. Technically rank doesn't matter because everything is evened out, but in reality, some players will have more abilities than lower ranked players, and the fights simply lacked that smooth ebb and flow that Halo had in its multiplayer.

It's all just a damn shame because all the elements of a great game are *right there*. Something had to happen partway through development--I've heard of firings and script changes--that completely torpedoed everything, and ultimately brought us this. It would be easy to compare this to games like Borderlands, but Borderlands' plot made total sense and was a blast to play by comparison. Again, I'm forced to lay the blame for this on Activision, who, I presume, let itself get carried away with greed and just wanted Bungie as some other recognizable name to callously mine for profit, but never had any intention of allowing a true Bungie experience.","Bungie, are you feeling okay?"
B00178630A,2.0,"Buy Titan Quest and install the Diablo II Immortal MOD, below is how to accomplish this.
Hear ye, hear ye, this is Diablo II with a graphics update or Diablo III as it should have been...maybe. The point is, if you loved Diablo II and you just want better graphics, then just play this game with the Diablo II character classes. Let me tell to what to do and don't worry it is completely legal so don't worry. Unlike Blizzard's games where any modification will land you in the pen this game encourages modding and has some great ones. The one you'll care the most about though, like me, is called Diablo 2 Immortal. Go to titanquest(dot)net a very friendly very legal website and look under their modding tab and find the D2 Immortal mod and download it. It should be fairly simple to install, but should you run into any issues leave me a note and I'll gladly help you out. Believe me, I want people to find this and enjoy it like I have. I had been dying to play my Skeleton raising Necromancer and my Hammerdin from Dibalo 2 but I lost my D2 expansion disk and didn't want to drop $20 again on D2 and plus I'm furious at Blizzard for the abomination that they released and insultingly called it Diablo III.

B00BGA9ZZ4,2.0,"I've seen a few games in my life. Been collecting since SNES. I've played good racing games and bad racing games. People said a lot of bad things about this one. Is DRIVECLUB that bad? I'm so glad you asked.

I'll start on a good note. This game is beautiful. The cars look almost real. The locations look stunning and the weather effects also deliver. This is it. I can't say anything good about the gameplay or numerous features, that this game promised to deliver.

It's so f-ing boring, damn it! The locations are lifeless. The music is so generic, it belongs in Need for Speed 2. The whole game feels like an old racer, way before Midnight Club.

There are a lot of network features, that make a difference, but don't really add much depth. Sometimes the servers are down for no reason whatsoever. Multiplayer rarely works good, although I haven't had any connection problems with NFS Rivals or The Crew.

I dropped this game after beating a few tours. Why? It's simple. Whatever car you drive, it feels similar to the other one. If you drive a hatchback, it goes fast. If you drive a GT, it feels the same as a hatchback, but a little bit faster. A hyper car is simply uncontrollable. I've had a few cars from the list so I know, how they should feel.

The gameplay is repetitive and boring. NFS Rivals is a better game, although it had so much things done wrong.",Don't be deceived
B001SQ0ZV4,2.0,"I liked the looks of this controller over the traditional Wii-mote so I figured I'd give it a shot.

After fumbling around with the sync buttons, I finally managed to get it to communicate with the Wii.  I open up a game and it disconnects and won't reconnect.  I grab my other remote and sure enough, it works fine but the Niko won't resync.  After resetting the Wii I managed to get it to work on the menu again only to have it drop the sync once I started a game...

B001IK1BJ0,2.0,"I can't believe this game gets as much credit as it does.  It is inferior to Mass Effect in every way (both titles).  Graphics, Controls, Story writing, Character writing, Voice over acting, you name it.  These graphics are literally worse than Mass Effect 1!  Inexcusable, Bioware.  To be fair, the Voice acting is very good for many roles.  However, many side characters have terrible voice acting, and the main bad guy (the one that's actually a CHARACTER, rather than a non-speaking monster), Loghain, has terrible voice acting.  This can make or break a story, see Saren (and then Sovereign) in Mass Effect for a successful villain example.  The story is the same old-same old and they don't do enough with specifics to make the story believable and cool.  (To see how to do this, unfold the story in Mass Effect 1 during play, this story is also very derivative, but the specifics turn it into something new and awesome!)  RPG's need to have good story to work.  But the biggest crimes are the console controls!  I doubt the PC controls are much better.  Better, yes, but I bet 100% it feels just like Baldur's Gate.  That is the ultimate problem with this game.  It plays like a 10+ year old, game, only limited by a console controller.  Just what I always wanted!  However, if you were itching for Baldur's Gate ported to Xbox/PS3 and don't care that the controls are slow and frustrating, then you might like this game.  Ultimately, I suspect the issue comes down to the fact that for Mass Effect they were able to build two sets of controls, one for powers (basically borrowing the weapon wheel from Ratchet and Clank, which was perfect), and the other set was basic shooter controls, an action game.  That's the problem is that this game has almost no action element.  They needed to import a modified fighting game set of controls to make being a fighter or rogue feel cool, instead of lame.  You literally have to baby sit every action your rogues (to position for backstabbin) and wizards take.  People who don't like critics of this game claim that we are idiots and you can do everything with proper Tactics (AI routines that you pick for each character, which control them when you are controlling one of the other characters.)  Good Tactics and good use of the hot buttons do make it easier, but it's still a pain in the butt, it's slow, and requires too much micro-managing.  The power wheel would have been better if it were streamlined and focused on your activated powers, instead of forcing you to push 2 buttons to go 2 levels deep to get to your powers.  They also put inventory and crafting in this power wheel, not the best idea.  Someone else on Amazon compared the controls to an MMO or Dungeon Siege, which is definitely accurate (though I've never technically played an MMO).  Equipment management is also awful, though to be fair, that makes Dragon Age on par with every other game like it (only ME2 is on the right track, but that might not work for this style of game).  Something needs to be done to reduce time spent in the inventory screens.  Again, if you want a game that is only the slightest evolution beyond Baldur's Gate (namely the 3d person over the shoulder camera, and you can use a console controller in front of your TV), then this is the game for you.  A specific level complaint: The Orzammar mission and the Broken Mage's Circle mission are way too long and feel like the worst kind of grind (Origin stories, Brecilian forest, and Ostagar are better).  One last character complaint.  Allistair - people talk about him like he's the best character.  BS!  His voice acting is awesome, but the dialogue they wrote for him is ridiculous!  Some of his dialogue is great, but about 30-40% is WAY too silly!  I mean like C3PO silly.  Really a bad idea for a character that's a warrior, a Grey Warden, and a templar.  I just don't buy it.  Lastly, RPG's are supposed to have replay value.  I couldn't stop myself from re-playing ME and ME2.  To actually replay this game after finishing it feels like work!  Ugh.  I will end by saying that you can also increase your enjoyment by playing a wizard (with proper hot button selections), and/or dialing down the difficulty to Easy (hate to say it but it's true..)  Until I see something overwhelmingly awesome in store for Dragon Age 2, I am done with paying for anything with this name on it.  Try again, Bioware.",bad controls and not as good as Mass Effect

B002I0J6DC,2.0,"I enjoyed this game at first, but it didn't take too long

to put the shortcomings under my thumb.  The environments are really good,

and the cutscenes (not even my thing) are amazing!  The whipping combat

may entertain you for a while, but it doesn't balance out the bad platforming sections.

It took me a while to even understand what buttons and directions to enable

in order to get my sorry kiester across the many cliffs you'll run into.  I can't tell

you how many times I wanted to jump somewhere, and all I did was plummet.  The combat

can be complex, as you have light and dark energy to use and charge.  The upgrade system is straightforward,

but some moves require the goofiest button combo's ever.  The gameplay's relatively smooth in regards

to framerate, but becomes rigid as far as the character's movement is concerned.  You may have heard

that you're bound to run into confusion while searching for how to progress.  The stationary cam is the prime suspect

in regards to this matter.  You should've seen the quizical look on my face when I accidently found my way

to the next area, while the camera didn't even show how I got there.  You don't want to see my face, as I get stuck again.

Where to go?  Where to go?  I've had enough.  When you get weapon upgrades, you can replay previous levels

to find new stuff.  This is one of those games in which the varying aspects of gameplay are contradictory.

The simple nature of combat and platforming contrast with the complexity of finding keys, useless combo's and

broken cliff diving.  Don't get me wrong, I got some kicks in, but grew tired only 25% of the way through.

The boss fights can either be complicated (due to platforming, timing and trial and error) or grueling (widdling

down combat).  **software  Complete at your own peril.","Had promise, but too 2-D oriented.  Whip it!"

B000R0SS3Y,2.0,"I just finished Too Human and I can only recommend it to Players who are dying for a hack n' slash for the 360.  This game has some great innovation and some horrendous flaws.

Story:
The story is a mix between the Matrix and Norse Mythology.  As the story began I felt like I was reading the 8th novel in a series because all sorts of epic things were happening and I had no clue what was going on.  Apparently, the Norse gods live in the matrix, fight monsters with swords and laser guns, and travel through cyber space.  My friends told me the story was awful and I really tried to like it, but I just couldn't.  The main character, Baldur is voiced by Crispin Freeman of Hellsing.  I'm a big fan of Hellsing... still couldn't get into the story.

Gameplay:
The gameplay basically sucks.  You use the triggers to fire your long range weapons and the right analog stick to point to the enemy that you want to attack with a melee weapon.  (sword, hammer...)  If you double tap the stick, you launch the enemy into the air and you can jump combo them or shoot them as they fall.  This is pretty fun.  However, often times, you target enemies that you don't want to target.  To make matters worse, some enemies explode or poison you.  So, you end up dying from time to time by accident.  What really breaks the game is that unless you play the Bio-Ops class, you cannot heal yourself.  That's right.  No health potions, regeneration, heal spells... nothing.  The only way to get health is from random enemy drops.  Sometimes, you can kill 30 guys and they don't drop anything.  Other times, you can kill 3 and 2 of them drop health.  This is extremely frustrating because you may be near death, and there's nothing that you can do.  There are crystals that you can destroy in the environment, that drop health, money, or weapons, but those are random as well.  With no consistent way to regain health, you end up dying repeatedly.  This is NO FUN!

Death:
Dying takes about 30 seconds to a minute.  An angel comes down and takes your body away.  There are times in this game where I saw the angel more than I was playing.  This was very frustrating.

Economy:
The economy of the game is pretty good.  You never have too much money and you need to make decisions on what weapons you want.

Inventory:
This game may feature the best RPG inventory system of all time.  It's incredibly easy to sell, buy, and customize your weapons and armor.  You don't have to waste hours in cities like most other RPG's.  It's all done with the Start Button and a few inventory screens.

Art:
The art style of the game is very cool.  A nice blend of Warhammer 40k and Norse Mythology.

Camera:
The camera is your friend most of the time.  However, sometimes... the camera is not your friend.  When you are in combat, it is difficult to target enemies and you often target the wrong enemy.  The camera points to that enemy allowing you to get killed from behind.  This is... no fun.

RPG:
You get new gear and level up quite often and that gives you a good sense of accomplishment.  However, the enemies level up with you, so most of the encounters feel exactly the same.

Overall:
Playing through the game once takes about 12-13 hours.  About 3 of those hours are fun.  2 of those hours are nonsensical cutscenes.  2 of those hours are spent leveling up and getting new gear.  The other 5 or 6 hours are painful.

So, if you're a big fan of hack and slash games, don't mind a weird story, want to play Diablo without health potions, and know a bit about Norse mythology... pick it up.

Anyone else... you've been warned.  You're in for a confusing and frustrating time.",Madness meets Genius

B00139RPNW,2.0,"The first Chronicles of Narnia game (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) was an amazing game.  Stellar graphics, seemless transition from movie to game, imaginative level design, excellent two player strategy, a level system for special attacks, etc.  Therefore, I was excited to play Prince Caspian.

I think there are a few things that ruin this game.  First is it not being linear.  Each level is open-ended.  Each stage is broken down into different areas that are re-accessible over and over again.  Items re-appear and you are asked with a prompt if you'd like to re-do the area.  I don't know who thought that would be a good idea.

Second, most of the game is just finding the missing lever so that you can re-attach it to the crank.  There is an over-abundance of crank pulling, which takes 5 seconds or more of button mashing to complete.

Third, there are no special attacks. In the first game you were allowed to level up and earn special attacks.  Characters now are limited to three attacks or less, with very little variation. Lucy cannot even use her cordial to heal, Susan does not use the pan flute or the horn, etc.

Fourth, there are 20 or more playable characters in this game.  You cannot choose the character you want at any given time, but are limited to whatever characters they give you in each stage. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather play as the main characters and not as a tree, centaur, or Caspian's tutor.

Fifth, Huge Battles play out in the background.  They are just eye candy.  You can stand in the middle of a huge battleground and never be hurt.  The game is easy.  Involving button mashing to get through.

Sixth, missions are boring.  More crank turning and many  things in the game were not in the movie at all.

Seventh - The first game featured cast interviews and other interesting extras and movies.  This game lacks in that department.

The problem with this game was that there wasn't much to the movie or the book, so they didn't have much to work with in the first place; however, it could have still been a great game, if it played like the first.

I'm a big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia, but this game is nothing more than button mashing, crank turning, and major character hopping with characters I had no desire to be.  I recommend the first Narnia game over this one any day.

The Good:
Graphics
Sound

The Bad:
Gameplay - button mashing, crank turning, and lever pulling game
Lack of special attacks
Unremarkable playable characters and gameplay
Non-linear stage design gives game a choppy feel to it
Lack of interesting extras/unlockables",How disappointing.

B001B1W3GG,2.0,"So I just finished playing Bioshock. What a waste of time. This game was truly a disappointment. I don't understand why it gets such rave reviews. First of all, it has no business being called a first person shooter. Sure, there are elements of an FPS, such as the gameplay being in first person and you get to shoot things, but that's where it ends. It plays more like an RPG than an FPS. Go here, there, find this, that, shoot a couple things, solve a bunch of puzzles. It is so boring. If you like first person shooters, you most likely will not like this game. If you are over the age of 15, you will probably not like this game. The graphics are childish and cartoon-y. Any attempt the game tries to make at being a thriller is futile because of this. It's like watching an animated film. If you have the patience to follow the story, you might find it intriguing, though I certainly didn't. I think the creators of this game should have just made an animated film instead of wasting serious gamers' time. After a few levels, the game becomes a tad repetitive and there's really no reason to keep playing, unless you're going after the trophies like I was. Overall, I gave this game two stars because I didn't like it--I did not enjoy playing it, but I didn't absolutely hate it. It did not capture my attention, but it also did not frustrate me because it was so easy. I mostly just found it slow-paced and boring. It seems more like a game for young teens, not for ""mature"" adults. I'm sure kids will get a kick out of the cursing, blood, and sexual themes.

B00SVVUOGU,2.0,"I make a console purchase due to the racing game it has attached to it.  PS has the GT series, while Xbox has Forza.  Well, I finally bit and bought an Xbox One brand new (I rarely buy consoles new) for Forza 6 and boy did I just toss 500 dollars down the drain.  This game has a neutered career mode that includes NO event list and NO customization, well technically it does but since the game FORCES to upgrade your cars for you first, it takes all the want out of doing it yourself.  And the new MODS feature, really, just really?  Racing sim turned full arcade racer with the new MOD feature, I can't even explain how horrible dumb of an idea this is.  I also like to WIN my races for pete's sake, with the old Forza 3/4 event list, I can go back and re-race my 2nd and 3rd place wins to shoot for the 1st place, not here, the game just forces you to the next race and gives you a blue ribbon for participation (and you also get the SAME credit for losing as you do winning).  I feel like a middle schooler playing this game.  Why does this game even exist?  I get the same rewards if I lose as if I win, that's completely opposite of the meaning of the word game.  I have nothing to work for, I have nothing to strive for, I have no reason to try to do good in this game.

Redeeming features are obviously the physics, graphics, tracks and cars.  And oh my lord the cars, these beautiful beautiful cars, I actually found my old 1991 Mitsu Galant VR-4 in the list, I haven't seen this car in a game since one of the earliest Gran Turismos.  And I have tried to make a personal goal to complete the game instead of the lousy in game incentives so I make myself want to keep playing, yes, the game is fun and there are plenty of hours of gameplay to be had here.

So, basically, I ended up spending 580 dollars for this game, I am not a gamer so I will never buy another game for this system unless they release a redeeming Forza for it.  It gets two stars because the attached console streams other content quite well, and the game itself is fun unless the game is forcing you into races you don't like.","Here's your spoon fed, blue ribbon for participation racing sim."
B00BHSTXV6,2.0,"I don't know who thought it was a good idea to use glossy black surfaces around the keys on a keyboard. It's not. Fingerprint smear magnet, the keyboard always looks dirty. Additionally, the finish is so cheap that even wiping it with a microfiber cloth scratches the glass black surface!!

So you have a smudgy surface material, so cheaply applied that you cant even wipe it off without scratches. DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUUUUMB.

 The backspace key squeaks, which drives me nuts. The rest are okay, the key press travel is good, the sound is pretty quiet. Ive seen others complain about the key spacing being bad for typing quickly, but I have not found that to be an issue.

The keyboard is cheap and hollow feeling though, and unnecessarily big. Its not any better than any other keyboard, in fact I would say it was worse that the OEM one.

B000X25GW2,2.0,"OMG, everyone and their grandmother have fallen all over this game because it's SOOOO GOOOD cause ITS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER WII GAMES....no.  Just because something's different doesn't mean it's good, and in this case, it's just plain bad.  Just how bad, well...

1.  The City

Empty.  Lifeless.  Unnecessary.  It's so big, and getting places takes so long that it seems like it was done to aribitrarily extend the length of the game.  It would have been better to just have a map screen and a cursor option to click where to go.  The only ""things"" you have to find are Lolikov Balls (which help give you new moves you don't need and won't use), and dumpsters filled with T-shirts you won't wear, and money on occasion, that's so low in value that it's hardly worth the effort.  The bike doesn't even do cool jumps - it's a freakin motorcycle!

2.  Fighting Mechanics

Works good at first, but then try a ""free fight"" mission where you can't get hit.  Now have 3 of them surround you, and try to use an attack that hits multiple enemies.  You can't can you?  That's cause there isn't one!  Your charge attack, when it works, doesn't kill them all instantly - just knocks them down - and leaves your weapon without a charge, which means you have to run away to recharge it!

Wrestling moves are ok, but only useful in boss fights.  Regular henchmen are better dispatched with the sword.  The enemies get tougher as time moves on, which is made worse by a camera that conveniently forgets to show you there's enemies behind you.

3.  Story

The story is the only thing the game has going for it, if that.  You're supposed to want to be the #1 assassin, and you've got some hot Russian? chick annoying you along the way.  (I haven't finished the game, but I hope to god the main character kills her, it would make me SO happy).  You fight bosses who are all more interesting than either of the main characters.  Why do I care about Travis again?  He's not funny, he's not hurt or damaged, he's just a pompous jerk.

4.  Logical Gaps.

In one of the boss fights, you're tricked, fall into a sand pit, and get BLOWN UP BY GRENADES.  How does Travis survive?  The previous fight as you tricked and shot across the room via laser beam.  Again - you don't die instantly?  I thought you had a light saber, not super powers.  Oh, and speaking of logic gaps, the PAL game is censored for blood, so all we get is black particles and coins, however the same grenade boss STICKS A GRENADE IN HER MOUTH AND BLOWS HER HEAD OFF.  You're telling me that's better than blood all over the place?  (Her head is comically shown like looney toon charcoal, but we all know what happened).

5.  The gameplay

Chores.  You have to do chores.  It sounds like someone's having a little satirical fun - and it's fine at first.  Cocnuts, lawn mowing, trash pick up - first few times, OK we get the joke.  By the 8th time it's not funny.  Same goes for the over the top video rental girl who tells you which sexual movie you have overdue at the store.  Funny once.  A chuckle the second time.  By the 8th time you're just pressing skip.  The ""assassination missions"" (not to be confused with the actual missions) are well, boring.  You're only doing them to make money to get into the next fight - again game stretching.  If I didn't have to do that the game would have only been 5 hours.  The game is supposed to be a game - NOT A CHORE.  The game ALMOST got interesting after boss 5, but I'm still waiting to see something resembling vision by boss 2.  I haven't.

The graphics are horrendous for a PS2 game, unlike the PC version, these graphics seem muddy and unclear.

B00CJXYU9S,2.0,"The visuals and character designs are cool.

The gameplay is routine but decent.

The story is nothing short of a cliche-ridden travesty with a terrible ending.

It's as if the creator just Googled words like ""psychology"", ""dementia"" and ""insanity"" and just formed a story from the first wiki article he read. No actual research was done and the game comes off as incredibly amateurish and actually somewhat embarrassing. Unless you pay more for DLC, character arcs are left unresolved and the entire experience comes off as unfinished.

Another issue are the recycled boss fights. The initial encounters with the main three villains are intensely fun, but you literally have to do each about three times each. This not only ruins a sense of completion and victory, but also hinders the already insipid plot further by showing you kill these enemies--then having them inexplicably come back to life. It ruins tension and excitement when for the nth time, the same boss appears repeating the same mechanic again and again and AGAIN.

It's a lazy weekend game, but disappointing beyond that. I was hoping the story might be even B-movie good, but it was infinitely worse.",Horrible Story; Decent Fun.
B004NBZBME,2.0,"(I own this game on Steam, hence the lack of ""verified purchaser"" title).

Although I've had this game for a while, I decided recently to take on the (not so) daunting task of playing through it so I can shuffle it to my ""Completed"" category.

PLOT: I load the game up. A mesh of real-life news excerpts and fictional yet credible pieces flashes before my eye, setting up this grim future in which the world's oil supplies have nearly been depleted, a gallon of gas costs $20 (USD), and North Korea somehow had the ability to take over half the world, America included. The level loads. I'm apparently a pilot, and I'm being taken somewhere by the North Korean occupiers (affectionately referred to as ""Norks"" in this game). Along the way, I'm rescued by a one dimensional group of freedom fighters, who whisk me away to the mountains from which we conduct daring nighttime guerilla raids on the labor camps and graffiti GO WOLVERINES! everywhere. Oops, wrong movI mean game.

Honestly, the plot isn't too bad (though even in the game's garbage heap of a world, it's still hard to imagine North Korea taking over a herd of cows, let alone the entire world). There's a decent amount of lore (61 pieces) spread throughout the levels that help you figure out how the world came to be this way. And at least during the first two or three levels there's some exposition to to the state of things. This falls completely flat later on, though.

They really could have done a lot better with the pacing of the story. Essentially every level, with the exception of the last, revolves around you doing one simple task that would take up perhaps one level in a different game. The last level itself just feels like a bonus, thrown in there so you get a few more opportunities for frustration. The characters are even worse: You've got the hesitant tech savvy nerd guy, the compassionate lady, the wise older compassionate cop guy, and the reckless guy that has no anger management skills. They don't evolve at all throughout the game. Enjoy their crappy, generic personalities for the whole ride.

And I don't want to spoil the ending, but let's just say: You beat the last level. You get a 15 second audio clip that basically explains what you just did. And then the credits roll. Deep. Oh, did I mention you're a pilot? Yeah, that is mentioned a few times, and you fly something in one level, but it's rather irrelevant. Also did I mention you have a mission? Because it's also irrelevant, because they never explain fully what you're doing or why you're doing it. It's like someone put the game together and wrote some of the dialogue but decided they'd cut each conversation off halfway and call it good.

GRAPHICS: The world looks alright. You've got papers flying around in the middle of combat, fires raging, etc... But when you actually look at the detail, you realize it's definitely lacking in some departments. Character models are fairly average. Blood splatter textures repeat (so if you hit a guy three times through the stomach, you'll see the same three blood splatters behind him). Fires were like something out of a corny 90's Russian action flick. And the gun models essentially look more or less the same, though obviously sniper rifles and SMG's are easy to tell apart.

SOUND: Not really a memorable soundtrack. When you shoot guns it sounds like you're shooting Air Rifles or BB Guns. Friendly AI will shout out the same order to you a million times while you try to figure out the best way to approach a given route through enemy territory, so that gets annoying after a while (I'd say ten seconds). There's one part where they start playing music, a la Apocalypse Now, but the effect is ruined because the song barely starts playing before... well, you'll see.

GAMEPLAY: I was typing this section up and then realized, it's the same game as Modern Warfare 2, except instead of Russians, it's the equally implausible North Koreans. If you haven't played MW2: It's a linear shooter where you kill people and advance through the levels to ""advance"" the ""plot"". That's about it. Sometimes the game tells you to press a key to make something happen, a key that to this point you haven't even felt, but that's about it. The friendly AI is frustrating and will get you killed; either it will block you from safely maneuvering to cover, leaving you exposed to enemy bullets; or it will block your hasty retreat from a grenade indicator.  Long story short, if you've played through the first combat encounter in the game, you've basically played the whole game. Oh, and I completed it on the hardest difficulty in 7 hours (that's with a lot of dying on each level, except for one).

TL;DR: If you like generic shooters and want to just kill people, and you like short games, this is the game for you. If not, try out something with a little more depth, such as the ArmA series, Deus Ex, or Shadow Warrior which is at least funny.",They may as well have called it Hall of Fruty

B00FE8WKMO,2.0,"I loved the wii-fit.  I thought wii-fit plus improved on that.  But although the wii-fit-U has potential, it has more negatives than positives.  If you already have the wii-fit plus, I would NOT recommend upgrading.

Positives:
- You can save 3of your own ""routines""
- There are some new mini-games
- The pedometer will sync to the game, and show a history of what you've done

Negatives
- Many of the old mini-games are GONE (""big top"" balance/juggle game, beach segway game, balance and catch fish, and others)
- When you go through any of your own routines that you created, it is much slower due to having to hit ""A"" through a lot of messages and pausing between each exercise.  It's annoying and it really increases the time to do a simple set of exercises.  Plus you have to keep a remote either in your hand or close by.
- I'm on my 2nd meter and the attempt to record altitude just doesn't work well at all.  I wish it did, it would motivate me to use the stairs more.
- There is a problem when you replace the battery on the meter.  I've found others report this same problem on the Nintendo forums, so it's not just mine.  I had problems with my first meter, it would occasionally say the battery had been replaced (it hadn't)  and when this happened the wii-fit would consider me a new user during the weigh-in.  Not a BIG deal, just annoying and time-consuming.  But then that became permanent (it goes together with a message from the animated board ""is it just me or have we gone back in time"").
All my data is there if I look at the graphs, but every time I do the daily weigh in I have to get all the extra messages for a new user!  And always do the intro-balance game ... never any others.  Everyday it wants me to set a weight goal (it won't remember the one from yesterday).  This is VERY annoying and time consuming to do every day.

I expect this problem will become more common as other people's batteries get changed.
Calling Nintendo was no help, they claim to have no record of the problem (though you can find questions on their forums back to 2011, and some very recent ones with it resurfacing due to the meter).
The only fix seems to be to create a new user - which is VERY annoying.  I lose all my data back to 2008, have to open up the advanced options of all exercises.  I can't ""just"" recreate my exercise routines because some exercises aren't available to me as a new user.
So before this major set back with making a new user, i'd have given it a 3 or a 4 star.  Worth it if you don't already own the wii-fit plus, or if you love tracking your walking within the game.  I regretted buying the wii-U just so i could upgrade this game, even before i had to create a new user.

I can't give it one-star because I still am a fan of wii-fit in general.  So if you don't own any version of the game ... you don't have the risk of losing years of data, so it's worth getting (if you already own the Wii-U and balance board).
I'm still holding out hope Nintendo fixes the problems - the game does have potential to be an improvement.","Initially Disapointing, then VERY frustrating"
B0055QZ216,2.0,"I hate this mouse. I hate it so hard. The tiny buttons above and below the wheel, which increase and decrease DPI are annoying because you'll find yourself accidentally pressing them while using the mousewheel. Furthermore, because of the defective software, every time you resume your computer from standby, or restart, the DPI setting will be **different** than you left it last, and you'll find the mouse is either way too sensitive, or not sensitive enough. If you try pressing the DPI up buttons on the mouse, nothing will happen until you open the actual software - **even if the software is running in the background**. This is so annoying; I literally smash my mouse against the desk. The buttons on the side of the mouse, used for back/forward are more of a nuissance than anything. I find myself constantly pressing them by accident and navigating away from my webpage. They cannot be disabled, even with the software.

I can also say the mouse is not comfortable in your hand with prolonged or even intermittent use. The left and right mouse buttons only work if you press them at the very top part of the mouse- this puts a lot of strain on your wrist and forewarm. I much prefer the cheapo lenovo mouses we have where I work. I also have frequent issues with this mouse on my USB ports.. it only seems to work on certain USB ports at certain times, even with the drivers and software installed. Sometimes when I turn on my computer, the mouse isn't even lighting up and I have to plug it into another port. All in all, this mouse is horrible. It's terrible for gaming because it's too big and too uncomfortable, and it's impossible to get the DPI setting just right.

B002TG40BI,2.0,"I had actually purchased this in 2010, but forgot whether or not it was good since I didn't write a review on it. So I played it again. This is not a game that I will play a again. The tombstone puzzles were ok for the first 2-3, but having to piece together ALL tombstones (and there is a lot of them) was just plain ridiculous. On top of that, you had to find four of the same image on each tombstone (such as a pickaxe or bottle). Those were very hard to see.

In order to go to a new building, you had to complete a tombstone. When you go to a building, you need to find 3 flies outside so you can get a hint. Then you have to open the door with the key that you get from each tombstone. Then complete the HOS in order to get the next bag of tombstone pieces. This is the same routine for every single house and every single tombstone. That is the entire game. You don't go walking around from area to area either.

The graphics were ""ok"", def not the best. The sound/music was good. The HO scenes were ridiculous. Many of the items you cannot even see because it is stuff in a dark part of the area or blends in too much with other objects. Example would be a black bowtie. In one of the HO scenes, that was finally found on an object that was also black. Had to use a hint for that. Some of the house had one extra room where you had to find differences in 2 photos. The photos are all black, white, and tan. Very hard to even see the differences. If you exit the scene before finishing HOS or matching, you had to start the whole scene over. You are only given 2 hints in the beginning, and then once they are used, you have to find 3 flies outside buildings to get 1 hint. If you use the hint in the HOS, it takes 2 long minutes to refill to get 1 hint. So basically you walk in the building with 1, and for the most part walk out with 0 and have to search for flies at the next building. Pretty screwed up way of getting hints and reloading hints.

No adventure or ""real"" puzzles in this game. Piecing together the tombstone which is much like a jigsaw puzzle is the only type you do in this game. I don't recommend this game. Boring.","Boring, not fun."

B01FSO3VGC,2.0,"First of all this product is fine, if you like monster collecting games you will probably like this one. However this game has some major pitfalls compared to other similar games on the market that you should be aware of before buying and its not all its cracked up to be:

I played this game for many hours already and I can say it doesn't really do much better than the first. There are still some huge, huge fundamental problems with this game:

This game is just like the first one no surprise there, its obviously a continuation of the first game but is set in the exact same world as the first game. The buildings have names on them this time which helps immensely with game play and navigation. There are a few new areas that you can explore by train, but if you played the first, once you get into it, this one looks just like it.

This game is basically a giant game of fetch quests, if you don't like fetch quests stay far away. This means you have to get this and that for a NPC (non-player character), if you don't do these quests you can't advance in the game. The other thing you do in this game is of course, battle and try to catch Yokai. There are Yokai bosses too, just like in every other video game. This game does do a slightly better job than the first one in guiding you to complete quests that are essential to the storyline. There is a pointer that you can enable so that you know where to go now during story specific fetch quests. The optional fetch quests however are much more difficult as you really don't know where to go for those, since the pointer does not follow you around. Some quests are absurdly difficult, the optional ones that is, like one quest requires you to catch a specific bug, however the bug is very very hard to find, I spent a couple hours alone looking for the one bug, and eventually gave up because I couldn't find it. A game that requires me to search for a bug that takes a couple hours to find is not fun for me.

Money: Money is horribly, horribly short in this game (in game funds, not real world funds). Each battle will only get you a few cents in the beginning at least. Maybe 10-50 cents per battle. You will need money to take the train, which you need to complete story quests and advance the story of the game. You need money to buy food and stuff to feed the Yokai, but its no secret that money was much more plentiful in the first game. You will often find yourself grinding for money if you run out and want to buy something. There are items all over that you can find and sell for money so that is what I did, and it does help, but the money gotten after battles is just very very small amounts.

The battle system is okay in this game, its actually not too bad, kind of innovative and fun. This is probably one of the best parts of the game. But it can get annoying at times because it doesn't feel as responsive as it should be, for example yokai will take a long time to charge up a soultimate move and while they are charging they could die from a hit from the opponent. The animations while charging the yokai take too long . I have lost a lot of yokai this way even though I am spinning and tapping as fast as I literately can during the minigame sequences. The game just lags in this department. If it was responding quickly to my movements on the screen this would not be a problem.

Bug catching is another problem, its basically completely random in this game. You also have to spin twice for most bugs. Fortunately bug catching is mostly optional, but when you are forced to do it, I am not sure if there are any points where you are forced to catch bugs to advance the story, but you will loathe it, believe me. Its 500 times more difficult than what it was in the first game.

Yokai are still very difficult to befriend, however it seems to be just a tiny bit easier to get Yokai in this game, it is still frustrating and takes a long time to befriend a Yokai.

Trading of Yokai can only occur between friends, that friend has to be on your friends list. This person would also have to be connected to the internet to trade online, as in you have to specifically tell your game to connect to the internet for trades by pushing a button on the screen in the game, since most people playing the game don't do this even if they have a 3DS system that is connected to the internet. It makes it very difficult to trade Yokai. Yokai can be locally traded between versions if you are physically near the person you want to trade with. There is no way to randomly trade Yokai with other players, you can't just go online and make a trade. This means you would have to somehow meet another person online and set up a trade for a specific time and hope it works out, if you don't have friends that play the game locally. If you are trading, it has to be pre-arranged either in person or with another person online.

Trading requires 2 3DS systems and 2 copies of the game, since there are 2 versions of this game, there are some Yokai you cannot get in each game, so you won't be able to get every Yokai unless you buy 2 copies of the game, 2 3DS systems or trade with another player who has the other version.

You still cannot trade Yokai from this cartridge to other versions of this game. You cannot trade your Yokai from Yokai Watch 2 to Yokai watch 3 when and if it comes out in the USA. You cannot import your Yokai from Yokai watch 1 either. Every Yokai you worked hard for will be stuck on this cartridge forever. Due to this fact alone, I feel this game is not worth playing. My time is valuable, and I don't wish to recruit the same monsters game after game when I already have them on the cartridge, especially when other similar games on the market have this system built into them. It just feels like a completely pointless game and a complete waste of my time to even play this game when there are other games on the market that do this. If this game just had this one feature, I would be very happy to play it and put the time into it.

I am not happy with Level 5's treatment of this game either, I follow a message board about this game and they sent messages to some of the members who put up passwords and QR codes for this game that give out coins that can be used in a machine in game called the ""crank a kai"" to get rare yokai and rare items,, and sent messages to a very popular youtuber who had videos about this game and made them make the videos private so no one else could see them. They clearly don't want any information about this game on the internet. I won't go any further with this but I am not happy about this and in the future I probably will not be buying any more Yokai games or any more of Level 5's games due to this. There is also no official guide for this game, that tells me they did not put very much effort into this release in the USA.

The bottom line, a lot of this game is based on random luck, and sometimes that can be very, very frustrating and very hindering to progress in the game. You can trade from Yokai watch 2 to other copies and versions of Yokai watch 2 but you cannot import Yokai from Yokai watch 1 or trade to Yokai watch 3 when it comes out. Expect to spend a ton of time in this game grinding for levels and money. You will have to fight the same Yokai many many times to befriend it and get it on your team, then once you do that you realize when the next game comes out you have to start all over again since Yokai cannot be traded between different versions.

If you are buying I recommend buying one version of Yokai watch whether you choose Yokai watch 1 or 2, and sticking with it, just don't expect to ever be able to trade your Yokai to another version in the future.","A game with too many bad points to ignore, just don't expect to ever be able to trade Yokai between versions"

...........................
+ Visuals are fine
+ Digimon follow you and there's lots of variety
...........................
- board requests feel grindy and empty

- you level too fast. Weird criticism right? But it's a problem. Your digimon level so fast and evolve so often you just don't care about any of them. You can barely keep track of moves as they come and go. Which really feeds into the next item...

- welcome to auto battle the game. You have so little reason to be playing it other than turning auto battles on for almost all the fights. Switch the difficulty to hard and let the game play itself. It'll choose the best moves against the best types as you would have anyway. The only situation it differs are some of the boss fights where you just stack status effects and win.

- all other functions are surprisingly limited and small. Digifarm is barely anything you touch once a few hours. Mirror dungeon lets you redo dungeons, but only some of them so it's more or less worthless.

- hope you like never having control of your camera, since you don't. Most you can do is sometimes zoom in or out, but when you walk a dungeon it feels jarring to not be able to look around.

- the story is so forgettable it hurts. Strong start but you stop caring so fast.

B000FO4KO8,2.0,"I have owned both versions of the Nintendo DS system and found that I like the DS Lite much less than the older DS, to the point of actually going back and exchanging it for an older model.  The DS Lite is just as much fun and the screens are brighter but I am unhappy with almost all of the changes.

The old DS wasn't anywhere near as pretty as the DS Lite but it was much sturdier.  I am very gentle with my handhelds and the outside of my DS Lite had several scratches after a little over a week, it also had several pixels die on the top screen within the first few days of ownership, a problem I have not had with the older DS.  Overall, the new DS just doesn't feel sturdy, and I feel a little like I might break it if I'm not careful.  The original DS was a system that could take some punishment, a fact that you might want to consider if buying one for a younger child.

While I like the thicker stylus I have found that the touch screen on the DS Lite seems a lot less sensitive than the one on the old DS.  I used to be able to use my finger for games where I would only need to touch the screen on occasion but my DS Lite would not respond to anything but the stylus or very hard and repeated finger taps.  When I placed the same brand of screen protector I used on my original DS for years on the DS Lite the touch screen became completely unresponsive.

The DS Lite comes with a nice piece to stick in the GBA game slot when there is no game in it, some people might not be aware that GBA games do not fit all the way into the DS Lite like they do into the original DS.  Gameboy Advance packs stick out about one centimeter, something that I find very annoying as I liked to leave a GBA game inside my DS and my DS Lite would not fit into a case if I did so I had to take the game out and replace the filler piece when I wanted to put the system away.

The DS Lite is considerably smaller and much thinner than the original and if you are an adult with larger hands this isn't necessarily a good thing.  The buttons are also smaller and I have found them harder to work because of this, especially with some of the new button placements.  I find the start and select buttons harder to use now, especially since they are so tiny.  The D-Pad doesn't seem as responsive.  I also miss the wrist strap that the DS used to come with and liked to carry it that way.  The DS Lite doesn't have one.

Overall, I think that which model of the DS to buy or whether to replace your older DS with a DS Lite is a matter of personal preference.  The DS Lite's big selling point are its brighter screens.  They are noticeably brighter but I never had a problem seeing anything on my original DS and I don't notice that much of a difference except on the highest brightness settings.  I am very happy with the longer battery life and the quicker charge time with the DS Lite but have found that for me it's not worth putting up with the other changes.","Better Form, Worse Function"

B0018YXM3Y,2.0,"So I've been playing this game since it was first released. I played all of the Total War games and I have to say, this game is very disappointing. First, its very buggy, even with all the latest patches applied. When I select my ships, the game crashes to desktop almost all the time.

Second, it takes forever to get to your turn (about 30 minutes wait after you ended your turn). I have a pretty decent CPU (AMD Athlon Dual Core 5000+ 2.6 Ghz) and a decent graphic card (Nvidia 9500GT) and 4GB of RAM. There's just way too many nations and the freaking Ottoman Empire (which is the longest wait of all AI controlled nations) has like over 100 boats in the sea and god knows how many land units it has.

Third, why the hell do they have STEAM client for? STEAM needs to be loaded first before you can load this game. TOTALLY RETARDED!

Forth, not many unique units between nations. Other total war games have variety of units, but not this one.

B00166N6SA,2.0,"Detail in the Sims2 is much better! the houses and furniture in Sims2 look more realistic in detail and texture then the Sims3.

B00166N6SA,2.0,"I started playing city simulator games back when Maxis was its own company and the little pixelated houses and ghetto computer music found in SimCity 2000 reduced us all to a drooling game addict stupor.  Then enter The Sims.  Now we could not only design those pixelated houses but we could decide when the little peons could eat!

The point being that the reason why all these games of the past met with so much success is becuase they were GOD GAMES.  As in, YOU COULD CONTROL EVERYTHING.  Creating a virtual house with a virtual family is just about the purest form of computer game escapism a developer could hope to achieve.  So, why then did Sims 3 try and take that away from me?

Back when The Sims first hit the shelves and the developers were still recovering their speech after seeing all the money pouring in, they decided to try and combine two cash cows into one unstoppable beast: they released Sims Online.  The point of this game was that you create a sim and then interact with other sims/real people.  Sounds good in concept, right?  The sad fact is that this game failed miserably.  People didn't want to talk to other people.  At the end of the day when they came home from school or work, they wanted to control every little aspect of their perfect virtual world and not have some goon mess it up.

The Sims 3 does not have online interaction.  Instead, the game includes all this ""story progression"" garbage.  So if, after playing one family for several days, you actually get bored with them and decide to try a bachelor lifestyle, said family will still continue to ""progress.""  This means they could have four kids (regardless of any childless plans you had for them) when you come back or just be completely gone becuase they ""moved out.""  Ummm.... hello!  If I go out of my way to create a sim, then it sure as heck better stay where I put it.

Another major complaint, and this is not meant to be a racist observation, is that this game seems to have been taken over by Asian teenagers.  I have nothing against Asians.  I actually enjoy the challenge of trying to create different ethnic groups in the create a sim.  But all the hairstyles, for example, look like something a teenage Asian punk would wear.  Which is fine if that's the look I'm trying to go for.  But what about the successful businessman father of 5?  Generally you would go for a more mature well polished look.  No cigar in this game.

While the whole neighborhood interaction feature is really nice, I find it just doesn't compensate for all the other little flaws.  Like how we now have to go to the Sims 3 store and shell out gobs of money simply to fill out the sparsely populated furniture options offered in the game?  Or the fact that the in game graphics (and this is cranked up to the highest setting) are only equal to if not lesser than Sims 2?  Or the fact that the game is glitchy and the sims are slow to react to almost every ""interaction""?  In my book, all these things add up to a very disappointing game play experience.  I believe I will be going back to Sims 2.  Yes, there will be a load screen between home and community lots; but at least that's better than the the load screens it takes to just switch your ""active family"" on Sims 3.",A twenty-something's point of view...
B00FM5IY4W,2.0,"I bought this as part of the Xbox One bundle. It was a digital download included in my purchase. I have played the Forza series before. I played Forza 2 about 5 years ago and it was fairly entertaining. I remember wasting hours upon hours on that game racing and buying cars. It's pretty much the same formula as it was back then -- except it's not. Let's not start with the bad though.

The graphics are beautiful! The cars look great and the light and shading on everything is just really exceptional.

The loading.
Oh, you will load. You will then load some more. You will race a boring race for about 6 minutes or so. You will load some more and stare at your banged-up car. Then you load some more to go back to loading to load the next race. Repeat this cycle for everything.

The repetition - same car, same map (oh let's reverse it!)
You will likely race one car for about 18 races in a row if you're anything like me. If you're anything like me you will also do them in order. They take you through a series but then there are ""bonus"" races. Guess what? Those are the same maps. You're going to do them again!

The restrictions
You get to choose from about 6-10 cars for each series. In the beginning they definitely suck. You can quickly level your first car to an A class or better, but you can't really race it in anything. You can't go beat the pants off some c-class suckers. No, you have to stay in the limitations of whatever you are racing.

The pay-to-win disease
It took me a bit to come to this realization. I mean there are plenty of silly tricks online to earn easy money and they work I am sure. I just haven't felt the need to do it. However, you can also see that it costs 20 dollars to get ""VIP"" so that you get double money on everything. Really? How lame.
Or you need to buy cars with real money. You have to buy these if you want to be the ""best."" I quote that simply because you are not the best if you are one of a few that have spent money on this game and it allows you get the best times. You are probably still very good, but you are not actually competing against everyone. I only discovered this after I checked the leaderboards on a few races and I found that in the top 100 car A and car B are the only ones there and, hold your breath, they are both available for purchase as DLC!

The art
I like that you can do all kinds of modifications to the style of the vehicles like in Forza 2. I just feel like there is a big part missing. This game needs a companion app that lets you draw in game and really simplifies some of the designs. Maybe give a randomizing feature that grabs art from other areas or combines them. I would like to be able to draw and airbrush and just drag things on my ipad like in my drawing programs. I would like to import things from my photos or whatever. It would be cool.

Why am I still playing it?
I have to admit I am a bit neurotic. I am still doing each race one-by-one and completing them to get the gold trophies and attempting to beat my friends' times. However, after about 80 races you have the review above. I am frustrated with the game and the leaderboards don't mean a thing to me. I mostly focus on beating my friends for each race. I have about 1.3 million credits, but don't spend them on anything because I can't really use the cars on anything yet. You can't modify the crappy cars beyond a certain point or it will change your class. Another Xbox One disappointment for me I suppose.",Pay to Win

B001AWIP68,2.0,"The COD series has been pretty popular, trumping that of the Medal Of Honor series. COD 2 and 3 for the 360 were basically the same game (graphics, gameplay, etc.). Then came COD 4 - one of the best looking and playing games for the current generation of systems. The COD WAW was announced...

I knew it would be a WWII game, which was a letdown considering the COUNTLESS WWII games that have been made since the PS1 (MOH, COD, Brothers in Arms, and too many others). The major difference with WAW is that you're also fighting the Japanese - something that has always been missing from WWII games (except MOH Rising Sun) which boggles me. I always thought (and still do) that this is due to political correctness. It's MUCH more politically correct to have a game killing Nazi's. No one can cry racism that way, plus it doesn't hurt Japanese sales. Nice. Sigh...

But at this point in time it's just plain tired. There is nothing new to offer in the realm of killing Nazi's in a WW2 game. There just isn't. It is time to put WWII shooters to rest unless someone can revolutionize the visuals, or something else about the gameplay mechanics. But why not a different war? Why not Vietnam, or Korea, or Desert Storm, or the current conflict in Iraq. Why always WW2? Hello?

Anyway, this game does NOT use COD 4 graphics. In fact not even close. The graphics and gameplay are really no different than COD 2 and 3. Seriously. This game is riding on the namesake coattails of COD 4. If you want this game but don't want to spend sixty bucks on it, the best solution is to spend ten or twenty and just buy COD 2 or 3. Other than some profanity you won't be missing out on anything. I guess I should have done my homework to see that Ubi was not involved in this game.

Apparently at some point in this game, there are zombies. Some kind of zombie Nazi. Again, this has been done and done and done (MOH did it at least once, Castle Wolfenstein did it a few times, etc.). Please game developers - put WWII Nazis and zombies to rest - THERE IS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER!

Conclusion - borderline last gen graphics, almost impossible to discern the enemy from your own troops, and just a boring ho-hum game. Luckily I got this as a gift. I'll be selling mine soon.

What a huge disappointment.",Basically the same as COD 2 and 3 - HUGE letdown after COD 4

B000WMEEBC,2.0,"When people said this was dumbed down they weren't kidding. Is not necessarily the simplicity that makes this game bad, V is simple but it works. This game, I don't really know how to explain it but, it just makes no sense. What's the point of bulding wonders? You can build the same ones over and over again in different cities, it doesn't even matter if the AI build them first. And although they give you some bonuses they still are pointless and not needed at all. No worker unit. Imagine if this game was so dumbed down that the worker isn't an unit, tile improvements are done automatically once your borders grow and they become part of your territory. No auto-explore. That's right, if you want to explore you have to keep moving the unit by yourself, is annoying, btw there are no scouts in this game, you explore with warriors. No open borders. There's simply no way to get pass other civs borders unless you declare war to them, so if one of your units gets stuck between AI borders your only option if to delete it if you don't want to declare them war. Diplomacy is non-existance. I don't even think this game have diplomacy. The AI only talked to me the first time I met them and when they decided to declare me war for stupid reasons. That's it. It feels as if other civs don't exist in this game, you don't feel them, is like you are alone in the world and those other civs are there just to block your pathway. The map is very small. The game pace is always quick. No custom settings. You just choose yor civ and start a game.

It does have some nice things that Civ VI will implement like forming a division with three units and the way cities look in this game is similar to how they will look in Civ VI. I also like how some civs have more than two unique units. But that's about it.

This game feels like it was made for mobile devices and also children. Is too easy. Everything is automatic. And there is no strategy involved. Keep spawing warriors and conquest the whole world in a few turns. I only played one game and I didn't even finish it. I expected more from a Civ game.

B0050JN846,2.0,"I knew when I was getting into purchasing a used version of the collector's edition. All of the pieces would not be included. I do not care about that. I bought this version to play the game because at the time, it was cheaper somehow. To take the discs out, install them and play the game was my only intent.

...Unfortunately that's easier said than done. Whoever designed the inside of this case must not have been thinking straight because I can't even get two of the discs out without fear of snapping them in half. After about 10 minutes of careful fumbling (oxymoron?), I was able to get the 2nd install disc out successfully. The third disc I can't get out because I'm too afraid of breaking it lol. Luckily, it's just the bonus features disc, so I was able to play the game just fine. Still, I'd like to pop in that third disc just out of curiosity, but my paranoia and this poorly designed case prevents me from doing so.

B003O6ECOM,2.0,"Compared to Hot Pursuit this game is horrible!  I thought that HP was probably the best racing game made on the ps3 since its debut.  I really thought it would be hard to screw this game up but they did.  I have played just about all of the NFS series games and this one is by far the worst one yet.

(the review is based on Hot Pursuit)

The story
_ on HP it isn't quite a story but none the less it is fun and you choose events as a racer or cop (had a blast trying to finish this game)

- On the run its a crappy ""race"" across america where is pretty much all the events are you need to pass a set number of cars to rank up on the run leader board.  Also there is cut scenes where you are the racer and escaping some weird situation.  Its very boring and gets old real quick.

Graphics
in both games are perfect as always with EA

Car Handling
- The best way i can put it is HP is an arcade style racer as where the run feels like the shift series...  The cars seem like they are glued to the center of the screen+ drifting in HP was easy and fun but in the run it feels like the cars are boxes that are going 40mph through sand.  i don't know why they changed the handling to the ""shift"" style because the shift series is horrible.  also the cars feel the same if they are going 75-200 there is no difference in the feeling.

rewinds
- To me this is my biggest beef...
in HP if you wrecked, you would just reset where you crashed... but in the run they have this rewind where if you wreck or just slightly get off the track they reset you to the closest check point which is REALLY annoying. So say if there is traffic in both lanes (which happens alot) and you swerve a little off track to avoid this you will most likely be reset for going too far off the road.

To be honest this game is a joke compared to Hot pursuit... The racer vs cop is fun and they should be improving on that rather than go back to the stupid ""stories"" with the fake characters...

B001IK5TJI,2.0,"I have about 30 games for each of the PS2 and PS3, and have finished them all until this one.  The last game I gave up on was probably on the PS1.  I really thought I was going to like Dragon Age Origins (DAO), but didn't.  Strangely, I bought it with Demon's Souls (DS), and was sure I'd like DAO but not DS (was giving it a try anyway).  It was the opposite.  I loved DS, but DAO just couldn't keep my interest.

My first impression of this game was a feeling of being overwhelmed.  There are so many spells, abilities and tactics.  I eventually got the hang of it, and was sure that I was then ready to play.  But the feeling of being overwhelmed continued.  There are so many items and pieces of equipment you can buy but you have very limited money, which turned me off completely.  Some people might like all of that choice, but psychological studies show that too much choice in anything in life can turn some people off, and that's what it did to me.  Then you add to that the constant addition of new quests to complete, and it starts getting out of hand.  I'm trying to complete one quest and the game adds 6 more.  I'm trying to make my quest list shorter, but it multiplied several times.  Let me finish one first!  To make it even worse, you often have to go long stretches before you can get to a shop to sell extra gear, and you get so many items from enemies and chests that you have to start leaving stuff on the ground.  If you do want to pick something up, you have to go into micro-managing mode, discarding items from your inventory, while you curse the game for not giving you a shop to unload at.  Overwhelming and frustrating.

The menu interface is slow and awkward and the battles are pretty lame.  Having just completed Demon's Souls immediately before playing this game, Dragon Age just seems weak in the combat department.  I don't mind the low-end graphics so much.  It also takes forever to start, as it wants to check for downloadable content each time you start the game from the menu screen and then it checks the Dragon Age servers, which it was never able to log me into even once, despite the fact that I made an account with them in-game and had it confirmed to my email.

So when did I give up on DAO?  On the quest to the mages' tower.  You think it's going to be fairly straight-forward, but it ends up turning into a super-long quest with no chance to re-supply your diminishing health potions, no party to help you, and some frustrating battles.  I died over and over again and the load times drove me nuts.  I got pretty bored, and the game was becoming a chore to play.  Even though I was nearly finished the quest and could see the light at the end of the tunnel, I hit the eject button.  I'm not sure if I'll go back to it or not.

B005I0H08W,2.0,"First off, I should say that I'm working on a Mac and haven't had a chance to try this out on a PC.  My experience with my Mac has been quite frustrating.  After working with it for a while and trying to make it work for me, I've given up and it's now in the drawer where my old and obsolete electronics go to die.  I tried using this on an iMac (for which I already have the Apple Magic Mouse).  I thought this might make a nice alternative - even though you can use gestures on the Magic Mouse I find it more intuitive to have a right click button and a scroll wheel, so I thought this would be perfect.  It turns out, though, it doesn't work all that well as a mouse.  First of all, it's got a fairly primitive optical sensor (that turns out to employ a very bright red laser-type light) and requires the use of a mouse pad, something I haven't needed for a long time.  If I move it on my desktop (which is solid white) it doesn't register at all.  Even with a mouse pad I found that it wasn't as sensitive as I'm used to.  With the Magic Mouse I don't have that problem, and it registers even the slightest movement on any flat surface.  You can also shift it into presentation mode, where it can control music or slides on a Powerpoint presentation.  That's a bit more useful, but not really a function I use much.  I could see using it as a remote for controlling music, but since it takes a moment to shift it into that mode and since I rarely listen to music on the computer except when I'm at the keyboard, I find it easier just to use keystrokes.

I thought the gamepad on the back would make a nice addition but I haven't found it any way to get it to work with any of the games I play on or offline - it would help if there were a website or forum somewhere that explained which games it's supposed to be compatible with on different platforms.  As far as I can tell there isn't any such site, and I can't find help on this anywhere online.  I can get it to switch into that mode but it doesn't seem to control anything.  I tried, for example, to set it up to work with Portal, by putting it in gamepad mode, and then assigning the buttons manually, but my Mac wouldn't register its buttons.  Since it's supposed to be driverless, I'm not sure what I could be doing wrong.  Anyhow, at this point I've lost interest in getting this to work for me.  It's not a very good mouse, not as good as many others I've used over the years, and I can't figure out how to use its other features besides the presentation mode that I don't find all that useful (but might be useful to some); the instructions that came with it are not all that helpful, and I can't find any additional instructions online.  If anyone had a different experience with this mouse on a Mac, I'd love to hear a comment and explanation, and if I figure out it's just me making a stupid mistake I'll happily update my review (even if I don't really believe a product like this should be susceptible to stupid mistakes, and really should be mostly self-explanatory - since that's the whole appeal of a mouse and of game controllers generally: you should just get it).","Frustrating (on my Mac) ...

What does annoy me, however, is that the same can be said for Vista, an operating system listed right on the back of the packaging, and on in the description. Doesn't seem that the drivers needed came with the packaged disc, and after installing drivers I got online, the item seemingly chooses when it does and does not want to work on my Vista machine.

B00006JZXR,2.0,"""EverQuest: Planes Of Power"" was obviously designed to cater to ""Uber-Guilds,"" an expression used in the EverQuest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience, and large in numbers. The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the ""Planes of Power"" zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were ""nerfed"" by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to ""better balance the classes."" It is far more likely that those ""nerfs"" were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.
Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered ""gear"" that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in ""PoP."" Introducing too much ""uber gear"" to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined ""Diablo 2"" when the ""Lord of Destruction"" expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to ""better balance the classes."" If anything is true about ""Planes of Power,"" it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.
Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the ""Plane of Time"" endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a ""must have"" for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as ""Scars Of Velious"" or ""Shadows Of Luclin"" so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, ""Planes Of Power"" is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the ""muscle"" required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.
Lastly, ""The Planes Of Power"" tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. ""PoP"" is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  ""Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line."" Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.
Thumbs down overall, but a necessary add-on for all EverQuest players.",First Of The Post-Verant Letdowns
B00VU4J13W,2.0,"I am dissapointed. I have played every single COD game, every one, except for Cod 1, the game in 2001 that started it all.

B002EWD02C,2.0,"I bought this game with high expectations. Aggregates scores from professional reviewers put Might and Magic among the highest rated RPG's ever for the DS. Unfortunately it didn't even come close to meeting my expectations; in fact there were moments in the game where I seriously loathed it.

**** THIS SECTION INCLUDES SOME POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****
My first issue is with how completely linear the game is. Not only is the plot linear but even your very footsteps are linear. There is almost no freedom in movement. You move from space to space in a very stiff fashion. As with every RPG that has ever existed you start the game at level 1 and work your way up. I leveled my character up and finished the first section of the game only to be given control of a NEW character starting back at level 1. After leveling this one up, I got a third character again at level 1. I Leveled up and was given a FOURTH character at level 1. By the time I reached my FIFTH new character the game was kind enough to start me at level 7 for whatever reason. You can only ever level up to 10 maximum which again puts serious limitations on what you can do in the game. Finally, let me say that fighting an opponent several levels higher is nearly impossible and several levels below is very easy and often boring. All of this adds up to the most claustrophobic and constrained RPG I have ever played.
**** END OF SPOILERS ****

I haven't played a lot of RPG's on the DS because very few have gotten better than mediocre scores so maybe I'm out of touch but I did not expect to see load times at the beginning of battles. I think back to GTA on the DS which created an entire city for the player and still maintained an excellent frame rate yet Might and Magic needs a few seconds to set up a small battle. The combat itself is something I've never seen before in an RPG and it's probably the greatest strength of the game. The battlefield is essentially a grid that operates somewhat similar to Tetris or Doctor Mario. Get three creatures of the same color in a row and you can create a wall or a battle unit that can attack the opposition. There are also more powerful creatures that can be used to attack when combined with smaller creatures of the same color. It's fun for awhile but about halfway through the game it started growing tedious and tiresome. The game is sort of a hybrid RPG/puzzle but it doesn't do either exceptionally well and in the case of the RPG I would argue it performs poorly.

This is the most disappointing video game I have played since `No More Heroes' on the Wii which was another dud that got great reviews from professional reviewers. I never got into the story one bit. Switching from character to character only left me caring about none of them and the game committed one of the worst infractions a game can commit, it became a chore to play. I kept expecting that I would get past the slow start and the game would pick up but it never did and when I defeated the final boss I was pleased to put the game away for good. I really regret buying this one instead of the new Zelda game for the DS.",Unbelievably Overrated
B000ZK6950,2.0,"This was a game that was either hit or miss or so I thought. It falls spmewhere in between. The graphics are beautiful and as smooth as I have seen on any next gen game. The detail uses the full power of the 360 and the result is impressive. However there are some glichs along the way. They are few and far between but we have come expect such things to be corrected by now. Example. When you shoot a zombie and he falls against a wall and half of his body dissppears into the wall and the other half lays there continoulsy twitching. Maybe I am knit picking but come on. This is a glich that should have been delt wih years ago. The camera sometimes seems to working againts you.

B0010AYJXI,2.0,"I'm a big fan of Remedy Games. I thought Max Payne II was on the short list for best game of the year back when it was released in 2003, along with the original Prince of Persia and Freedom Fighters. What Max Payne II had going for it was a gritty, neo-noir plot, a highly stylized way of storytelling, memorable characters, a distinct sense of localization and attention to detail, insightful parody, and wildly surrealistic moments. Who could ever forget the Funhouse level, or Max's nightmarish descent to madness as the the walls between reality and his inner torment blended and became indistinguishable from one another? It was these kinds of audacious and fearless storytelling moments that really made a core number of gamers dedicated Max Payne II fans, even if the majority of people slept on the game.

Fastforward to this past week, when I played Alan Wake for the first time after Steam offered it at a deep discount of 90% off. I missed out on Alan Wake back when it was released in 2010 because I didn't have XBox or a gaming PC at the time, and now I was glad to be able to play this game which was in many ways should've been the spiritual successer to the Max Payne franchise.

After five hours of gameplay.. I am very disappointed. Alan Wake tries to execute some of the best ideas of Max Payne II, most notably depicting a person's inner descent to madness in the gaming medium and the use of incidental and tangental in-game TV shows and radio broadcasts to flesh out the game proper, but most of the things that Alan Wake tries to imitate from Max Payne II fall spectacularly flat.

The combat fails to evolve despite a variety of weapons and enemies, and every encounter feels the same since there is very little difference between a handgun or a shotgun, a flare or a flash grenade, they all do basically the same thing which is kill the shadowy horde of enemies.

The story, and therefore the game, progresses at an incredibly slow pace. SPOILER alert. Alice is kidnapped within the first hour of gameplay, and a kidnapper appears soon after to make a ransom demand of an unwritten manuscript from Alan Wake. The audience is informed that Cauldron Lake is somehow a gateway between realities and the fiction that Alan Wake writes somehow changes reality. However, after learning that information and making your way to the kidnapper to hand him the manuscript in exchange for Alice, the story is not developed AT ALL and you spend the next three hours progressing from point A to point B trying to get to the kindapper with no plot progression. It grinds the story to a complete halt and made me lose all interest.

The in-game TV show, which was so brilliant in Max Payne II, reprises here on Alan Wake in the form of the TV episode ""Night Springs."" All the episodes of ""Night Springs"" appear as if they are failed scripts from ""The Twilight Zone."" They are not interesting, thoughtful, or provocative as the TV shows from Max Payne II. They are very dull.

And speaking of dull, the radio broadcasts are the worse! They do not contribute to an atmosphere or mood at all. It is as boring as watching the Weather Channel on a sunny day, and that's because the broadcast actually talks about the weather!

All in all, a very disappointing 'spiritual successor' to the Max Payne legacy.","Not the spiritual success of Max Payne II.  Neither the video game we needed, nor deserved."

B000A3IA0Y,2.0,"In it's lifetime the Nintendo Entertainment System is going to have some issues. The original NES-001 system uses a 72 pin connector in the system that relies on pressure for the game cartridges to maintain contact with the system's pins so that you can play games. Over time these pins wear out and loose their springy-ness, which often results in the dreaded blinking Nintendo syndrome, or DBNS for short.

Some things you can do to try and fix this is to give your Nintendo an overall cleaning, including the inside and the 72 pin connector. Using a tooth brush and some rubbing alcohol scrub out any dirt you may see and make sure you scrub both ends of the 74 pin connectors and the connections on the board itself. A dirty Nintendo is an unhappy Nintendo. While you are at it, clean all your games out as well, use the same method. After you are done, let it all air dry, if it still smells of rubbing alcohol, it needs to dry longer.

If that doesn't work it means it is the pins itself, you could always open up your Nintendo and attempt to bend the pins back into place yourself, or you can buy a new NES 72 pin connector. I've bent the pins on my 72 pin connector myself a few times and while it maybe a temporary fix, I've never had any long lasting effects, eventually I have to bend them back into place again and you need to be careful, it's really easy to break or over bend the pins.

This product, ""NES 72 Pin Connector (Bulk Packaging)"" doesn't really do what it's supposed to do, which is offer a brand new 72 pin connector that works the first time every time. The pins were very loose in the 72 pin connector, instead of working every time like they should, it'd work every two or three tries. On a recommendation from a friend I pulled out the new replacement 72 pin connector and simplify boiled my old original 72 pin connector. Imagine my surprise when it worked flawlessly every single time.

Another problem is the Nintendo itself, the Nintendo is really fickle when it comes to being taken apart and being put back together again. You need to make sure you put your Nintendo back together exactly the way you found it. All it takes is a missing screw or something not being aligned up perfectly and it won't work, it'll start blinking again. This is a problem I had, I noticed that the screws weren't screwed all the way in for the tray the NES games sit in, and that was causing DBNS for me. When you put it all back together, the Nintendo lid should be able to simply gently fall right back into place, if it isn't, there's something wrong, something isn't the way it should be, you need to take apart your Nintendo and make sure it was put together right.

Long story short, although these pins advertised are brand new, they are made out of low quality parts and doesn't work like it should. Stick to cleaning out your original pins and save time and money.",Not very reliable.
B0009VXBAQ,2.0,"The Nintendo Wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it.  A drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology.  A claim, that I believed as well.  The idea of playing games with motions is intriguing, enticing, and exciting, something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console.  I was one of the many people who waited in line all night November 18, 2006 for the Nintendo Wii.

After taking it home that first morning, I was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by Nintendo.  I opened the console, I liked what I saw.  The Wii Menu is unique, and is a great way to navigate the console.  The menu displays the contents of the Wii's internal hard-drive, displaying items such as downloaded games, and new channels that may have been purchased.  Navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the Wii Remote at the screen to choose the desired channel.

The games feel unique at first, requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games.  However, as time goes by, the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium.  After a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action.  For example: in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press ""A"" but the Wii replaces this with a simple ""shake"" of the controller.  It doesn't even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either, seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions.  The majority of the games on the Wii really only use five different gestures, simply recycled over and over again.  These gestures include: shake controller left, shake controller right, shake controller up, shake controller down, and thrust controller forward.  These gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game, since these gestures are no different than button pressing.  The added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as well.

Where I started to lose faith in the Wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console.  I began by purchasing Resident Evil 4, Okami, Madworld, No More Heroes, Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 2 and 3, Twilight Princess, and more.  I started to realize that with these games, precision is an absolute must.  However, the Wii remote's motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller.  This results in lag, delayed moves, incorrect moves, and more.  In several of these games, I found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the Wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves.  For example:  in Twilight Princess, the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward, however, sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack.  Similar scenarios began to play out with all of the Wii games I purchased.  Every game began to get more frustrating and I began to play my Playstation 3 more and more.  Finally, I came to a conclusion, traditional controls just work better for playing games, period.

The graphics of the Wii are fine, in my opinion, despite the lack of HD.  Graphics alone do not make a game fun, and that is why I continue to play PSOne and Nintendo 64 games to this day.  However, the unresponsive controller gestures of the Wii are enough to turn me away from the console.  I'm still hoping that Microsoft and Sony don't try to follow Nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play.  If you're a gamer looking for a console with great games, is a lot of fun, and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control, don't go with the Wii.  You can't go wrong with either a PS3 or a 360 though, both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to.  The Wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl, Guilty Gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a GameCube controller, but not enough games give players this option.  Also, if you're not looking for games that contain in depth controls, than perhaps you will do just fine with the Wii.  The Wii has its ups, and its downs, but for me personally, it has been a disappointment.",Fun At First....But Due to Bad Gimmick....Gets Old Fast
B00HKCITCC,2.0,"Even before you get into ""The Game"" you've got a bunch of unskippable videos of company logos to go through, before you get to the intro video that is skippable if you hover over the press the awkwardly placed ""skip"" button. When you do that you're treated to...additional loading before you get to the actual menu.

From here, you have an awkward console-ported to PC interface. You know the kind where the mouse feels like it downed about 10 shots of Jager before the game. It's not smooth, it's quicker in some directions than in others, it's not enough to merely place the cursor over the button you want to press, but you have to find the ""sweet spot"" to actually activate it (because someone spent all of 4 seconds doing a sloppy conversion from gamepad to mouse interface). All that's when you're lucky enough for the cursor to even show up, which is a fairly common problem (judging from my experience and a lot of other reviews).

This shows the general level of polish the game has.

The match making is horrendous. It takes about 5-10 mins to find a match. I think I've only started a match from the beginning two out of the fifteen or so rounds I've played. More likely than not you'll end up getting dumped into a game midstream, usually because someone left, and that side is getting its butt kicked. i.e. you're a first-stage monster stuck in an arena with 20% of your health left, or you port into a dead guy watching the one last surviving teammate getting pummeled by the monster. It's very confusing because it's often a character you'll have no experience how to use ...and I still don't know every time I'm the monster the skills are different/inconsistent (perhaps this mystery would be solved if I got to start a match for once).

Theoretically the group stays together for another round, but all I get is a screen that says ""waiting for players to load"" or some such for eternity. Well, ok, I've never waited longer than about 25 minutes before finally exiting out (for which you are penalized for doing so by the way).

In the even that you get to play the game for longer than 30 seconds before it's game over (and an infinite wait screen) you'll find the usual problem. If your a hunter, your teammates suck. Trackers think they're assault and don't use tethering or arena skills, healers think they're assault and only use their offensive weapon without ever healing, support think's it's assault and only uses its offensive weapon, and assault...well, those guys usually do ok. I suppose this can't really be blamed on the game...that's just the nature of pickup groups on the internet.

Perhaps in general most of the above problem can be avoided if you can manage to group up with some friends before embarking on the game. If you were hoping to drop into a group of unknowns...well: I wouldn't recommend it.

Additionally, there are other issues with the structure of the game. It appears to be setup for a rather long grind. each class type only has one character available initially. You have to acquire so many points with the different skills to unlock to the next hunter in that class. Perhaps it goes quicker if you can start a match from the beginning, but at my ""join game in progress for 30 seconds before its over"" pace, it would likely take me 40-50 hrs to unlock another character.

You can read any of the other 10,000 negative reviews griping about the DLC issues with the game as well. I'm sure at least one of them has expressed the issues with that more eloquently than I could.",Another lackluster console port to PCs.
B0015HZLVA,2.0,"I've played 4 TALES games counting this one. TALES of Symphonia, Legendia, Abyss and now Vesperia. By far Vesperia is the worst Tales game I've played. There are many things I didn't like about the game.

1. The graphics for this game weren't very good.

2. The story wasn't captivating. It just didn't keep me interested in the game. I know they used the environmental theme for the game. They could have done a much better job with the theme and the story. If you want a great game that tackles that theme get Final Fantasy VII. I had to try real hard to get through the game.

3. The characters were terrible. I wasn't interested or cared about any of them. Yuri was uninteresting and came off as a cold hearted bastard, not good for the lead character of a RPG. Estelle was just boring and I didn't care about her story. Karol and Rita just didn't add anything to the game. Raven started out well in the game and I did like him. I wanted him to stay dead, it was just a great ending for his character, but now they decided to bring him back to life, what a rip.

The only characters I did like were Judith. I thought Judith and Yuri would get together, they were a much better than Yuri and Estelle, and I think it would have made Yuri more interesting, but the creators didn't take the game in that direction. I also liked Repede, he was just a fun character and they way he interacted with the other characters. My favorite character in the game was a minor character and turns out to be on of the bad guys. Yes it's Duke. I really like his story and character. At the end of the game I actually wanted him to win some how, even though I knew it wasn't possible.

Oh yes did I mention was a let down of a ending. Talk about a waste of my time.

I am really disappointed with Namco/Bandai. I have really liked the TALES games until this one. It's just really sad.

1. TALES OF ABYSS: 10
2. TALES OF SYMPHONIA: 9
3. TALES OF LEGENDIA: 8
4. TALES OF VESPERIA: 4",I was expecting more from a TALES game. I was truly disappointed.

B00001ZT9E,2.0,"I, like most who have played this game, am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series.  I especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the action/adventure element and increased pace of the second one.  This series starts off promisingly enough.  Outside of a mandatory (groan) training level, the game eases you into the tried-and-true Tomb Raider gameplay we all have grown to love.  The environments are large and exciting, the puzzles clever.  Exploration is fun and rewarding, and progress is logical.  For the first 6 or 7 hours.  The challenge level really picks up after the VERY neat train level, and in fact starts to become downright maddening.  Do we really have to backtrack for 3 hours just to find 7 scattered items required to make it through to the next level?  Things get flat-out obnoxious at the Chambers Of Tulun and the Trenches.  This area goes something like this: rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room.  Go to the Citadel Gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister.  Return to the Chambers and go to the Trenches.  Obtain the nitrous oxide feeder.  Return to the Chambers of Tulun to obtain the roof key.  Go back to the Trenches to get to the Street Bazaar.  Get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the Trenches.  And so on and so on and so on.  Is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary?  I really enjoy the high challenge level of the Tomb Raider series, but this is ridiculous.  If I didn't have a strategy guide with me, I wouldn't have made it to the Citadel (which is where I am right now).  This game is loads of fun for about 20 or 25 levels; afterwards, it becomes a chore to play.  The graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first Tomb Raider, and the legendary level design has regressed considerably.  Many spots feel cheap, rather than challenging.  Control, while still functional, still isn't perfect, and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nerve-wracking.  If you miss and survive, then you have to make another series of jumps, which can take another 10 minutes just to get back to where you originally were.  I could go on and on, but this game is just too much.  Get this only if you're a die-hard TR fan; but be prepared to fork out some extra cash for a strategy guide.",Should come with horseshoes

B0002I9RRM,2.0,"For someone who hasn't played video games since Super Nintendo it wasn't hard for me to desire more from todays gaming systems.  I went on a spree and purchased the gamecube and Nintendo 64 from Amazon and found that the games have changed significantly over the years.  Exception:  I bought NBA Live 2002, 2003, and 2005.  The first one I purchased for the Nin 64 and turned out just as I expected.  Gameplay was somewhat tedious yet still entertaining.  The 2003 for Gamecube was nice.  Good streaming gameplay, competitive modes, occasionally I even had to think on defense.  So naturally I expected the 2005 to be CRAZY NICE.  It was NOT.  It is cartoonish.  The camera angles are horrible.  The players heads are large as if to make it easier to see their faces.  And now you have to earn skills in the NBA?  Please EA go back to the formula you had for 2003.  I will be ridding myself of 2005 as soon as I can simply because I'm having considerably more fun with the 2003 version.

B00ZE369I0,2.0,"Just rented this last week. As an owner of an xbox one without a kinect I was intrigued by the possibility to use a cell phone instead of the kinect. I thought the JD app would use the phone's camera in place of the kinect to track the dancer's moves. I was wrong. It's more like a controller for a nintendo wii. You shake your hand around and it supposedly tracks your moves. My son tried it and just shook it around randomly as a joke and the game kept saying ""Perfect!"". I have an xbox 360 with kinect and love the Dance Central games. Maybe if MS would make more xbox one games for kinect I would spend the extra money for it. But, since they've seemed to abandon the technology altogether for games, it's not worth it to me.
Also, if you're having trouble getting the app on your phone to connect with your xbox one (as I did) you may have to go to Settings and set Smartglass to accept all devices. Worked for me after hours of frustration trying to get it to work. Good luck!
And lastly, the game said I could get a free month of JD Unlimited: ""Press here for the code"". I pressed the button and nothing happened. Turns out, a week later a code showed up in my email. A week? Just ridiculous. Glad I rented the game first and only wasted $3 instead of $40. Will stick to Dance Central on the 360 with kinect.",Needs Kinect.

B00CX7FQ4I,2.0,"This game is pretty bad.  The XBOX 360 Undisputed game beats it in both game play and graphics (sometimes)!  Which is unacceptable.

The fighters in this game are not rendered that well.  Their faces are not bad.  But some of the bodies are laughable.  You get big tough guys with skinny bodies.  I've seen CAW's of UFC fighters in the WWE games that look better than these pro-created fighters.  Not joking one bit here.

Plus, the game play is slow and has this weighed down feel.  As if every move is a chore.  Grappling is boring.  Clinching is boring.

The fighters are dopey and clumsy looking in the ring, and they do not react to hits realistically.  This game is basically Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots for the digital age.

Career mode is REALLY boring and full of training requirements.  You basically do everything BUT fight.  It's a waiting game that is VERY annoying.  I do not have the time to sacrifice to BS.  Let's FIGHT!

If you need a UFC game that is fun, 360's Undisputed is better--but not by THAT much.  The 360 game seems more fluid and less of a chore to enjoy.  Even the training modes are better--yet still annoying.

I have beaten all of the games in the tony hawk series but I just couldn't will myself into playing this for more than a half hour. The primary flaw in this game is the story mode (or lack there of). The story mode starts completely randomly and has very little meaning due to the lack of cut scenes and poor concept. It starts by you getting kidnapped sounds intriging right? Wrong! The next cut scene shows bam and tony standing over you and tell you that for no reason at all they want to go on a world destruction tour. Ok the concepts still got you hooked but not for long. So you head off to a get acquainted level and then to BOSTON. Thats still just fine with me I'm still slightly interested. Now this is where the boat sinks.m Youre skater has a list of goals that have absolutely no meaning at all. Go find this Guy in the level. What kind of mission id that and how does that relate to freakin skating. Other missions are very similar in the fact that they don't relate to skating. These missions are designed to be destructive and punk-like yet their just not entertaing. One of the new features is being able to switch characters on the run but they are often hard to unlock and their id a new set of goals with each character. Even if you liked the idea of switching characters it's impossible to switch and then switch back because you have to find a specific spot where your skaters are stationed and they are completely random. When you complete a level there bassicly is no significance to the following cut scene it just tells you about the next level. All the theatrical elements in the plot of THUG just dissapeer in THUG2 and I can't understand why. There is no reason to be doing what your doing theres no rival because you have to keep switching teams and the levels are horrible compared to THUG. The only reason to by this game would be for classic mode which follows the THPS format and is still fun. I've been playing Tony hawk games since the original in 98 and have loved them all. I absolutely adored THUGS concept and was able to complete that game in under 24 hours while loving every seconed of it. This is just not the way to follow up a game of the year Neversoft as a fan I'm upset with the lack of creativity. The comparison is pathetic but I'll give you my opinion of the score card anyway.

B000BYQJCI,2.0,"I found a number of problems in this first unpatched PC release of SC:DA, and a few style changes that makes the game feel more like a console game than PC:

- Can't customize mouse buttons, they are fixed on fire and alt-fire

- Unlockable items don't unlock

- While using pistol to disrupt a light, I was not able to holster the pistol until I fired a shot from it.

- After I knock out a person the game forces me to pick him up.  I don't want to pick up a person every time I choke them down.

- Game runs much slower than previous SC games.

A few interface changes I didn't like, which are subjective:

- Sam looks like a walking traffic light

  For the stealth indicator, a component on Sam's suit turns bright red, yellow or green to determine how visible he is.  This indicator takes immersion away from the character since it looks silly to see an agent walk around with a bright-colored light emitting from his back.  It looks like he is trying to direct traffic rather than sneak around.

- Interaction interface uses big icons instead of text-based menu as in the previous games.  It's annoying to guess what icons are what when quickly trying to pick an option, and I found the text-based options from previous versions better.

Graphically the game does look good with HDR, and levels appear more detailed.

Overall there should be more options and customization available for PC users since customization is an advantage of the PC platform. Ubisoft should have left the game to cook longer with QA before release.

Game loses 1 star for bad QA, 1 star for performance, and 1 star for lack of PC control customization.  If you have to buy the game, buy it used.  Who knows if and when ubisoft will patch the game to make it more enjoyable for PC customers.

B00X87O5T4,2.0,"I don't normally give 2 stars nor write game reviews. But since I am a big fan of this game series since its start back in 2008, I thought it would be unfair for UBISOFT to continue ruining this game. And here is why this game deserves even less than 2 stars:

1- The new combat system is not dynamic and out of control. You cannot really manage killing opponents the way you really want to. Switching among whomever you're fighting is a nightmare and killing them is just a coincidence or just a rush experience every time, I would call it. I remember that this was the most fun part of the game, that you have full control on how to grab and kill enemies.

2. The game is too big and its environment is nice but mission and side mission are scattered all over the huge map. There is no solid, good story in it. Every mission is isolated. So you keep loading and loading every time you start something - you reach your destination, then the game loads that mission or scenario for you, then you finish it, and move to the next. This is not fun and boring. It is like you're playing small, small games within one big game. There is no continuity nor suspense. Missions are too easy and never challenging but rather short and boring.

3. I don't see much difference between the skills of the two characters nor special abilities that really matter. Only the appearance and the stupid bazaar canvases and outfits that you spend your money on buying which add no value or whatsoever.

4- I did not enjoy the game because I felt that it is very repetitive and isolated. The story-line is weak and boring. Even characters are all look alike. it is like 10 years old game. That's a shame!

I do not really recommend this game to anyone. BORING! BORING! BORING!",BORING!

B000FRU1UM,2.0,"There's no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success. We all know it was well received by the public, got great reviews and made Rockstar even richer.

So how does it play? Was it worth the wait? Should it have waited even longer? Maybe and absolutely.

The game does an admirable job of representing what is basically New York and having a sympathetic lead who kills, steals and double-crosses to survive. He doesn't like what he does, wishes he didn't have to do it, but in order to fulfill his objective, he has to do these things. (Note that the vast majority of people he kills, steals from and double-crosses aren't even worthy of being called scum.) The game also forces the player to make some hard choices which have long-lasting consequences. And of course, true to form for a GTA game, there's weapons, explosions, sex, car chases, gun fights and profanities aplenty.

Which leads me to the first of many letdowns for this game. The missions are so repetitive, so tedious, so monotonous, and so boring that it is literally impossible to truly differentiate one mission from the next. A good 50% of the game, probably more involves shooting endless waves of enemies, many of whom pop up in completely illogical places. It is very easy for one enemy to kill you in a matter of seconds after having done so well up to that point.

Which brings me to my next point: Mission failures. The system Rockstar put in place is by far the worst system in any AAA video game, and budget titles would do well to stay far from this as well. If you fail a mission, you must restart the mission entirely. From the beginning. Every single time. It doesn't matter if the mission is a single chase, a single shootout or if there is more than one part to it. (The final mission has five parts to it.) If something goes wrong, you start back at the beginning and you have to redo the entire thing all over again. There are no mid-mission checkpoints. This is completely inexcusable.  Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, so video games have had checkpoints in them for at least seven years now and probably longer than that. Please don't put in a comment about how I forgot about how X game had them in 199X. I am not interested, I am only using that particular game as an example. That's it. End of discussion.

And yet, when you do restart, you still lose EVERYTHING you used in the mission. Why is that? Why should I have to replenish everything I lost on something that didn't actually happen? I can't think of any game that does this, and I probably wouldn't want to play such a game, mainly because I prefer games that are fun. Is having to restock ammo and armor on a mission that didn't actually just happen fun? No. That's downtime, and downtime isn't fun, especially when it's needless downtime. And Rockstar isn't based in someone's garage. This is a very large company with a huge budget, so these amateurish design decisions are even more inexcusable.

Speaking of inexcusable design decisions that were antiquated long, long ago, let's discuss another aspect of gun fights. For some reason, when Niko is being shot at, his default speed, running or walking is the exact same speed as when nothing is going on. SWAT 3 came out almost NINE YEARS AGO, and that game had a dynamic speed change. In other words, if shots were fired, everyone sped up. Not Niko. No, he'll just wander around unless you actually hit the run button. Which also makes him run just as fast as though nothing is going on. Wouldn't someone who is trying to find cover so they don't get shot move faster than if they aren't in danger? If you'd like a more recent example of what Rockstar should have done, take a look at Mass Effect.

The driving mechanics also have a much higher learning curve than what it needs to be, especially with motorcycles and helicopters. Why Rockstar didn't take more time honing the controls and making them easier to pick up is anyone's guess. Same with ladders. I have a friend who will tap the Y button until his thumb is ready to break and even still Niko will not climb the ladder that is right in front of him. This is usually after swimming a ridiculous distance to it since the game doesn't allow the player to just suicide and spawn at the nearest hospital. No instead we have to swim ridiculously long distances. Talk about fun huh?

Which is about the same as can be said for multiplayer. You just walk or drive around the city. There is nothing to do. Nothing. No activities, no places to go, nothing. There are some missions that can be done but if you just want to free roam with a friend in multiplayer, that's ALL you get to do. A drop-in, drop-out co-op in the story mode would've been much, much better.

Oh, yeah, the story. Well what little there is isn't too bad, when the game actually allows you to see it. Most of the time it's too busy bogging you down with those same repetitive missions I talked about earlier where it always goes the exact same way - a deal that shouldn't have any problems where Niko is just there ""as insurance"" turns into a battle ground with lots and lots of enemies, then just they're all dead, more spawn in the area that was just cleared, then the fight leads to a car/motorcycle chase which leads to a police chase, lather, rinse, repeat. Almost all of the missions have this exact same format. The only things that change are the goons' clothing and the SET of lines Niko yells out as he kills them (not the actual lines themselves.) So don't worry kids, if you heard him say something in a mission, he will say it again! And again....and again....and again.

And lastly, for some reason even though games have been doing this for years, GTA IV still allows objects that obstruct your view of the player to remain opaque. Every other high quality title I have ever seen that operates in 3rd person forces such obstructions to go transparent.

The characters Niko takes missions from and/or befriends are your stock cardboard cutouts but let's face it, no one plays a GTA game for the character study. That's why we have those....um....what're those things called, libraries have them....oh well. Anyway, the dialogue is at times rather humorous, especially when Niko is hanging around Brucie. I think we've all known a Brucie at some point in our lives, so to see Niko indirectly poke fun at these guys is a treat. And as usual, GTA IV satirizes many aspects of society and pop-culture that are just begging for it. Celebrities, radio-talk show hosts, gossip magazines, plenty of entertainment venues and the masses that support them all get the healthy shot of parody that has been coming to them for years.

With a whole lot more polish, mid-mission checkpoints and far less repetition, GTA IV would deserve the accolades and commercial success it has enjoyed as of late. As it stands, however, it is yet another proof that hype, a big name label and commercial success do not always mean a great game. It is a good game, but nothing more.",Rockstar's Not So Grand Opus
B001AS4TTE,2.0,"I had a lot of misgivings before I bought this game, and I should have trusted them, but some of the reviews talked about realistic handling, including those who compared it to Gran Turismo.  I did not find that to be the case - I thought the handling was poor, lacking in feedback, and frustratingly slow to respond (and the worst is that clanging sound when you try to downshift, no matter how carefully and nowhere near the rev limiter, it will refuse to change gears about a third of the time so there's always an extra couple of paddle clicks).  All the same negatives already mentioned regarding the audio and AI as well.  If you have True Crime LA or NYC you know what things work well with Activision, and what things don't work so great.  I really wanted to like this game because of all the tracks it contains; alas I never was able to get past the handling and enjoy very many of them.

Not recommended unless you're a diehard Ferrari fan.",Another disappointment from Activision
B0013E9HP6,2.0,"The only game I play on this is the target practice game. The other games are worthless with the exception of the tanks, which is no better than any flash animation version you can play for free online. The target practice game is only good with a gun attachment of some sort. I use the Perfect Shot. I got this because it came with a Remote. This version does not, and thus, is not worth it. 2 stars because the shooting is fun, and you don't have to bother with any other game to get to it... which reminds me... you cant play ANY other game on this, until you have played the previous game on the disk. Tanks is last, so if you want to get to that you have to play the awkward ping-pong, the slow and sloppy pool, and you have to race some mentally challenged cows with clumsy controls, along with some other worthless games. Least you don't need a good score to pass them...",The shooting is the only thing worth the cost.
B00503E8S2,2.0,"The maps for mp are really bizarre.  Although they are small to medium small they are cluttered with chokepoints, objects to head glitch upon and elevated positions. Many of the maps resemble mazes. Also there about 70 uav's called in a game because of the support KS loadout making it pretty much radar always on, forcing you to use assassin and not be able to use the other perks.  It is probably one of the most unbalanced and camp heavy COD's ever due to poor maps.  They don't have any nice open small/medium maps like highrise, terminal, scrapyard etc that would have been awesome to play on w/o the noob tubes etc of mw2.  Instead they replaced one problem with another due to poor map design.

This game had tons of potential as well, for smaller maps are what people love but these maps are just designed for head glitching and camping chokepoints (which are far too prevalent.) Forget about rushing, you have to move very tactically and camp if you want a high K/D and it is much slower than black ops.  In this sense this game if anything is too much like Battlefield 3 with the excessive camping, and I'm not a big fan of that.  Don't just take my word for it LVG teepee a pro MLG black ops player from Team Leverage who's team has won two events this year has had said the game is awful to due lack of symetry in the maps and how it's too often just head glitch vs head glitch, chokepoint vs chokepoint.  Also many maps are circular, many times you will spawn and die, rather than the old maps that had two distinct sides.

That being said it is still a lot of fun and much more challenging, but I gave it 3 stars for this game would have been brilliant if there were more open maps like scrapyard and less  ""mazey"" campfests like hardhat. 3 stars might be harsh but I hold Cod to a high standard, especially after Robert Bowling of Infinity Ward said the maps were going to be designed for run and gun and not camping, and the exact opposite seems to be the case. There are many pros to this game that should be mentioned.  Amazing graphics and sound, and it still has much faster game play than BF3.  The guns are awesome and seeing subtle things like how awesome the new sam turrets are etc are worth the price.  All in all although this game gets very frustrating due to the maps it's still worth it, just forget about your K/d ratio for everyone I know is struggling a bit (wish they would let you keep K/d private, I think It would add a lot to the fun factor, that's another problem with the game) it is still lots of fun. I have not played the sp yet, but I and many others see the MP as the heart of the game. Edit: back to a two star after playing for 10 hours more, the maps are really bad except for about 5 or so..........camp city!",Campy chokepoint maps

B00005BW7L,2.0,"Auto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace. The thing that matters the most in a videogame is the core gameplay, length, and replay value, and auto modelista falls flat on its face in all three categories.
First of all the core gameplay. The game has very short, unmemorable tracks, which is really a shame because the graphics are excellent. The cars drive terribly, powerslide around every turn. As for the car selection, the game consists mostly of uninspired import cars, and the occasional viper or corvette.
As for the length of this game, it took me roughly 3 hours to beat, which is laughable compared to the 35 hours i have on final fantasy 10, and im still nto even close to done! The longest race is 4 or 5 laps long across a tin race course, really the load times took more than the race time most of the time.
As for the replay value, once you beat the game, your done, might as well use this game for kindling in your fire place. Yes, it does feature online game play, but  it is terribly uninspired, and just as boring and brief as the offline expierience.
So what is the one saving grace of this game? The pretty graphics of course! Through all of the flaws the light of graphics does gleam through on this not so shiny gem. Customizing your car is extremely entertaining, and finding all the perfect tones of paint for your car. There is also a wide array of stickers, and a custom sticker maker. The down side of the sticker maker is that it is no where near user friendly, and a tutorial would have been VERY helpful.
In conclusion your money is much better spent elsewhere. This is the kind of title that comes out terrible, then the sequel unexpectedly blows you away, so lets just keep our fingers crossed that if there is an aut modelista 2, they completely overhaul the terrible controls and make the races MUCH longer!",depressingly lackluster!

B0009JB3J4,2.0,"This game is the perfect example of how to go from critically aclaimed playability (i.e. Spider-Man: The Movie games) to button-smashing redundancy.

There are less than 10 moves in this entire game for both Venom and Spider-Man.  Here's the list:

Spider-Man:

1) Web 360 degree attack

2) Web yank attack (kick or punch)

3) Web yank under and punch attack

4) Web hang (on street lamp)

5) Web stomp attack

6) Web attack.

Venom:

1) Tentacle attack

2) Back breaker

3) Tentacle grap and throw

4) Tentacle grap and smash face into ground

5) Tentacle grapple (This only works on objects.  It's basically a zip line.)

6) Tentacle grab and life drain

As you can see, these are extemely basic moves that quickly grow boring within the first few minutes of the game.

Boss fights are more of the same (in no particular order):

The Rhino: Just jump on his back and punch or kick.  When he gets mad, run.  Repeat.

Silver Sable: Jump and kick or punch.  Dodge.  Repeat.

Wolverine and Beetle:  Whip, whip, whip, run, dodge, throw object, whip, whip, ad nauseum.

Redundant nonsense.  Also, the game suffers from an invisible wall during boss battles.  Example: During my fight with the Green Goblin, as I tried to dodge his fireballs, I kept running into an invisible wall, making it impossible for me to dodge his attacks.  Unbelievably cheesy!

Another strike against this game is that now you're forced to finish irrelevant repetitive side games in order to move the story ahead, beacause everyone actually ""loved"" those racing courses the last time around.  The combat tour, also a side quest, are the most unfair battles ever.

How it works is that you seek out criminals in the city and, when you find them, there's about 5 or 6 of them just standing around waiting for you.  In every case, the most cheesiest of all the thugs (usually a guy with a flame-thrower or fire bombs) will do nothing but block your attacks and shoot at you, while you're trying to take down everyone else.  The problem with this is that you're forced to keep jumping and punching and kicking.  There's absolutely no style, joy, or beauty to the whole ordeal.  You'll find yourself constantly trying to find room to fight rather than taking these thugs out like the hero you're supposed to be.

Speaking of dodging, I use that term very lightly.  Remember that cool dodge feature in Spider-Man: the Movie 2?  Well, it's gone.  The only dodging you'll be doing is simply jumping out of the way.  Lame, lame, lame!

I finished the game in 2 days and I tell you it's as worthless as Dragonball Z: Sagas.  Rent it, if you must.",Button-Smashing Boredom!

Want a really awesome game to play on your ps3? Buy The Last Of Us or any Naugthy Dog games.

B00XWQZPQ8,2.0,"So it took me a bit to decide between 2 or 3 stars, I went with two and here's a short review of why.

Pros -
Graphics are solid
Storyline is fun although does get corny at times
Customization is better then most games now and days but still very limited on certain cars.
Map Size is pretty good

Cons -
Biggest one is by far the physics, every car severally under steers no matter what.
Heavy rubber banding which makes races annoying and takes all the fun and turns it into frustration for the last few races.
Requires online connection, doesn't really bother me but does suck not being able to pause and the first few days were unstable.
The steering assists (assists to make up for driving with a controller) in this game are way too noticeable. You can go into a corner holding to the right and your front wheels will either bug out or go left on there own. This makes the game make bad choices such as thinking you're still drifting when you're trying to straighten out. This combined with the physics makes every corner completely random, in a bad way.
The sound design is decent but I'd prefer if it was better.
Playing online with friends is a huge pain and very complicated.
Weather and Daytime is determined based on where you're at and even then the game is either early dawn or night time, and either raining or wet.
No option to change buttons.
No wheel support
No cockpit
No Manual (which is sad coming from a game based on ""car culture""
Pretty simple car list, nothing out of the ordinary.
Very little damage modeling.
Collectibles seem to mean nothing (haven't collected them all but I have yet to get anything from them, and there's no achievements for them)
Cops are way, way to easy to escape.
Cops are a bit too rare to find.
No ""matchmaking""

I could probably come up with some more cons but you get the idea. This game is worth $20, maybe $30 depending on personal preference. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and get Forza Horizon 2, game's actually cheaper by now and is still one of the best racing games in recent years.",Die hard racing fan's honest opinion
B00SVL8IWW,2.0,"Basically, I simply hate the controls in this game. It's like trying to control a drunken robot while playing with a drunken method. It's not for me but there is considerable charm here. Just don't give into the mindless hype about this game.",Poor controls.
B00EFRN2IQ,2.0,"Let me start out by saying I have most of the Sims 2 and Sims 3 additions and I have about 200 hours into Sims 4. I wanted to wait to really try everything out before I created my review on the game. I didn't get the game until it had been out for several days due to slow mail service so I had time to read some of the early reviews which weren't very good. After playing the game I'm not sure if it was rush to be the first one with a review or if they deliberately wanted to give bad reviews but after playing almost 200 hours I have found many of the things that people say don't exist do exist in the game. The game starts with the 2 disc set and the game does use those to install the game and there is some download needed from the internet to completely install the game and it took a couple of hours to completely install. After the game loaded on Origin it took note of the fact that I have several Sims 3 add-ons and added additional download content to Sims 4 for me because I had them. Great fan loyalty bonus idea I wasn't expecting that.  One of the first thing I noticed is how small the town is now you have 3 neighborhoods with houses each with about 5 or 6 houses and an empty lot, a park neighborhood  and a business neighbor hood with 3 or 4 businesses. The lots themselves are very small and you can't change the size but you can change the type of building so you end up having to build up rather than out if you need additional space. This does make it hard to garden unless you put it in the community garden spots that each neighborhood has the small telescopes and microscopes are gone and have now become buildings that again gobble up acreage on your lot. If you go to another town or another neighborhood or to a neighbor you do get a load screen instead of traveling but if you travel to areas in your own neighborhood say community garden or park you can walk. The load is very quick and I am running several mods and it did slow a little bit the more mods I added and the further I got in the game but it's much faster than Sims 3. Now for the things I liked the building is a lot easier with some pre-made rooms with ability to stretch or shrink those rooms. Also something new is the ability to have multiple aspirations so instead of just one aspiration like before you pick the main aspiration you pick at start or one of the ones you get as you play the game so you earn more perk points to buy abilities faster. With ability to travel to any new town or neighborhood simply by clicking on it makes it fairly easy to go to multiple locations so I don't really miss driving. Sims 4 also gives the ability to play multiple families simply going to manage world and selecting the family you want to play without losing anything from your primary family. You do need to manage the other families since they really don't do anything other than age they don't have children on their own unless you interact with them and some do have jobs and you will see them as bartenders and other jobs around the town. So after a certain amount of time if you don't refresh the other Sims they start to die out or your town will look like a retirement village with all of the old people. So after playing this long I would rate it just as good as Sims 3.
*********************** Update ******************************************
After my initial review and the further I got in the more the game became unstable. While saving the game just stopped working and crashed, ok no big problem I thought I saved the game a couple hours earlier so I restarted the game and I get: ""The save game you are attempting to load was saved with a newer version"" and I was unable to load any of my older saves. After several hours looking online I discovered the fix:

1. Copy your save folder to your desktop
2. Delete all the save games in your original save folder
3. Start a new game with a new sim and move them into a new house other then the one you're playing in.
4. save and exit your game.
5. go to your backup save folder move your last good save game something like Slot_00000001.save.ver4
6. paste the game into the original save folder but edit to the next slot which is usually Slot_00000003.save and remove the version number at the end.
7. Restart the game and load the new game you just restored.

This worked for me but now the game crashes after every couple of saves and I have to redo this process again. With that in mind I would wait several months in hopes that they fix this problem so I can recommend the game at this time.",Continued crashes the further you get in
B015WCV6QM,2.0,"I've been a dedicated Razer fanboy for many years since they started releasing left-handed ergonomic mice. This is my fourth Razer mouse, and unfortunately will be my last for now.
While it was working, it was so-so. It feels smaller than the old Diamondbacks, and strangely flat. Someone like me with larger hands would not enjoy using it for extended periods. The appearance is on par with what I expect from Razer, and the responsive cursor is good as well.
I've ranted before about how bad Synapse 2.0 is, and it has not improved since then. It still requires you to have an account and store your settings online just to configure the mouse, and the program still messes up your system settings and crashes on a regular basis. New with this mouse, if you replug it into a different USB port than when you first installed the software, the LED lighting will quit working completely and revert to default settings. Ugh.
Now the worst news. I had two of these mice. The first one died completely less than 24 hours after unboxing. The replacement one lasted for probably a month before the scroll wheel started missing, double-scrolling, scrolling the wrong way, etc. Before now I have never had reliability problems with Razer. My first Razer mouse - a left handed Deathadder 3500- still works despite having been carried all over campus for years and dropped several times. I was not impressed.
I now have a Roccat Kova. For 1/3 as much money, I've got a larger profile, more buttons, software that works, and have not had any issues. I am probably not going back to Razer until they release better software.","Fourth razer mouse, and last"
B00DB9JYFY,2.0,"I got the game for free because I bought the Xbox One Titanfall bundle.  I figured I might as well get the bundle to receive the game for free.  I must say, I'm glad I went that route instead of spending $60 on it.

I can't really think of a redeeming aspect other than it's good for some mindless action gaming when in the mood for it.  And, when in the mood for that, it gets the job done.  That's why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.  Now, for the reasons I don't think much of this game.

The graphics aren't impressive.  If I walked into a room and saw someone playing this, I wouldn't know if I'm looking at a Xbox 360 or Xbox One game.  Before anyone tries to claim it's because my TV is not good, I'm playing on a 52-inch Samsung 1080p LCD.  My TV is not the problem.  The game's environment is muddy for the most part, there is a lot of brown everywhere you go.  I also don't see any environmental destruction.  If you shoot a wall with a titan's cannon gun, the wall is still standing after the smoke clears.  Enemies can hide behind a barrel the entire time, no matter how many missile shots it takes.  The story is worthless, I don't care about it or any of the characters in the game.  It's as if Respawn tried to create something meaningful, but what they delivered is not interesting at all.  Two factions are fighting over energy on different planets with no characters to base the story around, at least that's what I think is happening.  I understand I'm a grunt, but shouldn't there be somebody leading this story to its conclusion?  Each match basically boils down to running around and killing as many opponents as I can or capturing an enemy's flag.  I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm doing it nonetheless.  ""Campaign"" mode is not a traditional campaign mode.  It's online multiplayer with the previously mentioned attempt at a story.  It is one online match after another, there is nothing to develop a story aside from banter by a couple of digital faces that appear on your screen via the HUD as they try to convey drama and a sense of desperation that simply is not there.

Speaking of online multiplayer, it's 6 vs. 6 at all times.  Why are there so few players on a next-gen console?  Instead of providing more human opponents, the game fills the maps with mindless bots who can be dropkicked (literally) to death as they stare at you with their guns pointed at you for 5 seconds.  Fighting these bots reminds me of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where Sir Lancelot approaches the castle on a loop for about 30 seconds as the guards watch him the entire time.  They then seem surprised when he reaches them and stabs one with his sword, just like these bots are unsuspecting of your run toward them with your lethal dropkick prepared to impale them to their digital deaths.  The humans who are in the maps are mostly running around like chickens without heads spraying and praying until their 24-foot tall robot is available for occupation.  Once in the robots, the humans continue their spraying and praying tactics without trying to achieve any objectives, such as capturing the enemy's flag or a waypoint.  There is no organization as a team in this game, just people sprinting and floating with jetpacks in an attempt to get as many kills as possible so they can see a high number next to their name after the match is complete.  If you play with friends who are dedicated to playing the modes the way they're intended to be played, I'm sure the experience is slightly better.  But, if you're playing with strangers, it's an all-out mess of a rush with no direction.

The audio is decent, nothing spectacular is happening.  The sounds of gunfire are heavy and the footsteps of the titans are satisfying.  But, the audio isn't of a quality I haven't heard before.

In the end, this is just another frantic FPS with no real reason to play for an extended period of time other than trying to level up.  But, after leveling up, then what?  The weapons are not plentiful as in other FPS games, so the variety is pretty limited.  When playing Titanfall, I feel like I've already played the game a hundred times before, but with different titles.  Nothing about it says ""next-gen"" to me, nothing.  I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty on the 360, but with robots thrown into the mix and stupid bot enemies/teammates to make the experience even worse.  By the way, the novelty of robots wears quickly, especially after you see how fast they're destroyed by opponents.  A titan falls from the sky, gets a few rounds off, and then explodes seconds later because an entire team's attacking focus is on that titan.  Players wait 2 minutes for 15 seconds of robot action.

This game is not the recipe for excitement, longevity, next-gen gaming, or fun.  It is my opinion that this game was very much overhyped and not worthy of some of the high praise we have all seen.  I would not recommend it to a friend.

B000083JXT,2.0,"I remember years back being on the official Lords3 BBS, and being one of MANY to warn the developers NOT to make this into an RTS game.  In fact, I begged, pleaded, cajoled, coaxed, WARNED the devs that turning Lords-3 into something it wasn't meant to be would be a huge mistake.

Then I recanted.  I thought, well, maybe something neat and new'll come out of this effort.

Nope.

My first gut instincts were right, and so were everyone elses' who at first asked, and then demanded that Lords-3 be kept a turn based game.  But, as luck would have it, the marketers won out.  And the Development team were required to crank out a piece of crap real time strategy game.  That, and the music stank.  I mean it sucked big time.

The only redeeming factor was that the battlefield graphics were okay.  That is until the armies actually fought one another, and then you saw a cascade of of swords and clumps of computer generated soldiers fighting over the same two-square feet of game territory.

There was barely any management involved.  No creation of troops.  No empire building.  No nothing that made the first two Lords and Lords of Magic games incredibly fun to play.

It, was, all, GONE!

Man, oh man, oh man.  And to think that I, me, personally, sent off some of my best gaming ideas to the offshoot company that was formed after Impressions Games closed it's door, for a medieval themed ""unofficial"" sequel to Lords of the Realm 2, a little game entitled ""Stronghold"", and THAT game went off to earn MILLIONS.  That, as opposed to Lords-3 and its alleged ""independent"" minded developers who shirked my ideas of tunneling, or hurtling dead animals over a wall via catapult, or allowing hunters to be part of armies.  Pitch, mixing of wall types for castles, etc., ""Stronghold"" had it all.  ""Stronghold"", the battlefield version, was what Lords-3 wanted to be, but the developers didn't know it.

After I passed on my list of ideas to one of the key employees, I figured, well, they'll look it, and throw it in the waste paper basket.  But maybe they'll get a little inspired by one or two.  Well, truly great minds think alike (or I just got lucky in that they happened to choose the same ideas I was thinking of), again, Stronghold triumphs.  Lords-3?  No.

Stronghold spawned an expansion pack.  Three expansion packs, in fact!  Tons of websites with user made maps, and TWO 3D accelerated sequels!  Lords-3?  Again, no.

So, what did I find redeeming about Lords-3?  Well, truly I did like the tactical maps.  I didn't like the music.  I didn't like the game play itself in either the strategic or tactical side of things.  But, I did very much like how the tactical battlefields were rendered.  Those were truly impressive.  But the sum total of the game?  No.

Well, Stronghold thrives.  But the Lords series seems to have permanently laid down lance and shield.  And the whole tragic thing about this is that it didn't need to be so.

I remember the most apparent truth about creativity is that only creative people, artistic people, can contribute to a creative effort.  Not business people.  Business people are borderline sociopathic, if not fully sociopathic.  They have no sense of pleasure, empathy nor right nor wrong.  Where the artist has all these things and more.

The people at Sierra and Activision should've listened to their talent and creative fan base.  But, for whatever reason, they did not.  And those that reaped the fruits of heart felt labor succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.  I was part of that.  I got no money for it.  I got no recognition for it.  But the developers knew me back then, and I was more than glad to contribute.

However, in retrospect, I sure could use the money now.

But, regardless, if you must buy a copy of Lords of the Realm 3, then buy one of the real cheap leftover used copies.  Otherwise don't waste your money.","Awful, horrible, a huge disappointment, but some redeeming factors."
B001CDL6WA,2.0,"I rented this & played it for about 90 min. from BlockBstr. (I'm so glad blockbstr & gamefly exist for renting!)
It has practice elements, 4 of each of: hockey, lacrosse, basketball, soccer, tennis & football. the menu is very bare bones & the loading times are nice & quick. There is multi-player, and there are no scores for even 1P except for during the game. I could not find any high score retention. You can choose a pre-made avatar or edit yours more w/very limited facial & uniform choices.
The instructions are quick pic w/text, which to me didn't always coincide with what ultimately worked which is very bad. if you're looking for simulation, this isn't it by far, it's mostly a button smasher arcade/timing feel. at best, a few use tiny flick motions.
the camera is from 3rd person feel & your character isn't transparent like wii sports so it's hard to see & you feel disconnected from what you are doing. there are stuttering issues as well when there is a lot of movement from the ball or your avatar.
you are not playing full sports, but partial aspects, usually about 4 in each sport, which I love the idea of like wii sports practice, but the developers did very poorly at implementing any fun or the idea of INTERACTIVE movement point of the wii.
Football
you can be quarterback throwing & targeting to cardboard moving players (you point with the IR, hit A to lock on, THEN flick the remote), kicking, errr... I already forget the rest.
Basketball
 you can you run down the court & choose first from pull down menus how you'll run & what type of dunk. in Fast Baskets you can make as many baskets as you can once you click to have a ball thrown to you, err.... I forget the other 2 ""games""
Tennis
has hitting bulls-eyes on the ground, hitting bottles, hitting cards that move & pinball tennis. Pinball was the only thing on here I thought was decent since it's unique, has multi-balls in play sometimes, but the ""board"" is very small & mostly waiting for your turn to hit it back.
Soccer
has kicking to goal past standing obstacles, playing goalie (I couldn't get ONE!) & silly bouncing a ball on your foot & transfers to head & knee (I couldn't figure out how to screw up on purpose it was so boring!)
Hockey
had hitting to goal targets on each corner of the goal & the flick registered a full 2 seconds after I did the movement! NO JOKE!!! Totally broken.

I lost interest in seeing how badly they could programs these games. I only played that long just out of morbid curiosity.
many games it took me a while to understand how to play & there are so many clicks that the idea of motion is a joke.

B000CQIDTC,2.0,"HalfLife 2 Episode One

Here is a transcript of my interview with Valve Software's new Scurity/Public Relations Director, Mr. Knute Case:

Me: Hello Mr. Case, can I call you Knute?

Knute Case: Sure hacker.

Me: What? Why am I a hacker?

Knute: Well, here at Valve, all users are guilty of hacking until proven ""not so guilty""; its our policy.

Me: Oh, that explains ""Steam"". Well let's talk about the new game HalfLife 2 Episode One. When I finally got to play the game, it was great but..

Knute: Wait a minute, you figured out how to install it? YOU ARE A HACKER!

Me: No, I just realized that I had to uninstall all the Steam software that was already running on my PC first-

Knute: Let me guess, you installed Steam where you wanted, not the default location?

Me: Yeah, well it is my PC after all. Anyway, I was able to install Steam, then I re-installed Half-Life 2 then this game-

Knute: But you still had to download the actual game, The DVD just contains just a few pieces of Episode 1. It may be your PC but the game will never really be yours, Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! So Hacker, were you able to download and decrypt the game?

Me: Yes I was eventually but it took a while. I still resent having to log onto a web server to play a single player game, this seems kind of crazy. And what about giving us gamers some clear instructions?

Knute: Next you'll be asking to be treated like a customer. Clear installation instructions would be like giving you hackers free access to the source code. That is why we bury the Episode One executable in a hidden folder deep inside your PC.

Me: Knute, the game also crashed a lot, many graphical glitches.

Knute: That's a new game feature we call ""sucker-vision"", we updated/fixed that feature in Episode Two. Want to guess at how to get this patch now? I can't tell you directly but here is a clue:""jhusyow848eokfjcnciej * 125 / 6""..

Me: I'll pass. Also, the game is awfully short.

Knute: We here at Valve have determined that selling a game in 80 short parts for twenty bucks a piece is better than selling a game in 2 parts for 40 bucks each. But we pass that savings on to the consumer.

Me: Really? How?

Knute: We will be bundling the next chapter of Half-life 2 with a free retina scanner and a DNA sampler. This technology will make the game more secure and fun-fun-fun!

Me: Sounds awful. Is there any way to play this single player game off-line? I just want a few hours of fun minus the aggravation.

Knute: Yes, but that would be telling, Har-Har-Har! Seriously, that will never happen - its Valve's game, not yours...","""Steaming"", Buggy game, almost works.."
B007FTE2VW,2.0,"SimCity had SO much great potential to be everything we all wanted and more. Unfortunately, EA had to decide to give us players absolutely nothing that we wanted and make us ""rent"" their game at the cost of sixty dollars minimum in order to actually use it, rather than own it.

THE PROS:

* Really nice graphics.

* Building add-ons and upgrades.

* The simulation aspects of the city itself are very good.

* The gameplay is easier and more user-friendly.

* The ability to individually follow a Sim or a vehicle, though you won't be able to label them or ""create Sims"" to keep track of.

* Great Works, massive city-sized projects, being a new introduction into the series, gives you something major to work towards.

THE CONS:

* Always have to play online. Perhaps the BIGGEST flaw of all. You CANNOT PLAY WITHOUT A REALLY HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. It is REQUIRED! If you have a slow internet connection, you're screwed. If you don't have home internet access, you're screwed. You have to log into Origin, and then play the game off of EA's servers. As you may or may not be well aware of now, the EA servers are atrociously bad. And what will happen ten years from now if anyone wanted to play this game? I still play Sim City 4 and that was released ten years ago.

* Server issues, of course. They suck and their terrible-ness isn't going away anytime soon. This is a separate issue by EA, unrelated to the Always Online issue. During the first two weeks, most players couldn't even get INTO the servers. These problems will likely be fixed over time, but the Always Online requirement likely won't ever away.

* Can't save your own city (its auto-save) and can't reload anything. You cannot test or experiment anything in your city to see how it works, because of this. Also, because of the server issues, you very well could lose everything due to the auto save feature. Or, if you can't get back onto your local server and have to use another one.

* Limited city size. Most people's OTHER glaring, giant flaw in the overall game. This really should be called ""SimTown (2013)"". The size is only about a 2 square kilometer area. Or 400 square city blocks, at its maximum peak. This is much smaller than it sounds, and a full entire city can be made in about an hour. You'll get about another hour or two out of it upgrading and trying to maximize everything to peak efficiency, so... up to three hours, on average, is what you're looking at for a fully complete city, here.

* You cannot, for the most part, build a fully functioning city, by yourself. While with some, it is possible, the game is really set up so that you more-or-less have to trade resources with other cities in order to properly function. This was their vision when they made the game. They wanted it to be an interactive social experience. Otherwise, the multiplayer would merely optional for those who want it, not so heavily encouraged to the point where they try to force you to use it in order to get a fully functional city. As for trading resources... you can either do this with other players online if your region is publicly open, or if you're like me, you'll prefer a private region that only you control. However, if you do a private one, you'll constantly be hopping between cities once you hit a peak or barrier for resources. If you do an open region, you'll have to rely on strangers to help you build your city and assuming the server DOESN'T shut down on them, they lose their cities, they don't troll, or they don't just forever abandon their city that your town is forced to rely on, they still more than likely will mess you up more than help you. Problems in other cities affect yours, and how many people would really care or be considerate enough to not cause problems to your own city, especially in cases where it won't affect theirs?

To put it in other words, Forced Multiplayer and cooperation kills any single-player fun to be had. Unless you play with personal friends and they all think like you do and you can all work towards a common goal, this will surely be more of a hindrance than if you could just play fully alone. This is beyond forced and unnecessary. You can build a great city entirely on your own, but you have to be an true expert player in order to do so. Its very hard.

* Speaking of which... Specialized cities are more-or-less mandatory instead of merely optional. Because every city on the region needs to support each other, SOMEone's going to have to build an industrial city. And someone's going to have to be a mining city, garbage city, cheap commercial city, etc. Sucks all the fun and imagination out of it all, just like modern-day Lego kits.

* Also... the interface is pretty much the same way. Much more user-friendly and simple, but offers FAR less creativity, as well. Every single possible thing in the city has to be linked by roads. Can't build a park or anything out in the middle of nowhere. Can't build a cabin up in the woods. Can't build a mountain retreat to have an isolated Mayor's Mansion at. And so on. Also, the zoning for neighborhoods also offers less freedom. You have to zone by road size, now. The ONLY upside to this is that roads also now take care of any power and water requirements, so having to build power lines and pipes are no longer necessary. Though some people won't like this newly added shortcut (I am one of them) because pipelines weren't that big of a major hindrance in past games, to begin with. The road system causes more problems than solutions, especially in a designated space smaller than most major city's downtown districts.

* No terraforming or creating your own custom regions. It is absolutely impossible to affect the natural resources of the land, like creating rivers, digging lakes, or forming mountains. Oh, and the pre-made choices aren't really that great, either. This also leads to monotomy and the same boring terrains every time.

* No option to skip tutorials. They are long, boring, lame, and there every time you start a new region/city. Apparently, you can exit out of the city to avoid having to fully go through them, though.

* Many things missing from previous SimCity installments, like subways or well, ANYthing underground. These will likely be sold as exorbitantly high DLC's.

* The Sims are glitched/flawed. The way the Sim Agents work is: A sim will go from a house and work a job. Then, go home at the end of the day. Only problem is, no sim ""owns"" their own home, and they just go to empty houses/jobs by proximity and occupancy, so they really don't ""own"" individual jobs, either. This will result in whatever businesses that are furthest away from your residental Sims to fail, because the Sims will never travel that far until all the other occupancies/jobs are filled up, first. So, you could have several over-crowded businesses near your residental homes, and several abandonded/empty jobs further away from your houses that they fail to reach because they're 'too far away.' This is also why traffic jams occur frequently despite how man bus stops you put down and why businesses seemingly fail for 'no reason.' In order for it to work functionally, you'll have to plan to put your top businesses or factories near the entrance of the city and your residental areas somewhere in the middle of town, or close to one designated spot where jobs are. Spread anything out or place jobs in different parts of the city besides one spot, and chaos will ensue.

Overall, this SimCity game could've been SO close to perfect had EA not deliberately chose to ruin it with their horrible and likely greed-inspired choices. Merely not forcing players to have to always be online with a high-speed internet connection, not forcing them to have to rely on their laggy and buggy servers, not forcing multiplayer on one of the only truly Single-Player Gaming franchises out there, and NOT giving us such small city-size limitations could've and probably would've made this game a perfect SimCity/city managing simulator (even with minor bugs, aside).

But as it is in reality right now, it is a forced Massive Multiplayer Online experience (not even true multiplayer, but rather a 'multiple single-player community') that has you building tiny two-by-two square kilometer towns where resources are always limited and there's always a very good chance you'll lose your entire city and everything in it.

Again, allowing us the FREEDOM to play this game by ourselves, offline, with actual city-building space would've likely made this game near perfection. But as it stands now (especially at sixty dollars), it is not worth your time, money, or attention.

Remember Mass Effect 3's ending (if you've ever played that before)? What is it with EA and upsetting their fans every March? It doesn't take a genius to figure out all they need to do. Its mind-numbingly simple; so dumb, anyone can figure it out. Give the fans what they want and they'll give you their money! Win/Win. THQ - an extremely horrible gaming company that cut corners and ripped customers off in the most extreme ways - learned this lesson the hard way. They are now bankrupt and deservedly so. EA has screwed up time and time again in the past, and their customs of restricting players' freedom and greedily high-pricing them and ripping them off with DLC/expansion packs will not go unpunished. Fans can be very vocal about this and I know most companies likely won't care about fan complaints, especially over the internet. However, when customers speak with their wallets, shareholders and investors also become very unhappy and companies fail and die off. You simply CANNOT be successful while cutting corners, taking away freedoms, and upsetting all your loyal customers. Game companies aren't like McDonalds or Comcast cable.

Again: It's simple! Give us what we want and we'll give you all our money! Up until their ending, Mass Effect, developed by BioWare and published by EA, got this 100% right. But then, they didn't and boy, did that hurt them. But it seems EA refuses to learn from their mistakes. Funny thing is, EA's quality isn't even as bad as THQ's was. THQ made terrible games, and made terrible game decisions on purpose, AND ripped off their customers with pure greed as their intentions. EA at least, has quality games, yet they still manage to p! ss off their fanbase just as badly.

As we stand, we have a SimCity game that was developed wonderfully by Maxis and ruined, at least in part, by EA and their ""Always Online"", ""Always co-dependent on other players"" bone-headed executive mistakes to maximize profits and minimize quality or player freedom. By the way, the game could've been fully functional offline, and one of the main reasons they did this is to prevent ""piracy,"" which is ALWAYS a greed-based decision. (5% of players pirate the game, so 95% have to suffer for it?)

SimCity is a game that could've been, but never was. And its painful to see what a fun game this could've been, but ended up turning into, due to technical crap. Because of the possibilities for a great game, I can't in all honesty, give this 1 out of 5 Stars. And the game WOULD'VE been awesome, had it not been so restrictive and buggy. But it is, and they ruin any possibilities for the true great gaming experience this could've been. While there may always be hope for the future, such as a console-ported version that addresses and fixes all of the current mistakes of this release, as it stands now, SimCity 2013 is not worth your time, not worth your hard-earned money, and not worth your attention, at all. It pains me to have to say this, but when companies mess up this big and royally, they have to be held accountable. Someone deserves to get fired immediately over this. SimCity is THAT bad.

B00149ILCK,2.0,"I really wanted to like this game but there are a number of things that has made me really dislike it.  Number one is the crummy save system.  Instead of saving the game where you left off before you died the game either sends you back to a HQ where you tediously have to reload your guns and ammo or it starts at a checkpoint where you have to go through all the things you did before.  The sneak doesn't work because the too numerous Nazis can apparently see everything and through walls and behind trees so it is an almost useless skill.  if you expect to win a shoot out, forget it for once the silly Nazi blows his magic whistle the Nazi spawn out of the ground faster than Darkspawn and you will never kill them all as they spawn right in front of you and behind.  Sean is a weak character who dies easily when the Nazi spawns pop out of the ground and see through the trees.  You do a lot of tedious running for your life in this game looking for safe places to hide only to find that most of the time when you get there you can't get in because the all-seeing, all knowing Nazis saw you from a hundred yards away.  If there were this many Nazis in France in the 1940's all seeing and all knowing, they would have won the war.  What could have been a great game is just ruined because of the silliness of spawning Nazis with magic whistles.

B00178630A,2.0,"I had fun playing Diablo 3 for awhile but there's little reason to replay it again. The first play-through was alright until you realize how repetitive it was. There's also a problem with the difficulty scaling I think. On the first play-through the game was almost too easy and then on the next difficulty the game is way too hard. I think part of that has to do with how terrible the loot is. 95% of the loot you find is worse than the same equipment you found ages ago and 99% of the loot is for a different class then you're playing. I beat Diablo 3 Inferno difficulty and the loot I got after the Diablo boss fight was a joke. I think there was one item for my current class and it's stats were way under what I already had from the beginning of the game.

B00001ZWNA,2.0,"In Rainbow Six, you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos, plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasion.
The critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team, equiping them properly and then planning out the raid.  This is not Syphon Filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away.  You can be killed in a single shot.  Once the action begins, you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy, otherwise the sophisticated computer AI will guide them according to your plans.
I agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first.  It is very detailed and realistic.  If you don't want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions, then you wont't appreciate the game's considerable depth.
I find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller.  There are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse.  I also found that the action part of the game (moving the aiming cursor) was overly sensitive and very frustrating to use.

However, the game itself falls into the trap that Halo falls into (It's not fun to have to pump 500 rounds into a robot to kill it). I would rather have numerous bad guys to kill coming at me from different locations; that is much more difficult and fun. The color schemes between my team and the enemy in campaign mode are so similar that I'm always second guessing who I'm supposed to shoot. My harshest criticism is the lack of fun and variation in shooting most of the guns. There will be about 4 or 5 different guns on a level and none of the machine guns have any significant difference between each other. COD 2 had so many different options with the guns that made the game so incredibly fun to play. But even though this is set in the future it seems technology could only come up with a couple of cool future guns, but those run out of ammo fast.

B00005ML10,2.0,"Metal Gear Solid 2 is the most dissapointing, melodramatic, unexciting game I've bought in the last few years.  After seeing videos from E3 two years ago, I was anticipating this game like none other, and bought a Playstation 2 when it was released.
There are some real problems with this game.  First of all, it tries to be something that it's not.  I shaked my head in disgust during the opening sequence, as the developer's names appeared like out of a movie, even pretentiously displaying the cliche of ""any resemeblance to real life is entirely coincidental"".
Hideo Kojima, the ""director"" of Metal Gear Solid 2 is so high on himself, he goes so far as to refer to it as a ""Hideo Kojima game"".  After viewing this initial display of fake Hollywood gloss, I was presented with the actual game, which is tedious and ridiculous.
I'm not the first one to complain about it, but for only two hours, you play as Snake.  The beginning of the game is intriguing, bringing back memories of the PS1 classic; the action and stealth are top notch, the suspense kept high with some riveting encounters and the fantastic new graphics.  Once you finish with Snake, the game becomes a train wreck.  The rest of the game you play as a different character, Raiden, who is a sniveling, petulant, cowardly ""hero"".
The story is an absolute disaster, and since the game's focus is more on that than actual gameplay, the overall value is spoiled.  It involves tenuous diaglogue and double crosses, with endless cutscenes spliced between playing.  The actual gameplay is monotonous; it consists of Raiden running around ""The Big Shell"", peforming mundane tasks such as diffusing C4 and searching for THE PRESIDENT.  Originality in it's finest.
The developers saw how successful they were with the original Metal Gear Solid and suddenly thought they were movie directors.  Initially, Metal Gear Solid 2 looked like it was going to be an action packed, exciting game.  Instead, it's a pretentious diversion, as it spirals downward after the first 2 hours, flooded with endless dialogue and boring action, wanting to be more like a movie that an interactive gaming experience.","Boring, pretentious and way overrated"

Instead you have maybe 2-3 stores (often right together) to check out and then have to walk and bike to other destination to ""explore"" which isn't that interesting either.

B000ZKA0J6,2.0,"Allow me to preface my brief review by saying I don't care about LAN; I also didn't particularly care about the campaign being split into 3 boxes, after being told that each campaign would be long. So my negative opinion of the game came after buying it, and completing the campaign, with no predisposed hostility.

Disappointment 1) The campaign was short, uninspired, and uninteresting. I guess I won't spoil anything, but it did not feel, to me, like a complete story (a la... Starcraft, Warcraft 1-3). So although I didn't care before about it only being the Terran campaign, I now do.

Disappointment 2) The battlenet system is just awful. The only people I know who love Blizzard RTS games are crazy for custom maps... RPG's, melee maps with custom units, etc... This new system disallows you from simply making/downloading a map and playing it (not to mention you pretty much can't make maps either, unless you have a master's in computer science). I won't go into the details, but suffice it to say you are stuck with a handful of boring maps on battlenet or the maps Blizzard included... and it didn't include many.

Disappointment 3) I loved Starcraft and Warcraft 2's editors. Then Warcraft 3 came and just tore those to shreds, with its ease of use and total customization power. I was expecting the next level with Starcraft 2; what I got was pretty much a gigantic excel spreadsheet full of jibberish I don't understand. Gone are the days when one could pop open the editor and add some new units or heroes to a map. Now, if doing that is still possible, you pretty much need to go to Starcraft U, and then spend several hours doing tedious crap that will get you possibly the same result as 2-5 minutes in the WC3 editor. This single issue would have led me to not buy the game, as this is my primary interest in Blizzard RTS games.

Disappointment 4) Campaigns and custom maps aside, the game is just a complete rehash of the original with less (and less fun) units. Almost as if they held back units for future releases, which is a total cop out. Firebats, medics, wraiths, and more all appeared in the campaign, so I got complacent... only to find the actual game was completely stripped down. At this point I thought ""Hmm... oh well, I guess I can just put those units back in custom maps""... oya... I can't... see disappointment 3.

So I'm pretty much disappointed about every single aspect of this long awaited game lol. I actually stopped playing it after only 4 days (yes, I completed the campaign, challenges, and played a dozen or so matches), and got the urge to start playing WC3 again (a far better, and more complete game).

I am really hoping the editor and battlenet things are addressed sometime soon, so I haven't completely given up hope; but this game does not measure up to any game Blizzard has produced in the past 16 years.",Unpleasantly Surprised
B00EEMLLI0,2.0,"Very constructed play and very little variation in play is allowed.  It is a follow this path and only this path style of play that is boring and dated.

B0009Z3IWS,2.0,"I don't know how all these satisfied reviewers didn't notice the glaring technical glitches in Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood on the Xbox. The game has so many problems that I've given up on it and will try and complete the game on PC.

I should start by saying that I loved Road to Hill 30. I found it to be a very competent game that ran surprisingly well on the old Xbox. But in this sequel Gearbox ratcheted up the difficulty and exposed many flaws in the gameplay balance. They also botched the programming for the system, resulting in horribly lagging sound and video that corrupts the gameplay.

Specifically, certain enemy weapons like MG nests and the German anti-tank artillery have been given improved range and accuracy. But the range and intelligence of the player's comrades has not improved. This results in a lot more foolish deaths due to AI mistakes than in the first game. And friendly armor is now totally worthless. Your tank commander cannot locate enemy gun emplacements before the enemy artillery zeroes in and begins firing. And sometimes your guy will announce that he's commencing firing while just sitting there and taking it. Cover doesn't work as well either, now that more Germans are armed with panzerschreks. Combine this with the restrictive pathing that too often doesn't allow flanking, and you end up running head first into enemy fire just trying to get lucky and finish the mission.

On the technical side, there are terrible problems with this game that I found insurmountable. Even with all the graphic options turned down, it's unplayable on many of the busier missions. The sound and video lag results in many deaths before you can even see the enemy. And sadly it seems to get worse the further you progress in the story. It hurts my ego to admit, but I just couldn't finish the game. Don't trust my words, read the EiB bug forum on Ubisoft's site. People with all years of Xboxes have problems with this game.

In conclusion, Earned in Blood may have been great on the right platform (PC I hope), but on Xbox it's just a hassle.",Beware of brokenness

B0013HE5UU,2.0,"RUN from this game. It makes Carnival Games look GENIUS in comparison.  As the other reviewer said, you only get 1 free game in each of the 5 sections, so you must play so many times & do well enough in that game alone to earn enough tickets to play the other about 5 games in that section. All the other games cost 10-50 tickets each to play once & they only give you 10-100 tickets each, some only 20 even if you get the top score & play perfectly. Did I mention that in order to get to the next section you must have bought the prizes with said tickets? It's bad enough it looks cheap, dull & the auctioneer in each section have horrible, inane, non-helpful things to say, but also all the games are the same, but in different themes. I got to section two before I was tempted to throw my wii remote. Both had a non-moving objects shooting gallery, both had a whack a mole game, etc. A game that forces you to play games repeatedly ad nasueum to get to anther section. why don't they force you to watch a good movie as well & take any possible fun out of that too? Oh, the ride if you earn enough tickets? Is just another ""game"" such as section 1 is you shot out of a cannon & have to hit the botton displayed at the right time as you go through obstacles. Like a slow rhythm game. OOhhhhhh. You know a game is bad if on the commericial the actors have to dress up & do lame things to seem like they are having fun instead of just showing gameplay.

B01FMQ3LMU,2.0,"It's incredibly ironic this game has 'evolution' in its title as there's little to no evolution here whatsoever. This game is nothing more than a 2016 version of 2002's Dirt To Daytona with updated cars/tracks and slightly updated graphics, that's it, literally everything else is copy/pasted directly from their previous game, Dirt To Daytona, which came out nearly 15 years prior. The physics and audio are 100% recycled, they did absolutely nothing to improve it (the twitchy car is back once again 15 years later). The car audio is comical in how dated and awful it sounds, it's dull, the cars simply don't sound like that anymore. The crash audio, tire screeches, wall contact sounds are all the same and recycled.

And you might say ""that's fine, I liked Dirt To Daytona"" and that's exactly what I thought, but once you sit down and actually play it after dumping $65 on it, you're left with nothing but disappointment and it gets boring really quick as in the end, it plays like a PS2 game and not at all like a PS4 era racing game which is unacceptable. I can't believe they put out such a lazy effort. Twitchy car handling (like you're using a d-pad still), no sense of speed, dull graphics and track detail... it literally does feel like you're back in 2002 when you play it. You can say what you want about the Eutechnyx games, but at least they had pretty decent graphics and good car handling and physics (minus the crash physics). In this game, you can't even hold your line because the car is so twitchy no matter what mode or what tweaking you do which makes it near impossible to race at the restrictor plate tracks without wrecking just trying to hold your line.

Like I said, I loved Dirt To Daytona back in the day, I still feel it's the best console Nascar game ever and I still pop it in from time to time for nostalgia, but that was back in 2002 when the standards for games were much different. Now in 2016, we have much higher standards with games like Forza, Gran Turismo, F1, Project Cars and even DriveClub which are all phenomenal racing games and feel very good and then you have the Nascar games which continue to do nothing but decline. This game doesn't even have group qualifying in it and their DLC plan is a joke. There's no series that needs a bail-out more than Nascar, I expected a lot more out of DMR considering they are essentially Monster Games who released some of the better Nascar games back in the day. I'll give them one more chance, hopefully they'll listen to all these criticisms and improve upon them with the next one, but I lost a lot of my faith in them already with this one and they'd have to release a stellar product after this to get it back. If only Codemasters would step up and snag the Nascar license, they'd be absolutely perfect for the job and they would not screw it up at least to the degree EA Sports, Eutechnyx and now DMR have.

Save your money and pick it up when it's inevitably $20 next month if you absolutely need a new Nascar game or liked Nascar Heat and Dirt To Daytona and would like to play those games again with a new coat of paint. Do not blow any more money on this because it's not worth it, I wish I hadn't.","Copy/pasted effort that is awfully dated, may as well call it Dirt To Daytona 2016"
B00HHUSOLI,2.0,"I purchased these along with a skin for my Xbox 360 controller from Amazon. It was only a few moments after I put the dual shock 4 skin on that I noticed how slippery it was. The controller was so slippery that I had problems holding on to it. I took the skin of and used the controller for a bit, and noticed how much better of a grip that it had without the skin.

Conversely, the Xbox 360 controller skin had a great grip so I left it on.

I don't recommend this product., There are a grip of other skins out there, I wish I knew which ones were not slippery, but I don't. For me, this means I'll buy differently colored controllers instead of trying to use skins.

B003FVMQWQ,2.0,"I've played this game for about a week now and I have to say it seriously sucks.  It is literally a carbon copy of NHL 2k10, only with different sponsors and the addition of the Winter Classic (don't get excited, you can only play as either Philly or Boston) and 'The Road to the Cup' which is basically a party game where you compete in mini challenges.

I had hoped this game would take advantage of MotionPlus but I can't even use it to play because it seems to make things more complicated.  I could never get a shot off, even on a breakaway, no matter how hard I flicked my wrist.  I've heard several people (and read some reviews) that suggest buying a clasic controller and see how you like this game after that.  But what's the point in using a regular controller if you have a Wii?

The commentary is exactly the same as the last version of this game and so are the introductions of the teams, as well as the weird menu layout.

I haven't played Franchise yet and seen what happens when you win the Cup but I assume that will likely be as big a letdown as 2k10 was (NO fanfare at all, all you got to do was skate the cup and take a team picture).

In the games I've played, I've noticed the goalies move more lifelike than in 2k10 but players on the opposing team seem to score from very far out and from awkward angles.

Overall, there is ver, VERY little new about this game which was very disappointing.  Fortunately NHL Slapshot comes out later this month so maybe I won't have to go another full year playing 2k10. On the upside, I now have a chance to chase down some of Gretzky's records on that game in Franchise mode. My advice would be to hold out for Slapshot and pray that EA eventually starts making hockey for Wii because if this is all 2k sports can do, they shouldn't even bother.",No different than NHL 2k10

For shame the amount of pollution that was released into the atmosphere because of this game. How horrible that it will all be in the landfill someday where it belongs.

I rented this Jewel of the Vile for free (thank God) from my little brother's game collection. He handed it to me and said, ""Here...this one isn't...uh...it isn't really my thing.""

""Thing?"" He's only 16 so hasn't really mastered the use of the English language, so I can't blame him for being unable to eloquently describe the putrid nature of this game. Therefore, I will help him voice his opinion.

I was only able to sit and play this for about an hour. I kept waiting for the game to improve...but it never did. What accent is that on the vampire character? I suppose when it came to the voice acting that they couldn't afford a guy that sounded Transylvanian...they had to go for an American guy who -Vas taulkinguh like he vas an eeeevil scienteest goinguh to blow up zee vorld!-. The best part was when he called the idol of greed ""fatty"".

Also...what is wrong with this world's populations' pelvises? Leonardo stood like he was in a permanant state of humping or was beginning to bloat. Do the undead bloat in this world? I kept waiting for him to spike one giant chunk of his hair and say, ""It's time for a little demon cleansing, I MUST SAY!"" (Old Saturday Night Live reference for those of you too young to remember Martin Short's character Ed Grimley.)

I have never played the other Kingdom of Fire games...but (if I've heard correctly) they were more strategy-based. The makers should really have stuck to strategy...because whatever style this is simply sucks.

You run around...trying to find monsters to train your skills...which never happened for me. I got one spell but after that single spell (Heal) it seemed impossible.

B003ZHMMEM,2.0,"I only paid $17 for this, since I used credit from a few trade-ins... and now I'm really glad I didn't pay the full $45-50. I loved the old DKC games on SNES, and seeing how highly reviewed this game is, I assumed it would be a good buy. But I'm disappointed. Here are my impressions after playing a few levels...

The graphics and music are good, very reminiscent of the original game, and for the most part the controls are good. But there are a couple things that are dealbreakers for me:
-In solo mode, you can only control DK (if you get Diddy, he just rides on your back and provides a little extra jumping/hovering ability... boring). I find this really annoying... in all the previous DKC games I would ALWAYS opt for Diddy (or Dixie over Kiddie) because I prefer the light, fast Kongs to the lunky ones. The fact that I'd have to play the entire game as lunky DK is not so appealing. :(
-I don't like the forced motion controls--it seems to interrupt game play in this platformer more than the motion controls in, say, Super Mario Galaxy. It just feels awkward to use, especially with the barrel roll.

Those two things give the controls a ""sluggish"" feel to me, and make it feel a bit like work to get through a level--doesn't really make me want to play it for hours on end like the old games. I'll probably play a little more just to get to a Minecart level, and then sell it back (I think Gamestop is giving $20 for it). It's too bad, I really wanted to like this game. I really should have read more reviews--I probably wouldn't have bought it in the first place if I did!  Lesson learned.

People that never played the original DKC games will probably like it better; without comparing it to anything else, it seems like an okay game, if a little tricky for those unused to 2D platforming.",only DK in solo mode? ugh.

B016KBVBCS,2.0,"Just could not like this controller one bit. I like that they've tried something new, and others seem to really like this, but I could not stand it. I feel if they wanted to go the route of trying to mimic a mouse, they should have used a small rollerball instead. The touchpad area is too large, and trying to use the triggers caused me to swipe the pad in another direction while pulling the trigger button, making me miss what I was aiming for. Very innaccurate, especially for FPS's. At least for me it was.

I grew up with mouse and keyboard games, have grown accustom to console game controllers, and feel pretty fluid with both systems. But this is something completely different. Again, I applaud them for thinking of something different, but if you're on the fence on whether you'll like this or not, I'm going to guess it'll most likely fall on the side of ""or not."" I had my doubts, and they were confirmed.

Another note, seems that I may be in the minority for this opinion, but I thought the controller felt cheaply made. It doesn't feel as sturdy as the PS4 or XBone controllers. The clicking of the touchpads feels cheap. The back battery plate feels cheap. And the just the feel of it just makes me think of a generic controller. That was my initial impressions of holding it right out of the box. But when it's actually connected, it doesn't feel as cheap. The tactile response under the touchpads changes. Swiping them gives a clicking noice/feel, and the buttons sometimes could not be pressed depending on what you were playing. So there are some mechanicals underneath working.

B000MAFXRS,2.0,"I absolutely loved NBA Street 2 on the PS2. 1 and 3 where OK, but 2 was the best. It's almost like EA Sports took the concept of NBA JAM, with all the crazy dunks, no fouls, containing not just the rosters of current NBA teams, but legends as well. The game was almost perfect. Now EA have taken the Street games to the next level of graphics for the PS3. Apparently this is the first game to utilize HD graphics on the PS3. Sure, the graphics are good, there is no complaint there. Nor is it the controls.. the controls are perfect. They have not been modified, other than you only need L1 and R1 to do different kinds of dunks (which I miss the 4 shoulder button combinations) but other than that, the controls work perfectly. The game only glitched on me maybe two or three times, and it was only a small graphic on the shorts that went away in a couple of seconds, and the game only froze on me one time during a loading screen. So I can't say the programming is shoddy.

Every current NBA Team in 2007 is here. For me, the rosters aren't much. I suppose if you like Kobe, Shaq, Lebron James, Nash and Carmello Anthony, then you will love playing as them perhaps... but I'm someone who loves the classic old school players from the past, whom where in the first 3 Street games... yet, there is not one legend in this game at all. That was the first disappointment I came across. I thought perhaps there was a ray of hope when I heard you could download legends as DLC... but they are not legends. They are the fictional characters from the first 3 games. So why are they DLC only? Why should we have to pay for fictional characters that where free in the first 3 games? Why are there no legends of the NBA to play as? That would have at least given this game a lot more interest in continuing to play once the one player challenges are completed.

The game play is the same as the first Street games. 3 on 3 basketball, usually a game to 21 points, but you can also find yourself in games where you just need to lead by 3 points, first to 5, 7, 11, 15 points. It can also be customized. You can also play dunks only, shots only, and gamebreakers only rules. All pretty much the same as the first 3 games. Which is disappointing really, couldn't EA come up with some new modes of play?

What the most disappointing thing about this game is the create a baller has taken a major step backwards. You cannot customize your created player. You can only choose from existing models of players from the game. I'm not even sure that you can even choose from all of them? What on earth where EA thinking? Creating characters has been huge in games for years now, and many games have some awesome creat-a-player options. But this one, you cannot choose anything. You just pick an NBA player that's from the game, and use them as your characters model. You cannot change hair, colors, height, weight, gender (male only) or even something whacky like sticking them in a monkey suit? Why the heck would EA do this? What's even worse, is you can only choose if you are a guard, forward or center, then choose what your main 3 skill levels to level up on will be. But you cannot choose your style, what kind of dunks you will do, nor can you pick any NBA jerseys to where in the game... not even a number. Can you beleive it? You play the whole game without a number on any of your Michael Jordan street jersey's you earn. Not the Bulls jersey, just plain jerseys with the MJ logo on it. Speaking of Jordan, he is my favorite of all time, but EA has really gone over kill with Jordan shoes and attire in this game. The only time you can pick a new jersey to wear, is when you earn one... and apart from the 2 you begin with, they are all Jordan brand shirts. Not only that, all the shoes are Jordan too. Yet, guess what... take a wild guess who is not a playable character in this game? Need I say more!

The game modes are as follows.
Pick Up Game = Exhibition.
Home Court Challenge = The main game. Compete as your created baller, or should I say, model of a current NBA player, and keep on playing a few pick up games, or other modes as mentioned before, to earn enough XP to go into a tournament. The tournaments are always the same. All these do is allow you to unlock and compete on the next court. You play through the season, building up your xp levels, and in the end all you get is a pathetic animation saying you have become a legend of the game...and then.... nothing. You've unlocked all courts, (big deal as there is a cheat to unlock all courts anyway) and your created baller's stats have gone up. whoopdie doo. It only takes a day or two to complete home court challenge, depending on how much time you have on your hands.
Whatever other modes of game play = Who cares
Practice = speaks for itself

The courts themselves are apparently based on actual courts of a few of the NBA stars courts they grew up playing on. Introduced by a boring clip of whom they are the court of, which gets skipped every-time it begins. Personally, I would like to have seen more courts. Proper NBA ones, ones from the original 3 games, and a few custom ideas. The courts in this, well, a couple are ok, but some are hideous. It doesn't help that the vision during game play has a stupid sepia tone over it. Apparently EA did this to make it look like you're watching old school footage of old school games. I'm sure Carmelo Anthony has a few 100 8mm tapes of his old games in his collection at home somewhere. The even bigger joke is there is no old school players to play with.

The music is not much. It's there, but for the most part you don't take notice of it. However it's all jazz and hip hop sounding. Obviously EA couldn't care less about the soundtrack, so why would they care about putting in music that appeals to everyone... instead, just use generic stuff no one will take notice of. However, that may just be my own opinion. If you take a look at the Wikipedia page for this game, it has a brief snippet of the game details and the rest is just the soundtrack listing for this game. That speaks loudly enough on it's own without me having to say anything else about that.

Another thing that has been left out from one of the previous Streets is creating your own courts. You can't even create your own team anymore. It's a real shame because this game has got the potential to make it a classic, but as far as I'm concerned, all it's focus was on details rather than anything that will keep you interested in playing once you have completed things.

The unlockables are a joke. As I said, they are just courts, MJ training jerseys, and MJ shoes. Most of it you unlock just winning during HC Challenge. The rest are easily unlocked by just playing a certain amount of games in various modes. The only other unlokables are a couple of all-star teams. Containing 3 or 4 current to the day NBA stars who I couldn't give two &^%$# about playing as. Funny tho, the WNBA is unlocked right from the start. Yeah, you read that right. There is 4 or 5 females to choose from the WNBA to play as on their team. Buggered if I know who they are, but you can choose them off the bat in exhibition games. Still, can't create a woman tho.

- No NBA legends.
- Create a baller is a joke.
- No create a nothing options.
- Lack of customization to anything but the bball game itself.
- Home court challenge is too easy.
- Not enough modes to play.
- DLC contains fictional characters that should have already been in the game without the need to download them.
- Lack of courts
- Not enough dunks to do with your player (3 dunks without holding a shoulder button/3 holding one or both, and they change when you have a game breaker/plus you can do another 1 and only 1 when using l1 and r1 jumping off a teamates back during a game breaker... oh, and 3 when you don't have a gamebreaker activated and jump off them) that's a total of about 30 dunks a player can do. But which sounds like quite a lot, but by the time you have completed home court challenge, you are bored of the same old dunks, and want to either be able to change them, or wish EA had included the R2 and L2 buttons to do more dunks too. LIKE THEY DID IN THE PREVIOUS 3 GAMES.
- No more rim wrecking, glass shattering, backboard smashing, pull the whole thing down dunks.
- No hook shots.
- holding L1 or R2 and shooting doesnt change the type of jump shot anymore.
- Alley oops need a lot more variations.
- The sepia filter needs an option to turn it off. Am I playing basketball or watching Superman Returns?
- Commentary
- Players soundtrack (what they say on the court) needed more, it's annoying hearing the same old thing all the time.
- Intros are stupid.
- The whole ""get out of the hood"" theme is irritating.
- Kobe Bryant is in it (hehehe)
- No super blocks
- Blocking is way too easy
- The trick moves lack in what you can do
- Needs an option to trade NBA players to other NBA teams
- No jump ball to start, player 1 automatically starts with an inbound pass.
- Could have used some effects on monster dunks like fire, lightning or something not too over the top, but something like they had in the previous games.
- The loading profile screen is a little bugged. Sometimes you have to load your saved data 2 or 3 times before the game asks you if you want auto save on or off. Shouldn't it just save that data and go straight into the select a profile?
- Creating profiles needs to be done before starting the game up. (it should be if you choose to be player two, and it says load profile or choose your own, you would think CREATE might be amongst them!?)

Overall. If you never played NBA Street 1, 2 or 3 on the PS2. And you don't mind the fact you can't play as any legends. Then you might think this game is pretty cool. Having been someone who played the heck out of the first 3, this game here to me is just a version that has stepped up in the graphics, but taken a giant step backwards in everything else. I won't say buy or do not buy, I just hope seeing it the way I see it will help you decide on if you think it will appeal to you or not, and not just give you a quick review of ""I like it/I hate it"" or the ever annoying, ""I bought this for my kids and they love it"". I just hope my review gives you a more in-depth perspective on what to expect and what not to expect. Keep in mind tho, I have never played this game online. However I can't imagine it being all that great from what I have been able to do so far. And beleive me, I found it easy, and not challenging, so I have no beef with the AI or anything. And I do beleive I mastered the controls to what I want, when I wanted. So don't get me wrong and think I was no good at the game or anything... my biggest issue is as I said, the lack of replay value and lack of options that where in in the first 3 games already. To me, this game is one giant step backwards in what should have been a mind blowing game. (even if it doesn't have NBA Legends to play as)","Step up, play the courts, become a legend, then... well... find a new game."
B008U2XH3W,2.0,"I used this controller for maybe a month and a half. I quit using it because the R1 button does not work right. Also the x button is starting to get that way as well. I gave this 2 stars because the controller does feel great while playing and its cheap price compared to Dualshock. But, what good is that when it doesn't work right? My advice is go ahead and spend the extra cash on the Dualshock.",2 Stars
B001HKPUKC,2.0,"That pretty much says it all.  Of course notice my praise is followed by - ""on the Wii.""

Anyway there's Metroid Prime and there's Resident Evil 4 in the (top) two spots in no particular order.  And  Conduit (arguably) comes next.

I probably had more fun with Red Steel, but that was at launch time nearly 3 years ago when the Wii was new and fresh and I was more forgiving of a game's faults.

Certainly Red Steel had a more interesting design and/or was easier to wrap your head around.  But it had more tech problems too.  And if I went back now I might cringe and vomit.

Conduit's aiming controls are better, but next time just give the player your best 3 aiming configs in addition to the configuration encyclopedia you put into the game.  MP3 did this and it was enough for 95% of players.  Surely Conduit can also make this simple addition.

Conduit is a straightforward fps game.  Move around, shoot guys.  Find door openings.  I found it disappointingly sloppy and disorienting.  Frame rate is quite often suspect and the overall look gives a person headaches especially with the various effects in the game.  You'll also find yourself quite often bumping into the door frames as you go through doors.

The multiplayer is fun.  It's always fun to shoot buds online.  And if you notice I said you could arguably put this game behind RE4 and Metroid Prime as the top first person games on the Wii.  Well that would Conduit the top first person online game on the Wii since the other two don't have mp let alone online mp.

But multi-player suffers from frame rate drops and bugs like your screen turning black.  I've played online 5 times or so and I have seen these problems at least 3 times.

Anyway you can get much better fps games on your computer as long as your computer is no more than 3 or 4 years old.  And these games would cost you next to nothing since they are now $10 titles.

But on the Wii you don't have much choice.  And so this game is one of the better picks.  (let's forget Gamecube games for a second.)

Overall though Conduit isn't by no means a AAA game.  Metroid Prime and RE4 are AAA games.  Extremely well-polished and well thought out.

AFter that the quality of the first person titles on the Wii drops off dramatically.  Conduit is arguably the leader of this 2nd-tier pack.",One of the better 1st person games on the Wii
B00004RFBE,2.0,"Looking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool, and from reading all the reviews that say it was good, but when i bought it, it was a very large dissapointment.  After the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating, that you will want to break your computer.  The controls are very messed up, and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything.  This game is frustrating because 90% of the game is trial and error.  If you go the wrong way you become ..., because most of the missions are timed ... so you lose the mission.  I got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing, but it doesn't not make this game worth the ... that it is.

B0012VWQT4,2.0,"When I tried a free downloadable hour for this game, I really thought it was going to be like Cake Mania or Diner Dash but in a hotel setting.  I was looking for something fast-paced and fun, that would keep me entertained for long periods of time.

With Jane's Hotel, however, I found the overall gameplay to be slow and redundant.  Half the time I was waiting for hotel guests to mess something up just so I could fix it.  I think the idea for a hotel is great, I just wish the developers had done a little bit more to enhance the speed and entertainment.",Slow..but maybe I was just expecting too much.
B001UWGCW2,2.0,"In a word: Mediocre.

In a sentence: This game has been compared to the Bioshock, Doom, and many other very well made games series, I find this to be an unfair comparison.

In a paragraph: Going back to the year 1955 seems like this is an all to familiar concept with the likes of Michael J. Fox popping into my head but never the less this is exactly what these game developers having you doing.  The main premise of the plot is to stop the evil Russians from world domination, once again this seems like a plot that has been done and done and done to death.  In a nutshell the story is weak, and I didn't feel compelled to pick up the controller and finish the game at breakneck speed as I did with Bioshock series.  Games like Bioshock are akin to an addictive drug, I am not sure where but at some point when playing a well made game I allow myself to become  eating, sleeping and drinking deprived because I become too engrossed into the story of the game, this never happens with Singularity. Believe me Raven tries very hard to copy critical Bioshock elements, as an example leaving tape recorders with taped messages which are suppose to add to the plot but sadly most of the time they just say the same thing, E99 is bad/good, experimentation on humans is not good/bad, blah blah blah. The tape recorders are placed a lot in the beginning and some at the end, but not consistent and they add very little to the plot.  The other elements that the developers copy badly is the left hand TMD powerglove and the right hand control which is for the gun element.  The problem here is this powerglove looking device never seems to be as powerful at killing the mutated humans as the guns are at least not in the beginning to middle, so I found myself not using it very much.  Also the gun locker idea is a terrible construct; why only allow us to carry 2 guns? Due to this limitation they then force us to choose which two weapons we want, why???  If your going to have the ability to upgrade your weapon then once you find the weapon locker make them a single use item and the same goes for upgrading your TMD powers. On to the graphics Singularity uses the unreal engine which when applied here seemed a bit dated and a bit sluggish, as an example dead bodies twitch and jerk around long after they should. Ok ok I am harping on just the negative as there truly are a few bright spots, they created one big bad boy gun called the Seeker and I must say it is the coolest gun in the game, the gun actually slows time down and you have control over the bullets direction, this was a very fun and unique aspect of the game.  Here again though you get use this gun 3 or 4 times throughout the game and it never becomes a gun that you get to keep in your arsenal, once you run out of ammunition the gun isn't worth carrying anymore. Lastly, the story ends by giving you an ethical dilemma, which is fine but why incorporate this element only at the end? This could have been used several times throughout the game, but instead they decide to use this only once and for me adding it at the end seems like an afterthought.

Some positives:  Seeker weapon was Great! Playing with the time aspect is also Great! Mostly the production value is very good.

Suggestions to the game developers: More Seeker weapon time, a complete rewrite of the story is in order, Don't try so hard to be like another game, be inventive on your own.  Get rid of the weapons lockers and just allow the player to carry all weapons.  Make the TMD powerglove more powerful so that the player thinks of using this equally with the gun aspect.",Bioshock this is not.
B0009S4UOA,2.0,"Considering its a COD game, its main focus is the war aspect of it and what is going on throughout the game as this aspect covers it. Anyway the online multiplayer is okay and is pretty much the main reason why anyone plays a COD game, the on-foot FPS controls are okay and u can't sprint in this game which is stupid. What is also stupid is the fact that the controls for the tank that u control is horrible. Also there really isn't much to this game as well as the fact that the fact that the infinite ammo cheat doesn't work at all. Anyway this game is boring in my opinion and doesn't really interest me. 5/10","The gameplay is ok, but the tank controls suck. This game is mediocre overall."
B00004KHB3,2.0,"Fails. I've never played baldurs gate. I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale. He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows. I stopped about half way through. The most ignorant part about the games is the battles. As you go they get increasingly frequent. I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second. As for fighting, the game lacks as it is more of a point and click.
I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while.
Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change.
The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option ""max hp on level up"" set.
Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive. Sorry but don't get it unless you wanna blow 5 bucks.","A great attempt, but...."
B015TL6PCQ,2.0,"I purchased this bundle through Gamestop when they had a nice trade-in deal (for my old XBOX 360).  I am also a PS4 owner.  In my opinion the PS4 is a 4 star system, XBOX One is a 2.5 star system (rounded to 3).  Here's why:

XBOX One I just spent hours updating and ""installing"" the games that came with the bundle.  PS4 doesn't take more than a few minutes for this.  It seems the XBOX One must run less off the disc or something; it's painful to have to take 10-30 minutes to install each game. (my internet is cable and very fast btw).  For someone with poor internet, they'll likely have to spend an entire afternoon performing updates and installations before they can even use the console.  And as others mentioned, just installing the games that came with the bundle leaves you with ~680 GB free out of 1 TB.  Really?

The overall system interface and online store/etc. are not as intuitive on XBOX One as they are on PS4.  Physically the XBOX One is much larger and heavier than the PS4.

A few minor things about this particular bundle that I knew of, but are still skimpy: no headset whatsoever, Ori game is a download only, Gears/Rare Reply games come in a ""combo case"" instead of separate cases.  EDIT:  Also, if you have an existing headset-- guess what, Microsoft made the XBOX One controller with a proprietary connection!!!  You must buy a $30 ""XBOX One Stereo Headset Adapter"" if you want to use a standard 3.5 MM headset (like my old Turtle Beaches) with this system.  Wow, what a cash grab.

And my number one issue with the XBOX One-- Microsoft's claim of backward compatibility!  Well it turns out that very few titles (100ish) are compatible at this time (mid-December 2015).  According to their web site, more are ""in the works.""  Well, out of my 11 XBOX 360 discs, not a SINGLE game is backward compatible.  This includes games like Call of Duty: MW3 and World at War.  Or even Fable III or the Final Fantasy titles.  None of those are even ""in the works"" yet, and who knows if they ever will be.  Bottom line is this backward compatibility thing seems like a holiday scam in my opinion to get more sales.  Most of the games that are compatible seem like ""ARCADE"" titles or bundle titles sold on the XBOX store.  That includes several from the Rare Replay that came with this bundle.

After that paragraph I decided to round down to a 2 instead of a 2.5.  Overall I think this is merely a fair system.","""Backward Compatibility"" and installation issues drag down the system"

I believe so.  *see ""Batman Begins"" and anything with ""007"" on the case.

The STADIUMS look good, yes.  SOMETIMES the players look cool.  But the camera is awful---so bad that when you're lining up, it goes into an extreme close-up of your quarterback, and then falls to his chest---as if it were hoping to find breasts there.

The gameplay is terrible, sluggish, ridiculous.  The players STILL look like muscle-bound midgets.  No offense to midgets you know but---I'd like it to look somewhat even remotely close to being as cool as NFL 2K5.

The announcing is absolutely horrible, and I'd just gotten to the point where I wanted to kill Madden.  After hearing this s$@# I miss the hell outta' the turducken eating fat bastard.

2:  Graphics.  DS is head and shoulders above Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate (the two games it is most frequently compared to).

B009AOFNU4,2.0,"I've spent a good deal of time with the SSF thanks to a friend who owns one. I even went so far as to order one from Amazon despite it being out of stock with no in stock date listed. I actually ended up being grateful for this as it gave me the opportunity to spend some quality time with the controller and it changed my mind.

Yes, all the glowing reviews are true. It's a joy to use. It's comfortable, light weight, easy to set up and it really is universal. HOWEVER, the library available for iOS and Android games is pathetic. I highly encourage all potential buyers to visit the SteelSeries website and take a look at the lists yourself. If you find a worthwhile selection of games you think you'd enjoy playing with the SSF, then go for it. If you're like most of the rest of us, there simply aren't enough titles on iOS and Android combined to warrant the price tag for this controller. The list may appear long, but quantity does not make up for the total lack of quality titles.

I realize that this controller isn't all about mobile gaming and it does work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. And here comes another BUT.. But, I already have several wireless Xbox 360 controllers which with the help of a $15 wireless receiver ALSO work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. $80 vs $15? Not a tough choice here. The Xbox 360 controller is easily the current favorite of console gamers and most of us already have at least one of them hanging around. Heck, even if you don't have one, $48 to buy a new one including the receiver is still much more affordable.

I really wanted to love the SSF. I really, really did. But until it is more widely supported by mobile game developers, it's just a really expensive portable controller that is unfortunately only a novelty at this point. With Gameloft solely supporting the Duo bluetooth controller, the SSF loses a significant number of the games that I'd even want a controller for in the first place. I'll check back in 6 months or so and see how the library of supported titles grows and if I see even a handful of my favorites there, it would be hard not to buy one. It is also in dire need of a price adjustment. There's no way it can compete when it is nearly twice the price of it's most expensive competitor.","Promising, but has a long road ahead of it..."

B000NJH6YG,2.0,"Early commentators of this game said it was like ""Oblivion on steroids"". Unfortunately, it turned out more like Oblivion on dope. I wanted to like this game. For the record I love Two Worlds II. The bow combat in that game was great. Five star in my book. I've heard other reviewers compare this game to Dark Souls. It's unfair because this game came out in 07 and Dark Souls in 11. I bought a new copy of this game to encourage South Peak to make Two Worlds 3. This first title in the series shows promise. The spell stacking system is in place. This was also well executed in the sequel. Both games suffer because there is no ""lock on feature"" to target enemies. I often swung my sword and cast spells just to the left or right of where my enemy stood. Seriously, this game really looks worse than some PS2 titles. The framerate wasn't as bad once I started playing. Still, the graphics ended up being downright awful. The gameplay was just monotonous button mashing. For RPGs such as this, inventory management is a game of strategy in itself. Knowing what items to buy, sell or store away is half the battle. Yet, the terrible item management in this game managed to ruin most of the fun even in this. I couldn't move similar items next to each other in the inventory. I picked up tons of useless weapons from enemy combatants. I would sell this but soon learned that money doesn't even really matter in this game.

The cut scene graphics and the faces of the characters are awful! I've seen better on PS2! And this was a 2009 release, so no excuse there. The game seems like it was rushed to be put out, probably trying to capitalize on the release of Fast and Furious 4 which also came out in 2009 and marked Vin Diesel's return as a main character to the series. It's another instance of a gaming company caring more about cashing in than producing something of quality. Not that the game isn't fun at times, but the fun is overshadowed by difficult missions to progress a story line that just isn't that entertaining.

FINAL GRADE: C-","Could have, should have, would have..."
B000GHLBUA,2.0,"The main game is decent but relatively short. The big selling point for me were all the multi-player mini-games. I knew that there would be a few throw aways but with 50 choices there had to be something worth playing with friends. Boy was I wrong, all of the games are pretty bad. Many are boring (landing a space ship?), some are limited by graphics (rock, paper, scissors), and nearly all have a truly wretched control scheme (Whack-a-Monkey).

If I hadn't played Wii Sports and Rayman first I would have regretted buying a Wii based on how poorly the Wiimotes function with this piece of software. There have been several times when I swore my Wiimote was broken, only to switch back to Wii Sports and see everything acting perfectly. Overall this is a disappointing launch title that not only doesn't do the Wii's unique control scheme justice it actually makes you think its bad (which it isn't)

B00005V6BB,2.0,"First let me start off by saying I was really upset with EA for the  way they show D-Day.  If you've ever seen Saving Private Ryan, you'll know that the invasion was no walk in the park.  But EA, through some EXTRAODINARY act, managed to show this in an amost whimsical light.  You don't have to sprint madly across the beach, dodging bullets and mortor rounds, stepping over bodies and wounded soldiers.  No.  Instead, you run around on a fenced in stretch of beach maybe 50 yards wide, helping men who are pinned down by gunfire.  Its as simple as running (well, you don't have to run really) over to these men, and firing into the bunkers, causing the Germans to stop firing at you for a couple seconds and long enough for whoever you were helping to continue on his way.  Its incredibly stupid.  Then, when you finally get to the bunkers, you have to clear it by yourself.  For some reason, no one follows you in.  The rest of the game is basically a one-man assault on the entire German army.  You parade around shooting Nazis and getting shot maybe twenty times, then pick up a canteen, which heals you.  ITS SO STUPID!!!  Don't waste any time on this game.  I recommend Brothers in Arms.  Although its not all the way there, its much better than this game.  And, oh yeah, DON'T EVER GET MOH: RISING SUN!!! ITS WORSE THAN THIS GAME!!! (just so you know)",What the hell was EA thinking???
B00JUFSH6U,2.0,"EA Season Ticket Holder Review.

Thats right EA Season Ticket still exists on the older generation consoles. I was lucky enough to get to play this version since Friday night. As for Season Ticket don't but it now, the only other 2 games available are NHL and FIFA and 6 days of early access between the 2 is not worth $25 bucks.

On to the review!

MADDEN BROUGHT YOU BY THE CREATORS OF THE AWARD WINNING NBA LIVE!  oh wait they apologized for that games creation. Hopefully they will do so for this game as well. We are owed an apology.

This years madden will look just like last years (360 version at least). The panels at the home screen are all a little different other than that all the exact same. This year they focused on the area of the game that don't matter at all. For example the training drills from the home screen. For some reason EA thought people buy this game to run random drills. We dont. Waste of resources. Next youll notice they put more time into the Cash Grab that is create a team of course they did every penny counts. Gameplay is the same literally nothing to review that is different.

Career mode!!!!! They made some tweaks here. 1) Training has been simplified to the point you choose who gets training and they get Extra XP each week... If you really want that 60 overall WR to turn into a star you can do that now.  Just allocate your weekly points into that player only and in a season or two hell be a 85! All without ever having to play a game. 2) The second new feature in career mode is the ability to sim to different places in the season. Sim straight to the superbowl, sim to the draft SIM 10 years down the road!! Thats right you can sim 10 years down the road why? I cant tell you but its an option.  The Third new feature doesnt come into play until free agency. Now you get to Bid on players. The new system lets you see exactly where your team stands in the bidding process. Other than that everything is the exact same as last year.

Scouting is still completely pointless process that resembles nothing of the real life process. EA wants the draft to feel authentic but you cant have a draft without a scouting process that makes sense. A few points going to a tiny portion of players isn't scouting its a joke. The only way to really scout in this game is the same as last year. Step 1 SIM THE DRAFT, Step 2 write down the draft order and rankings on a sheet of paper for each player you like, STEP 3 Re load your save from before the draft Draft with confidence.

Thats it folks, the rest of the game is last years madden with a new cover boy. Is it worth $60 NO but that is why EA is starting their subscription service! They themselves are aware their products are not worth full price. Just like ever year this game will be $30 bucks by Christmas. Save yourself some cash and wait like I plan on doing. Youre old madden will work just fine until then.",This years madden will look just like last years (360 version at least)
B0001I9YGC,2.0,"Ironically, I had preordered the console version of Call of Duty long before I had played the PC version.  Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over.  However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment.  I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best.  However, I was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level.  That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed.  I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me.  The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the ""war is hell"" theme.  The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the ""steeking Germans"" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner.  The death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back.  I played this game for only an hour before I filed it away with my other games.  I imagine that I will someday go back, but in the meantime, I'm having too much fun with the PC version.",Lost in translation...

First of all I would like to know why the hell your not Gabe Logan in this game!?!?!  Sure you can create your own agent but it doesnt feel like a Syphon Filter game without good old Gabe!  Now he went from being a professional agent to doing paper work.  Well atleast you get to work for him or so you think.  Through the whole game your taking orders from this annoying women(that I cant remember her name) who is always  freaken  yelling and being a smart ass every time you make a mistake. They could of atleast had Gabe tell you what to do because I would respect his opinion at least. Second of all this game is freaken hard.  Your enemies take like 15 shots each even at point blank range and your freaken map is impossible to freaken read.  And your enemies continue to come back to life. You kill all the enemies then you leave then you go back there and all of them are alive shooting you again. I also didn't know what the hell was going on half the time.  All the sudden it would say ""OBJECTIVE FAILED"" and im like ""what objective?"".  Plus in order to beat the game 100% you have to play online.  WHAT THE F***!!!! Since when has anyone made a game were you have to be online to beat it 100%.  I did like a couple things about the game.  It had pretty good graphics and the sound effects were also very realistic.  But overall it just didn't feel like a Syphon Filter game to me. It just had too many mistakes and was just way to frusturating.

B00GLZQO30,2.0,"My original subscription date is January 17, 2005. I've been around a bit. This is now my fifth day one expansion launch and I can honestly say this has been the LEAST enjoyable expansion I have played. It feels like they huddled around a table, couldn't come up with anything different so they decided that we'd go back to Draenor since Burning Crusade was a fan favorite. So much of this expansion is recycled, it's pathetic. Even half of the music is recycled - Burning Crusade's music is found in EVERY zone.

Leveling is a tedious slog that is made only marginally less annoying by the bevy of ""Timeless Isle"" type 'rare' monster mobs that can drop loot and Garrison supplies. And you'll NEED those Garrison supplies if you want to do ANYTHING meaningful with your professions or at end game, let me tell you! By level 100, early end game should just be called ""sit in your Garrison all day in between farming normal dungeons"" because that's all there is. Good luck, alt-o-holics: Trying to manage multiple alts with multiple professions will be a full time job, worse than it was in any other expansion (and yes, I remember the hell of Burning Crusade mote farming; I'd rather have that back).

I won't mention the bugs and stability issues because, frankly, anyone who has played an expansion at launch should expect such things. In fact, my experience is that these issues have been tame compared to every other expansion launch. But that doesn't save the game from being a bland, mind numbing experience with the story telling prowess of Michael Bay (turn off your brain and enjoy the spectacle). Not even a week in and I'm hearing sub-level 100 guildmates complain about being bored with the leveling process and Garrisons and I can sympathize because I'm there too.

Maybe the game's just passed me by or maybe I'm just burned out, but I'd rather take Cataclysm or Mists of Pandaria's early double and triple-gated faction dailies over this.",Expected better from Blizzard.

B000GKCI4A,2.0,"Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is almost a good game. Almost, but not quite. Instead, the story is kind of dull and aimless and the graphics are clunky and, as a result, this game comes up a bit short in my opinion.

Pros:
-Tons of content. By the time you're done completing both the main storyline and the side missions, you'll be up around 100 hours of gameplay.
-A large world with interesting geographical elements.

Cons:
-Poorly-designed menus. It really is a pain navigating between sections, especially once you start to accumulate a ton of random keys and potions and stuff.
-Lots of Loading. Pretty much every time you enter a building or jump from area to area, you'll be met with a load screen that might last twenty seconds or so. This can start to feel excessive after a while.
-Awful facial animations. This game was built using a graphics engine that was outdated even in 2007. The faces of NPCs look as though they were carved out of balls of dog poop by a retarded third grader.
-Bad third-person mode. While first-person games are intended to make the player feel as though they're experiencing the point of view of the main character, they tend feel less realistic to me than a third-person game. Unfortunately, the third-person mode in this game feels even more detached, what with the manner in which the character seems to float across the ground and flail wildly and inaccurately during combat.
-The story is practically non-existent. Between all of the side missions and guild quests, one kind of loses track of the main story, which involves closing some magical gates or something. Thus, you don't really build up an emotional attachment to the world or any of its inhabitants.

After a while, the game devolves into a repetitive pattern of getting a quest from a NPC you don't care about, fast-traveling to the specified location, killing someone or grabbing a special item, fast-traveling back and completing the quest. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Bottom line: There are better RPGs out there, ones that look beautiful and keep the player invested. A lot of people love this game. I'm not one of them.",Could be Better

B000HKIPGE,2.0,"There is a growing trend out there that seems to believe that games for a portable device should be shorter than the console variety, this game bolsters this belief. A scant few hours long, this game builds on the lore of Silent Hill, but doesn't delve nearly as deeply or as terrifyingly as the previous iterations. It is, perhaps, unfair to compare every Silent Hill game to Silent Hill 2, considered one of the scarier entries in the series, but it is hard to ignore this.

The graphics and ambience, including sound, were perfect, but the level of involvement was lacking. The environments were dark and disturbing, the game allowing you to shift from one world to another, finding new items in each as you move from one to the other. The controls were a challenge at times, the movement laboured and the attack buttons limited by the weapon held by the protagonist. At many times in the game, I opted to run through a gauntlet rather than be outnumbered and cornered. As with most Silent Hill games, the choice is between health and standing and fighting. There is never a lot of health or ammo around, though there were a variety of melee weapons, all of which broke after a few uses.

This is a decent entry in the series, but didn't impress me in the least. I do admit I did not play the game in the dark or with headphones, probably increasing the scare factor, but the story ended in a way that made it the antithesis of a Silent Hill game. If you find this for under $10, then it might be worth it, otherwise, it probably isn't worth the investment of time or money.",A Portable Game Low on Scares and Story

B006J5UDG6,2.0,"for a Tritton headset, i was expecting it to be far superior to previous bluetooth headsets that ive owned but its not. first off when compared to my last headset (sony ps3 bluetooth headset, the first gen.) it feels like its of a cheaper plastic and doesnt feel quite as ""solid"". second i would say the quality of voice/chat/mic is a bit lower than the sony headset. some of the players sound a bit too quiet, so to try and fix this u can turn up the volume. however now the people who sounded normal and not quiet, become too loud lol. third, the charging stand that it comes with can be a little difficult to use. what i mean is that the headset doesnt easily click into place, unlike the sony headset does. instead you have to fumble with it until u see the led light turn on. :( fourth, this headset does not have the notifications that show up on the screen. on the sony headset, when u mute the headset, change the volume, check the charge level, or disconnect the mic, you get a little notification on the screen which is pretty convenient but with this u dont...

and lastly,  im not sure if its just my headset or somethin, but when u are quiet enough, u can hear some faint noises in the mic (sort off like a quiet clicking) which is really annoying. most of the time i don't focus on that because i'll be hearing other people talk or hearing gunshots and explosions from the game, but then when u are quiet, u hear the damn scratching, or clicking noises in the mic. once again, REALLY ANNOYING

 i think the only good thing about the mic is the cool design it has. and it does fit nicely on my ear lol. but thats the only pro.. if u want a good reliable mic i would go for the official sony ps3 headset. plus its about $20.00 cheaper",only good thing is the design
B001IK1BJ0,2.0,"Would I buy:  No
Would I rent again: No
Would I recommend someone rent this:  Maybe, but if someone asked me about it in the video store I'd say no because I might see them again and they might want to beat me up if they spent their hard earned money on it.

I'm not sure who is writing all the 5 star reviews for this game, but I think I've been playing a different video game.  I really liked this game the first couple of hours I played, but since then its been an uphill battle to keep me engaged and I've finally given up and returned it to the video store.

I've been playing it on hard mode as a mage for over 10 hours and its been a little challenging in terms of fights, but the game play for fights isn't that great.  You generally have a group of 4 character and you can switch between them.  You do have skills and spells that can activate, but I wasn't impressed and every encounter was pretty much like the last encounter (except for boss fights which are exactly like all the other encounters except they take a lot longer) so, coupled with the extreme amounts of conversation time, I finally just got bored.  Basically, the fighting is like playing a diablo game: repetitive and predictable.

It is an impressive story with good writing and interesting characters, unfortunately this is a video game and not a movie.  Your game play time seems equally split between conversations and actually interacting with the environment, which wouldn't be bad if your conversations impacted the story line but most of your choices seem to have limited impact.  Its a lot of conversation time, and, while the conversation and story are interesting, the basic game play goes something like this: 15 minutes of conversations, then 15 minutes of killing things, moving around, or finding stuff, repeat. [I tried to start a rogue character but after 20 minutes of meaningless conversation choices I just gave up and took the game back]

The level advancement system is a pretty standard one.  Each level you get to assign attributes and a few skill points depending on your class (fighter, mage, rogue).  I found the amount of time between levels to be appropriate.

Also, the world isn't open by any stretch of the imagination.  You can't even walk through shallow water areas and there are artificial boundaries everywhere to keep you on a preset path. You're forced to auto travel between areas.

I read a lot of people with 5 star ratings go on and on about the story and they're right: its a good story.  You'll spend 30 minutes out of every hour standing around listening to excellent dialog, good characters, and good plot; in that respect the mediocre fighting and questing actually get in the way.  Other reviews have gone on and on about how great an RPG this is and the wonderful complexity of morality that it displays; my only response is ""I really don't know what you're talking about."".  There are so many dialog choices to make during each conversation and they are all pretty stereotypical.  I've actually role-played for years in the Dungeon and Dragons systems and clicking on scripted responses to scripted dialog is not role playing.  You basically choose between one of four types of responses:(1) super polite (2) polite yet curt (3) dismissive or (4) irritated/angry.  Occasionally you will have to choose between either forgiving someone or slaying them in cold blood.  Not really that complex and while most of your dialog responses aren't that important there are a few that are; if you're not paying close attention you can accidentally threaten to kill old ladies or something equally extreme.

If your idea of a great game is spending hours of time listening to scripted conversations, choosing scripted responses to ""nuance"" your character, and engaging in repetitive, diablo-like fighting environments, then this is the game for you.",Detailed story but very little fun
B000VBFW7E,2.0,"Gears of War is a game that could have been great....but fell far short.
I hope you like staring at a black, white and gray screen for hours at a time because that is about the only colors you are going to see throughout the whole game!!!

Ever play a first person shooter before? Nothing new here. I am not going into the minutiae like some people do. Here is the whole picture synopsis.

This game offers something different in the way of weapons and the movements of your character. You do and don't get the typical machine gun. Yes, it is a machine gun but it feels and sounds solid and futuristic when playing this game.  Your movements are interesting. You can cling to, duck behind and walk along walls for cover like you have always wanted to. Peek out, shoot around the corner then duck back behind it.

Sadly, that is the whole scheme of the game...peek, shoot and duck. Wash, rinse, repeat. Thankfully, the enemy will try to flank you, run right up to you and throw grenades at you. That definitely keeps it exciting.

Tell you more about the grenades? OK. They are cool looking, they are powerful and the throwing system is unique. And it is also very disappointing! You hold your Mouse 2 button to create a ""throw path"" for the grenade to follow. When ready, you click the Mouse 1 button to throw it and BOOM! This works great when you are on level ground. In many cases, the camera angles for the throwing system completely prevent you from seeing where you are throwing the grenade. Effectively neutralizing your aim. Also, you can only carry 4!!! Yes, a measly 4 grenades.

Which brings us to ammo. There are no health power ups or armor power ups to go hunting for. You automatically regenerate these when you are not being shot. AWESOME! Ammo is abundant and you can pick up your dead enemies weapons, allowing you to switch weapons and stock ammo to your hearts content. Again - AWESOME!

The biggest SUCK factors of this game are as follows -
Video is excellent but the colors are only gray, black and white.
Game play is fast and fun but it gets repetitive.
No save system. Checkpoints....YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The game is entirely scripted so you know when the enemy is coming every time.
When you die, you are forced to go through some of the same cut scenes over and over!!! Some can be skipped, others cannot!!!!!
It feels like they ported it from the XBOX 360 instead of making a solid version developed specifically for the PC.

Overall, it was OK. Not bad, not great. I played a friend's copy so luckily I did not have to actually pay for it. I definitely don't think it is worth $45. Maybe $30. No way would I pay more.","I hope you love staring at black, gray and white !!!"

B008XMSRKC,2.0,"So this game has problems.  I want to suggest it but honestly the problem is that it does not know who it was made for.  I am an avid RPG fan and this game's premise seemed so interesting to me.  The part that sold me on getting it was the ability to change memories and having that immediately affect the person you are with.  Just doing this as a play feature could have been very interesting.  But those are the special moments in each subsection.  They are not the main playing mechanic.  There's closed off levels of uninspired platforming that lead you to boring brawling sections that you get to create customized fighting combos between 2 buttons.  And by customize I mean pick wether the punch or kick is healing, punishing, or cooldown reducing.  You don't really pick the length of the combo or order of buttons.  The story is very interesting.  Gameplay is meh.  So most of the gameplay is not that good.

PRO:
+ Interesting story
+ Memory changing portions really cool

CON:
- Unfocused gameplay.
- Bad platforming
- Ignorance of core audience
- Poor fighting mechanics.
- Rare use of memory mechanic

B00005A7FK,2.0,"This might have been a great game: if it had been released about six years ago.  This game is a Myst clone that came out about five years too late.  ""Clone"" is a bit too much of a compliment.  ... is a slightly better phrase, because this game falls short of the excellent series that it aspires to be.
The graphics for the game are simply awful.  The screen looks like a drenched comic book that just got pulled out of the gutter.  Perhaps it is because the game is fixed at 640X480 resolution when most computers can go way higher.  It looks like some effort was put into the artwork for the game, but it is spoiled by the smeared-out, grainy look that occupies every screen.  ""Riven"" is much older and looks better.  So does ""Grim Fandango"".  The voice acting is abominable, and so is the acting for the game's in-game movies.  I thought that we got rid of those years ago when everyone realized how cheesy they were.
If the game had a good premise, then the poor production values wouldn't matter very much, but it doesn't.  It's another ""abandoned world full of weird machines"" game.  This time, it's an alien world.  A good puzzle game has to have puzzles that fit into the virtual world.  Unfortunately, ""Schizm"" has lots of contrived puzzles that don't make sense.  Want to walk across a bridge?  Figure out how to push a series of 20 buttons in the right order.  Don't expect to just push one button.  Apparently, aliens are extremely bored geniuses who have nothing better to do than build complicated contraptions that confuse Earthling scientists.  I wonder if aliens have to push a series of color-coded buttons in a special order to operate a toothbrush.
I'll give the game props for having good music and, yes, the puzzles are very difficult.  If you are up for a challenge, they will definitely do that.  It's hard to get interested in them though, since the game always constrains you along a tight path instead of letting you explore a 3D world.  That's another big fault that this game has when you compare it to other adventure games.  Here's a tip:  skip this one unless you have played all other adventure games that you want to play first.  I played ""Myst"", ""Riven"", ""Sanitarium"", and the ""Syberia"" demo, and they are all better than ""Schizm"".",Yuck
B00DDXILBQ,2.0,"There is so much wrong and annoying with the gameplay that it cancels out any of the fun elements. First, the server does NOT SAVE you where you left off, which is highly annoying! I should not have to replay one area multiple times because it does not put me where I actually ended. Second, the aiming sucks---and I mean really sucks. One of the things about Rainbow 6 that was fun and challenging at the same time was the aiming---you had a small dot that replicated what it is like to ""really"" aim and fire at targets. This game totally fails. Your actual aim dot is at least a full inch to the right of your gun which makes it VERY hard to shoot the enemy when things get hot. I spend time trying to find the sight--which really just should never be an issue (for instance, Fallout 4, Destiny, Borderlands have reliable sights). Third, you cannot crouch! At all! Sure you can hide behind stuff, but you cannot sneak, cannot crouch--all you can do is hide behind something, stand up and shoot, then hide again--which is not the same as being able to shoot from a crouch position. Fourth, to be fair I am not a fan of 3rd person shooters---the angles are terrible and there is no precision. Why they made this game 3rd person I do not know because it is very annoying. The angle wobbles all over the place and tries to position you in ways you do not want. Deadspace is 3rd person, one of my favorite games of all time, and it has much better view controls than The Division. It would be nice (Like Fallout 3 & 4) if they gave you the option to be either 1st or 3rd person. It is easy in the Division to get stuck behind doors, walls, cars, you name it. Fifth, one dude with a baseball bat can kill me with ONE swing but I have to empty a clip into him before HE dies!! WTF?? I hate games that do that to players--it's disrespectful.
There is really no ""post-apocalyptic"" feel to this game at all. The images do not really set up any apocalyptic feel and it's not like you can't find health or ammo. The missions are pretty standard and the screen is just too full up with stuff. The graph with the health and ammo is literally right in front of you --bottom center screen--all the time, which is very annoying. And story?? What story--there really isn't one. You just go into random buildings
and shoot people. Overall, a disappointing and annoying game to play.",A disappointment....

B00004U8K2,2.0,"I was thoroughly disappointed in Mafia. I hate to say this, because I really wanted to like this game, and for the first hour or so I really did. But as the game progressed so did my frustration.
It's true that Mafia has it all - wonderful graphics, engaging story, interesting missions, action, even music. But there are a few pitfalls that turn it from a great game into a so-so game.
First, even though I did not really mind all the driving, most of it bears absolutely no purpose. The racing mission was absurd. If I wanted to race sports cars I would've bought a racing game. C'mon, people, NOBODY liked that mission! What was the point of it? But I stuck with it, forgiving them for the obviously annoying and pointless part, yet it never really got better. If anything, it got worse.
While I can see they've tried to make many aspects of the game ultra-realistic, it's really anything but. Here are some points about that:
Point 1: I understand that the vigilant cops and traffic violations were put into the game to make it seem more realistic. But how come that running people over or bumping into other cars leaves the cops indifferent?
Point 2: The police cars are the fastest cars in the game. No matter what car you're driving, even a race car, they WILL catch up to you and arrest you. Yet when later in the game you get to drive a police car, the other police cars are STILL faster than you. Makes any sense? To me neither.
Point 3. The game is happening in the 1930s. How in the world would a cop measure your speed? How could a cop walking on the sidewalk know what the speed of your car is? Yet they all stop you, cops in cars AND cops on the sidewalk.
Point 4. The cops only seem to be after YOU. Whenever you have to chase after someone in your car, of course you have to speed if you want to catch up with them. Yet if you do the cops will run you off the road and arrest you for speeding. Never the other guy. Same goes for the ""hide weapon"" feature. If the cops spot you carrying a gun they will arrest you, yet there is one mission where you start with the gun in your hand. The sequence loads, you don't even have a chance to hide your weapon, and immediately the cops spot you. Forget trying to get away. The only way to finish either mission is to pray there are no cops around when the mission starts.
Point 5: If you reload while your gun still has bullets in it, you lose those bullets. Only a fool would discard their half-used magazine in real life. In fact, in the military they encourage you to reload as often as possible, because this way there's less chance to run into an empty magazine.
Another thing that might not be a problem for other games but is a huge one for Mafia is that it's a very linear game. It gives you very little room for creativity. In one of the first missions you have to collect money from a gas station and then carchase and kill the guy that stole the money. Before going into the gas station I shot the tires on the car, just in case. But when the very nest sequence loaded the car was driving just fine. The game consistently points you in the right direction, and there are no rewards for exploring on your own or deviating from the main plotline (unlike in games like Morrowind, in which you can progress any which way you want).
And of course, the most frustrating aspect of the game is your inability to save games. Honestly, I can't comprehend why game developers do that. Is it so difficult to put in a savegame feature? Mafia is not simply a game where you cannot save, it's an _extremely difficult_ game where you can't save. Who wants to spend two hours going through the same mission over and over again? Did I mention that the conversations written into the missions repeat as well, and that you cannot skip them? After spending 2,5 hours on one of such missions only to get killed in the last two minutes of it and have to start all over again, I finally gave up. Sure I want a game that's challenge (I play all my games on ""hard"" or ""realistic"" difficulty setting), but I don't want a game that's a total frustration roller-coaster.
Mafia could have been a real gem. It could have easily been an epic classic of the gaming world if it wasn't for the aforementioned downsides.","Promising, but falls short"
B013F45W7S,2.0,"2 stars for lackluster Ubisoft support.

1) They don't support the G29 on the PS4.  Let me rephrase: they don't support the official PS4 wheel.  I read on their forums they said they are working on it in December 2015.  May 2016, and still nothing.
2) Once Ubisoft decides to drop servers for this game, it will be nothing but a paperweight since it is an online only game.

The game itself is great, but it is clear Ubisoft doesn't listen to their fans (probably because of the heavily fragmented game genre they are in).  2 stars to get Ubisoft's attention, 4.5 stars for the game itself.","Great game, poor support"

B00CP1DUW2,2.0,"I'm a shooter and RPG gamer.  Someone recommended the game Remember Me. He said it was one of the best games he ever played, so I bought it.  I wish I would have known this was an arena fighting game.  First the good.  The graphics are fine.  Episode 2 in ""good"" Paris shows off its graphical beauty.  The audio is fine.  The story and characters are okay - although NOTHING like you'd find in some shooters and most RPGs - which is what I'm used to playing.  Compared to them, this is a shallow game.

Now to the parts I didn't like.  The game is the very definition of linear.  You have one narrow path to follow without deviation. Sometimes there is a little alcove along the path with some goodies to pick up, but other than that, it's usually a dark narrow straight path you must follow. This is the very opposite of ""open world.""  The paths lead to arenas where they close off and you fight.  Since I have not played fighting games, the combat system seems very convoluted and complex.  Stringing together combos and timing hits take a lot of practice.  The boss fights have several stages and it usually involves running around dodging and evading so you don't die instantly and then you have to figure out which part of the boss to attack first.  If you can complete that attack without dying, then comes the next stage, then the next, then the next.  Each part usually takes a couple minutes to complete.  So, the entire boss fight might take 8 minutes or so.  If you die at any stage, then you start the entire boss fight over again.  It's a matter of trial and error.  So, I might figure out how to defeat the first stage after a few tries and then the first and second stage, then the first, second and third stages, and then finally get to the fourth stage - which is usually the hardest stage.  Then, if you die, you must start completely over again.  So, you look at the clock and realize you've been fighting this boss for 45 minutes straight over and over again.  Eventually, I will make it all the way to the end and defeat the boss.  Was it fun?  No.  And that's the problem.  Video games are supposed to be entertaining and enjoyable - not tedious frustrating tasks.  About halfway through I decided to stop because there were SO MANY other games I had on my list that I wanted to play that I knew would be MUCH more fun.  My friend really liked Remember Me.  But for me, I ended up quitting about halfway through - which is something I rarely do.","A Cumbersome, Tedious, Linear, Arena Fighting Game"
B00IVHQ0KI,2.0,"This was so close to being great, especially for the money. But this wheel has two major flaws. Once you get all set up, you realized that as you turn the wheel, there is nothing to anchor the base. to imagine trying to drive your car but steering wheel column keeps shifting on you. In addition (the pedals have the same exact problem). It's very sensitive. You may be able to change a setting somewhere but I didn't look long enough to find it. As the wheel snaps back to the 12 O' clock position, it wobbles back and forth a bit which makes your car go all over the road. This would be manageable if not for the first problem.

If they made a simple tweak or two like adding more weight to the base or putting suction cups on the base to create counter torque when you turn, this would be a great product.",Too light
B00KWDC4FY,2.0,"***BE CAREFUL THIS DOES HAVE SPOILERS***

  This is the reason why I'm not buying MKX.  It has a lot of bad micro transaction and dlc.  Preorder bonuses was bland and special editions where not available on pc (pc is also broken and not getting all the content).  I actually enjoyed the story even though I feel it was rushed.  Another thing I didn't like about the story is it tried ""too hard"" to break cliches.  1st gay character, 1st african american female character, 1st female protagonist saves the world, 1st mixed race romance, father mother gender roles swapped.
 Art style looked worse than last.  Graphics are obviously better, but something about the faces of the characters looked washed out (just in my opinion).  Next thing I didn't like what they did with covering up and reducing of all the female characters because of the pressure from the  highly controversial feminist movement in the gaming community right now.  Strangely enough it kind of looks like they did that for the guys too...  To me that is a little ridiculous because of how violent the game is and they don't tone that down at all.  Also if they wanted to go with more realistic characters like back in the day because they used real actors/models.  Why not do that again and find irl busty/muscular actors/models?  Another thing, why not leave a option to turn gore off/on and the same thing with sexiness of the game?  Hell if it costs them money to make more skins, say if people want them, go ahead, make them, charge at a decent price.  Example of good dlc/micro.

The only positive are the maps. Most of them are well designed probably better than most BF games. Where it fails is everywhere else.

You can't upgrade existing weapons with new scopes or larger magazines, If you want something with a better scope you have to get an entirely new weapon.

Like to snipe? Don't bother. They did not add an orange icon above heads to spot someone from far way, the opposing teams do not look different to easily tell between a team mate and an enemy.

The sometimes have a red symbol above them but this does not stay.  The colors are washed out so enemies blend to the environment and can rarely be seen

The upgrade system is total s***! It takes hours in some cases to rank up. Once someone is shooting at you forget about running once they have you in their sights by the time the first round hits you you're already dead.

The other thing that really really sucks is the spawning. I've spawned directly in front of an enemies gun.

Bullets sway more with wind direction and rarely can you take a target without giving away your location.

Finally, my biggest complaint is how slow it is. You have to wait for everything. When you finally get a battle pack you have to wait through a 4 second useless animation.

Maps take forever to load and once they load you have to wait for everyone on your team to be ready.

B0001X5YN4,2.0,"I was going to write something clever like ""One word review:  Uninstall.""  But that's not really fair, so here's what I really think.  And I should preface this by saying that I do tend to be turned off by games that are rough around the edges.  Glitchy UI etc. will frustrate me and eventually I'll stop playing - that's just me.  So having read other reviews, I probably should have known better than to take my chances with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

Anyway... There's a lot to like here but its mainly in the way of recognizing what the game is trying to be, rather than what it actually is.

As far as what actually works, the sense of vulnerability in a wide-open hostile environment with LOTS of enemies and realistically fallible weapons... it's great, and probably what's earning the (undeserved?) 8/10 ""official"" ratings everywhere.  This much starts out a little frustrating, but grows on you as you catch the learning curve.  There's a real challenge here that blends action and strategy very well.

But that's about all that works.  The visuals are pretty lame on my (2G, Athlon 3800, NVidia 6800-based) system because dynamic lighting is out of the question.  Anything other than static lighting yields frame rates down around 1 FPS.  (That's not a typo.)  Sound is sometimes effective, but mix and positioning are often confused, ie. is that ground cover shuffling under my feet or machine gun fire in the distance?  Who knows?

The rest is really, really broken.  And I'm sure some of it works in some measure because a lot of people are toughing it out and really enjoying themselves.  And that's great.  But if there's a core story line that makes sense for the very patient, it is absolutely BURIED in content that makes no sense whatsoever.  I would write this off as bad translation/localisation, but it is not merely that the dialog is hard to comprehend.  It's also that missions begin and end (fail, more often than not) with no apparent reason.  When there is an apparent reason - ie. an NPC is completely incompetent - it's every bit as frustrating.  The PDA and especially the map are very non-intuitive to navigate. (Maybe it works, but not as I'd expect... not even the 2nd or 3rd way I'd expect.)  I could go on and on.

The final deal-breaker for me was the dreaded inventory page.  The game is challenging, so you'll hate to leave valuables (namely, ammo and the weapons to deliver it) behind.  But you will be forever burdened and wondering what to keep, what you can afford to leave behind.  The inventory screen that pops up when you loot a corpse is marginally different than the standard one (not so much that you won't constantly forget) and it somehow makes the process of looting a corpse and unloading the precious bullets from his weapon and then unburdening yourself so you can actually, ahem... walk... very, very tedious (and frequently deadly.)

But maybe that's OK since most other loot is useless.  Artifacts offer ""tradeoffs"" that can consistently be reduced to:  using this item will improve armor slightly but also kill you slowly.  Hmm, trick question?  And saving things for resale is also pointless since, as many have bemoaned, the game's ""economy"" is non-existent.  There are few vendors with nearly nothing of interest, and currency is mostly a non-concern.

Others have complained that the faction system is broken, that the game and the NPCs do not react any differently based on your interactions with others.  I can't confirm or deny because I'm never sure who's friend or foe until the first shot has been fired.  At me.  And that's every bit as much fun as it sounds.  And then, sometimes, I'm still not sure.

Sigh.  I really wanted to like this game.  I already spent the money, already wasted a weekend, and on top of all of that, it's a very cool concept.  But there's more bad than good here, plain as that.  This game didn't leave me feeling like a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so much as a S.U...  You get the idea.","Ambitious, overrated, flawed."

B000FRS9II,2.0,"Perhaps I was influenced by all the hype this game received, but I truly believed this was going to be the game by which all next-gen games would be judged. If so I'm depressed.

First the graphics. They're certainly good but to me they appear to be crisp renditions of animated characters. The environment everyone raved about in reviews is again good but monotonous. How many burned out cars can you see? It just didn't overwhelm me as expected.

Now for the AI. I heard how ""intelligent"" the enemy characters were. Truth is they aren't. Not at all. Even playing on the hardcore difficulty level I tired of watching enemies run forward to hide behind an obstacle only to immediately stand up and start to back-pedal back to the obstacle they just left. If you don't eliminate an enemy quickly this same repetitive pattern of gaining territory and voluntarily and inexpliocably abandoning it occurs over and over. Occasionally the enemy will try a flanking move but so far its usually very obvious, easily defended, and once the flanking position is gained they'll give it up using the above mentioned back-pedaling retreat.

The only thing that makes the competition difficult is the fact that despite executing a perfect head shot the enemy somehow manages to continue to fight unfazed.

Your squad mates? Lets just say I'm tired of saving Dom over and over again.

Gameplay - tedious is an understatement. I find myself forcing myself to continue to play just to finish the game and be done with it. The game is completely linear with you running from one objective and one obstacle to another fighting essentially the same recycled enemies. Its call of duty without the realism or entertainment value.

Oh and there are plenty of glitches. I just turned off the console after one of the enemies climbed over a concrete barrier and remained suspended in mid-air, completely unresponsive and unable to be killed and thus unable to move on in the mission. I've also actually had to shoot a teamate to make them move out of the way of a doorway so I can continue the mission without having to turn off the console and start over.

Overall not worth the money and if this is next-generation without hope of improvement I'm depressed. I'll keep playing and see if the game improves figuring with all the hype I must be missing something, but somehow I doubt it.",Falls short of the hype

B00ZGRLJJS,2.0,"I was EXCITED when this game came out. I heard that this was the SAME company behind Viewitful Joe and Bayanetta 2, so I thought ""How could this be bad?"" I learned all too soon about the devastating truth.

The first thing that I suggest is to look at the gameplay trailers that Platinum has released pre-launch. Those trailers only display the best parts of the game. They don't even tell you about the awful pitfalls that you will stumble into.

Now with that out of the way, the platforming in this game is very much like it is in a Mega Man game. The whole platforms vanishing every few seconds bit, is what I mean. This would not even be a problem, if it were not for the game's camera. It has a tendancy to put me in an awkward position in seven out of ten situations. I don't know about anyone else, but I rely heavily on the game's camera to pin point where these platforms are at.

Aside from this, the game is NOT the proverbial nod to Transformers G1 like they make it out to be. The decepticons using shields and not being stronger then the autobots, the autobots needing ammunition for their weapons. The autobots have NEVER needed ammunition, because their bodies run off of energon. So it's a stupid mechanic that is forced on you and was partially responsible for ruining my experience. The autobots being able to take down Devastator. Only the dinobots, Omega Supreme, and the combiners could do it, but Bumble Bee being able to trash Devastator is a joke. I expect something to actually be a nod and not a blatant attempt at making money off of people who want to find a good game.

The game also has a severe problem with sharing information that I consider to be valuable. Oh it sure, it tells you which moves to use, but it never tells you what you are supposed to be doing. ""Oh look, I see a mission over there! I bet that's it!"" And then you find out you were wrong.

Now out of all that I hated about the game, I loved the graphics and the voice acting. Though a game should never be built on it's multimedia capabilities.","It didn't have The Touch, it didn't have The Power."

And there were glitches galore, which have pretty much been well covered in the spot lighted reviews, but I encountered one in a level in which Brian was sneaking around (which encompasses all the Brian levels) and the way Brian got through the level was by wearing a costume that would disappear but come back as soon as he hid in the shadows.  After the first time I ""died"" in the level, when I came back as Brian the costume was gone and there was nothing I could do to get it back, and I couldn't beat the level without it, so I had to restart the game from the beginning so I could beat that level.

Was getting tired of using those cheap L shapes key drivers and they feel nice to use and fit flush.,Tools Were The Best Part.
B004774IPU,2.0,"I finally got around to getting Civ V a year later. Can't say it was worth the wait. I'm just happy I didn't drop the initial $50 they were asking. It's an inexcusable retread. It looks pretty, like every new version of Civ (I've been playing since Civ 1) they spend energy on graphics but do little under the hood. I keep waiting in vain for real substantive changes in the game. The new city states are alright but I think religion, espionage, and corps, dropped in this version are more fun and strategically challenging. I've never been a warmonger so I was looking forward to the non-stack tiles, but I gotta say, it's actually kind of annoying. You spend an inordinate amount of time playing shuffle-puzzle to move the units around.  This wouldn't be so bad except we are still (5 versions on) doing one move = one year. So getting your units across an Atlantic sized body of water still takes six or seven years.
Diplomacy is STILL ""I'll trade you my cookies for your Twinkie.""I could go on but with the exception of the long awaited hex tiles (thank you!) this is the exact same game as Civ 4. Oh wait, there's one other big difference--the Steam based play. I've played Assassin's Creed and other games that require you to be online and it's never been a problem, so I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. But Uplay doesn't force pop-up ads on you. It doesn't fire up at startup and throw alerts at you when you're trying to get work done. And it doesn't take 10+ minutes to start the game (this on my hot-rod Vaio that nothing slows down). Maybe all this would be worth it if Civ 5 was a real upgrade in game play. But the whole thing is recycled. Even some of the sound files are the same as 4. The nation specific score they were touting sounds like cheesy midi-files of cultural clichs. The new voiceover guy is fine but he's no Leonard Nimoy.
The unit sprites are no better than 4, and the leader animations will remind you of the gyrating heralds of Civ 2.  The endgame is still interminable and inexcusably boring.  I almost never play conquest, but Civ 5 even managed to make conquering the world a tedious chore by the end. Don't get me started how Civ 4's absurd cultural victory has been made even worse by turning it into social policy bingo! If you have Civ 4 BTS you need go no further.  This franchise needs a serious adrenalin shot if it's going to survive. I for one will not pay $50 every few years for the same game in a new box.  I'm going to write this one off as a loss and go back to BTS.",Keep your money. Stick with IV
B007A9UDME,2.0,"It's not like all other final fantasy games where it's turn based. This one is more of waiting until your special bar fills to a certain amount to use something and some moves take more than others. If you don't attack fast, then you get hit and it's just not what it used to be",eh

B000G0JD66,2.0,"I have recently been considering getting myself a PSP. My friend came over today and apparently brought his along, so I decided to play it. More specifically, I played this game. Being a fan of Sonic's handheld escapades, I was hoping this would be an at least decent play. OH DEAR GOD WAS I WRONG!

The plot revolves around Dr. Eggman having built a device that turns things into....cards. Of all the things you can of, they went with cards. Even more nonsensically, Sonic's friends (and the Master Emerald...?) have been turned into cards and were kidnapped by Eggman. Then we have Shadow, Knuckles, and a hedgehog from the future named Silver (Sonic 2006 IS erased from being canon after all) join in on all this. It's all silly in a dumb way, really.

The gameplay is played on a 2D plane and focuses on having to race against the aforementioned characters to reach the finish line at the end of each level. There are 6 Zones, with 2 Acts and a boss in each. It's kinda like the Vs Mode in some of the portable Sonic games on the Nintendo DS (and Sonic Generations 3DS). However, there are multiple powers/traps you can use against your opponent and vice versa. There's also a special power the character can use on himself. For example, Sonic can Boost for a moment.

While it would sound kinda neat, the levels are structured horribly. I feel sorry for Dimps, because the company's usually been criticized for putting in Dash Pads and springs in their Sonic games. Well, this game's not by Dimps, and these levels contain more Dash Pads and springs I've seen in any other Sonic game! Even when there are no springs or pads in sight, although there are a few multiple routes to take, the structure of these levels is SUPER LINEAR, and you get absolutely no time to explore because you have to race against completely stubborn AI! One level (Crystal Mountain Act 2) left me with frustration to no end, and part of why is because of freaking Silver, who seems to CONSTANTLY gather traps to use on me! On the contrary, the last zone, Meteor Base, left me with total relief, because I do not race anyone, but rather a time limit that gives me enough time to finish the Acts.

The bosses are nothing special. They are more-or-less played in a similar manner to the bosses in the Nintendo DS Sonics. The catch here, however, is that you, for some reason, have to race against an opponent to see who can beat the boss faster. Fortunately, unlike the actual levels, the AI here is pathetic, so you do not have to worry about not beating the boss fast enough that much. Meanwhile, the final boss feels more like a massively uninspired level instead of a boss.

Overall, this is just a miserable excuse for a Sonic game, let alone a portable one, considering how the handheld series has always had great offerings. The tragically simplified and linear 2D racing can only be fun for so long, and the game as a whole is just plain underwhelming.",Playing the wrong cards
B00XUZBCIG,2.0,"I can't say I'm all that pleased with NHL 16. The games problems far exceed its thrills. If you're not an avid hockey fan or player, save some money and stick with NHL 15. Here's why.

Cons:

THE GAME DOES NOT RUN WELL - It continuously freezes on menus forcing me to restart and I haven't played an online game in Hockey Ultimate Team without bad lag that interrupts play. EA needs to fix their servers, but I haven't seen that yet.

PASSING IS DIFFICULT - For some reason EA removed pass assist. So if you're not pointing directly at the player you want to pass to or anticipating where he is going, your player will randomly pass the puck to nowhere. The puck usually ends up on your opponents stick giving them scoring chances. It also make cross-ice passes and one-timers much more difficult than before. This is the biggest con and really ruins it for me since I can't seem to set up good plays.

INTERCEPTIONS ARE TOO POWERFUL - Defensive zone passes are even harder than NHL 15. If your opponent or CPU player gets his stick anywhere near you, the pass will almost always be intercepted or redirected. Simple plays moving the puck up ice to an open man are extremely frustrating.

THE PLAYER ICONS ARE TOO BIG - EA decided they wanted to change the player icons and colors from the previous games. My guess is some actual changes needed to be made to justify a new $60 price tag one year later. The new round, much larger icon takes up a lot more space on your screen and is pretty irritating in my opinion.

The game isn't all bad. Here are some improvements over last years version.

Pros:

SHOOTOUT MODE - The Online Shootout mode is awesome and probably the best part of the game. You and your opponent go head-to-head, taking turns as goalie and shooter. It's hilarious how bad the goaltending can get. Making for some pretty sweet replays.

LOTS OF OPTIONS - More game modes, unlike NHL 15. You can pay HUT, GM, EASHL, Be a Pro, Playoffs, Seasons, and more.

NO MORE GOALIE INTERFERENCE CALLS - If you played NHL 15 you will understand this one. In 15, every time you get near a goalie they call interference and a two minute minor which was extremely unrealistic. Search it online, you'll see. Now the goalies can take a beating without penalties.

HUT IS STILL FUN - Hockey Ultimate Team is pretty much the same but still fun and addicting. Buy and play your favorite NHL players!",Disappointing
B000BC38LA,2.0,"((Before you read the below review, please note that since writing it, I have updated my review after downloading and installing a major patch for the game.))

I don't mean the review I'm writing to beat down this game.  It is an amazing game to be sure; from my somewhat limited experience with it, I can tell.  I absolutely loved the predecessor to Oblivion (Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition) and was dying for the next sequel to come out.  I've been playing it for three weeks... or at least, I've been trying to.

I'm going to say it right away, as a warning; If you don't have a brand new computer with the newest specs, don't buy this game, at least not for your PC.  My computer is not 18 months old and cost me about $2,600, including an upgrade to the maximum two gigabytes of RAM, but according to Bethesda, the 1.6 gigahertz Pentium M processor I have will not allow me to play the game as it should be played.  I am incredibly frustrated.

I've been able to play enough to know that Oblivion is exactly what I was hoping for.  The graphics, if my computer had the ability to run everything effectively, are amazing.  My computer isn't fast enough to run everything as it should be run.  The sword my character carries flashes as I walk, blinking in and out of reality, which wouldn't ruin the game for me in itself, but everything slows down in the heat of battle and when there are multiple opponents, everything moves as if in cartoon frames.  Now I realize that there are points on the game map where everything on the screen locks and turns to white, and I lose control of play.

In short, I'd love, love, love this game if I had a brand new Dell XPS gaming system for $3,500+, but I don't.  Therefore, this game was pretty much a waste of $45.  Within the realm of Tamriel, I can't go to the places I need to go and do the things I need to do.  My computer locks up.
I can't express my frustration, knowing that this game, in its full glory, must be mind-blowing.

I wonder at what point the technological standards for games will not require up-to-the-instant-new supercomputers in order for them to be played?  I've just finished paying for the computer I have (a Dell Inspiron 8600 which I love).  I can't upgrade the whole motherboard.  And I certainly can't afford to purchase the kind of computer that would run this game...  Not after finally paying this one off.  AUGH!

By all means, if your computer is a thoroughbred, BUY THIS GAME.  It's going to be the game of the year again for certain and you will probably have several months of enjoyment with it.

If your computer is not a Ferrari, then steer clear of this game.  Your frustration will run deep.

*** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE *** UPDATE

Just after the online patch was made available, I downloaded it and installed it.  The above-mentioned problem was one shared with several users of this game, and I'm very happy to report that after the installation of the patch, the game runs very, very nicely on my computer.  I do not have the video settings set to maximum; not by a longshot; in my opinion, you still need a brand-new, loaded, $3,000+ computer, I think, to have Oblivion play at 100%.  With such a loaded computer, the game play of Oblivion must be absolutely amazing.

Now that I've installed the patch, I can go to all those areas which I wasn't able to previously.  The frustration of having the game lock up is no more, and I must say it's truly one heck of a ride, and I wish I could change the overall rating to at least 4-stars instead of two, but it seems that I am not able to do so.

I will go further and say that I've enjoyed the overall game so much more since the patch was installed that I've purchased all the online modules available for download on tne Oblivion website, and I encourage other Oblivion owners to go check it out.

After the patch, Oblivion is a great place to visit.

*** UPDATE # 2 ***

Last thing; if you go to the Oblivion website, there are links to some pretty good, fairly inexpensive modules to download and expand your game.  Still having fun, thank goodness for the patch!","Oblivion is Amazing... Much, MUCH better after Patch was made available"

Found out after purchase unfortunately - was expecting something close to the Badlands series and hopeful for the split-screen gameplay. Not so much though - online only and weapons are custom to character. Cut scenes are just atrocious, and long and no way to skip. Graphics are mediocre and it's pretty much a straight-through gun fight with some tower-defense elements. This is going to get squashed by Overwatch based on reviews I'm seeing.

Quests are incredibly repetitive, and they're what you'll do most of the time since there are so few activities. The gun selection is limited, making long-term play boring.

It is far from inferior as far as anything else FPS you play online. I understand that this is my opinion and there are people that disagree with me on this, but, I could not finish this game because it just seemed to take FOREVER for the story to go somewhere, and the multiplayer takes a LONG time to get in a game while if you do, you are dead within seconds of playing by veterans of the series. There is no curve or forgiveness for learning the multiplay ability aspect.

B00005KBRD,2.0,"OK so after my first session playing... the graphics are astounding, the game play is a little realxing but fun, its sort of Nox meets Unreal and pretends to be Diablo.
But its crashes about once an hour (on a 1ghz Athlon, raid, 32MB ATI, 128MB CAS 2) irregardless of settings. And when I say crash, I mean crash, its brings not only the game but also my usually impervious win2k system to its knees. No task manger, no reset, hard power cycle only!! I don't remeber any of the Diablos crashing ever, or the Baldur's Gates... typical Microsoft, releasing something late and expensive and unfinished!
There are tons of cool ideas in this game but its a bit like the original arcade Dragon's Lair once the wow factor is over you have to live with the limitations...
Everyone should see this game but I wouldn't reccomend anyone actually buy it. If you're short of cash (or sensible about such things) then wait for Neverwinter Nights - most likely a much better investment...",Mmm great graphics BUT typical MS programming
B00007JZB3,2.0,"This review is not intended to thoroughly downplay the qualities of this game.  The graphics are stunning -- unlike anything I've ever seen before.  The music is great, especially the opening sequence which would have worked magnificently on the silver screen.  (I won't go into story details; you can get that easily enough.)

But, fellow TRON-fans, this game just isn't worth it.  The gameplay is fun only to a degree.  It's addictive, certainly, but only in so much as you keep on wanting to see that pay-off cut scene (which sometimes come and most of the time do not) or that grandiose image or situation that has a big connection to the 1982-hit film -- which, let's face it, is the whole reason why we're playing this game in the first place.

Also, there is no payoff at the end.  I watched the ending animation clip and thought, ""That's it?  That's all you're going to give me for all this trouble?""  For, make no mistake about it, this game is a lot of trouble.  I played it on ""Easy"" (there are also ""Medium,"" ""Difficult,"" and ""Insane"" levels) and it was tough.  After awhile, I felt like I was just being challenged for no reason and my character was wandering around.  It was like reading an 800-page book that could have been condensed to 300 pages.

I think most people who bought or will buy this game are doing so mainly because of the unique opportunity to explore the TRON universe.  The gameplay is just an added bonus.  Unfortunately with this game, the universe you're exploring occasionally looks like the film you saw as a kid, but overall it's been revved up with extra icing and eye-candy and less actual substance.

I think the game could have been a lot better if it had looked much more like the movie.  Or perhaps if there had been gameplay scenarios like the movie.  Yes, there are a few.  For instance your primary weapon is the memory disc (that frisbee-looking thing) and there are light-cycles galore.  (These things earn this game two stars from me instead of one).  Perhaps we just weren't ready to jump immediately into the 21st century.  Maybe they could have divided the storyline into segments: one key chapter of the game taking place in the 80s (perhaps right after the film takes place), one in the 90s, and a climactic finale present day.

Those are my two cents' worth.  And I hope for the sake of a possible sequel that they echo many of the desires of other fans as well.",I'd hate to say it: But it doesn't really deliver

B00004U3GL,2.0,"This game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers. Sure it is good to get 9 wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street. But once you play it for a week or less, you get really tired of it. I suggest selling your Dreamcast and buying a PS2 or an XBOX which both have better (wrestling) games. Thats why dreamcast went broke. It had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games. Most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of. The rest was all sports.

B00ZGI8MEW,2.0,"EA is definitely going into the right direction, but it's still a long way there. The graphic is definitely better, most of the players look like the players, and some don't really. They made the body of the players a little realistic, because last year everyone is jack up on steroids. I really love the shot meter, it's simple, and it follows your jump shot, instead of 2k stupid meter that's on the player feet. The Pro Am was really fun, it's quick, simple, not too much waiting. The EA sever was really good, not too much lag, and control was responsive, its literally day and night compared to 2k. However despite all this great things, the game is really lacking in gameplay. The animation is choppy, and the game feels choppy. The AI is really dumb, and a lot of recycled animation. When player drive to the hoop they will do the same dunk and the same crazy hook shot that magically goes in. Stealing the ball is impossible, no matter how much I swipe at the ball, I end up with nothing, just a ridiculous animation of my guy bouncing off the other player. Shots are too easy to make, and blocking is non existence. Overall it doesn't feel like a basketball game, this feels worst than playing nba2k13. EA is definitely trying, hopefully EA fix their gameplay and animation for next year and they will have a really solid game, and they the benefits of a better sever compared to 2k.","NBA Live is on the rise, but still long way there"
B01GW3ODBU,2.0,"The game is still good as always.

Here are the negative and they are mainly bugs.
-Many obvious bugs that should be fixed are still existed. No Unofficial Patch that fixed many bugs.
-NCP disappear constantly. Multiple of them can disappear at the same time. This due to the fact that they spawned inside the city but in the exterior area of it. They gone for good. So it's a game breaking bug.
-Constantly crashed and the error is CE-34878-0. This have been reported in many people that received the update 1.3.
-The sound can be off during fight.

So without the update 1.3, expecting NPC to spawn in the exterior of the cities. With this update 1.3, expecting to crash within 10 minute of gameplay. These are two major bugs that broken the game right now.",The game is still good as always but with game breaking bugs
B00FF5KYME,2.0,"My son is an Angry Birds fanatic, and given there are only a couple of other kid friendly, non-sport games at the PS4 launch (Knack and Marvel LEGO being the others), I wanted to get him the Angry Birds Star Wars for the PS3.

But let's cover some other things first...
- Yes, essentially, this is the same game you have on your Iphone, Ipad or Android device.
- Yes, it's $50 vs. .99 cents (or $2 if you want no ads)
- Yes, I'm probably a dad who spoils his son :)

There are literally only 3 differences from this game and the .99 version:
- 20 exclusive levels that you cannot access any other way.  So if you are the completionist/perfectionist type, you've got to shell out the $50 (Or wait until it's $10-15, but that's still quite a markup for only 20 levels!
- The definitive, graphical version of the game (But the pigs will die regardless of how shiny they look!)
- Multiplayer modes so you can show your friends what $50 will buy.

In all seriousness.  The reason I gave this 2 stars vs. 1 is because there is *just* enough extra here that if you have a really die-hard Angry Birds fan, they can find plenty of enjoyment out of it.

But PLEASE, for the love of all things sacred, take the $50 you would spend on this game and get a year of Playstation Plus.  Not only will you get free games for your PS4, PS3 and your PS Vita, but it will also let you play online on your PS4.","Overpriced, yes please hold onto your money..."

*battery life is pretty short especially with polling rate at 1000 which is what any normal person would use it at.
*my mouse 4 button came with a defect where it is almost always pressed in completely. it works still but there is no audible or click feeling when pressed.

Not Amazon's fault (they fulfilled this)--they sent me a full refund including shipping, which was awfully nice of them. And the Amiibo, when it did show up, was just fine--works great with my copy of BOTW, which is why I wanted one in the first place. It's a little pricey, considering it's an effing statue of Link, but if you're more the collector type then go ahead.

B0012N746W,2.0,"How fitting that 2008, the year that Lara Croft reached her lowest point, is also the year that gave us Nathan Drake, a far more appealing and engaging treasure hunter/adventurer. The styles of the franchises have oft been compared, but where Lara breaks down and fails Nathan Drake excels.

Core Design had been swallowed-up by Eidos at this point so it was left to Crystal Dynamics and Nixxes Software to bring this to consoles, and they did a pathetic job. Even software students could do a better game than this. The camera is epileptic, which is agonizing for a game that requires precision timing and judgment. The graphics are bland. The action is dull. Levels are long and boring with too much detail on meaningless treasure hunting (the Platinum depends on you getting all 179 treasures in the game, but it's glitched, so you're screwed) and not enough action.

B00C71034I,2.0,"Of the three Batman: Arkham games, Origin is, in my opinion, the worst of the three. Why was this game made? The story of this game should have been written to make it the third and final game of a trilogy. Clearly, it was only developed to rip off comic book enthusiasts who are interested in video gaming. The story is flawed by comic book canon - If this is the first time Batman meets Joker, then why are Black Mask, Bane, Firefly, Deathstroke, Deadshot, etc. in the game? These others are introduced later in years as Batman and Jokers rivalry intensifies. And even if you were to cram all these rogues into 1 game, make the story have multiple layers and be long from just a character interaction standpoint, not dopey side quests and silly hidden item goose chases!!

B00005Q8IR,2.0,"Some reviewers loved all Balder's Gate-related phenomena, I personally thought the story was shallow and lacked anything to really define motivation. Ostensibly ""to let the player be the character"", your character instead comes across as a vapid individual who has no personality or real lines. Some people liked the ""twist"" of getting caught up in a plot with magi and demons, but I found it more like an accident and never felt a compelling reason to continue beyond ""I haven't beaten the game yet"". Castle of the Winds, a now-freeware game for Windows 95 did a better job of getting an adventurer to set out on a dangerous quest.
Story: 5/10

If you've played PS1 or PS2-launch titles, you're not far from what you'll see here. The scenery looks nice, but character models are unimaginative and relatively bland. While your appearance changes based on armor, it's not a drastic change and the benefits of new equipment aren't much different than ""a new coat of paint"". The camera is fixed at a slightly offset top-down that generally doesn't hide obstacles but also doesn't give you a satisfying way to navigate. The lack of differentiation between non-interactive terrain dressing and potentially useful objects like item boxes is also unhelpful. Not terrible, but the lack of distinction brought the score down.
Graphics: 5/10

Unexceptional sounds at best, some were annoying. Volume can't be controlled in-game, and the voicing ranged from ""bad rivaling cheap kung-fu dubs"" to ""modestly compelling"", with most of it being unimaginative and repetitive - particularly the shops, who won't shut up while you're trying to shop.
Sound: 4/10

Little actually stood out, but after having been through soundtracks like .Hack//G.U. or Ace Combat 5, I expect music that won't be missed in an empty elevator.

Enemies are difficult - you may like or dislike this - but they don't respawn, so if you want to practice or level grind, you have to save character data and start a new game, then import. Random drops and inconsistent ability - enemies tended to hit every swing even if they weren't at optimal range, whereas everything from bows to great swords to daggers had a tendency to miss - not dodged, but simply doing nothing. The fact that everything has a single swing as its whole moveset was especially disappointing, at least Gauntlet had reverse-strokes instead of the same chop time after time.
Gameplay: 4/10

You can import character data into any game load that you please, but as awkward as the game felt to play through in the first place and as miniscule as the benefits of revisiting an area are (especially with the steps you have to take), I just can't in good conscience recommend this when there are so many other games that actually let you have fun throughout, and then games like Ratchet & Clank let you cruise back through the story with all the goodies you earned.
Replayability: 2/10

B003YC4D9A,2.0,"The first and most important to thing to note is that this product is not produced by Nintendo. I would count myself as being somewhat savvy about noticing such things, and yet, I fell for it! lol. If you look at the manufacturers of this product listing, it says, ""By: Generic."" So, keep that in mind. I bought this so I would have a second controller for multiplayer games like Goldeneye, and it does not at all measure up to the standard set by Nintendo's excellent Classic Controller Pro.

Having said that, just because it's a third party doesn't mean it's a bad controller. Sometimes, third party controllers are the best controllers you can get for a system (see also: the N64). But this controller is pretty bad when compared to the Classic Controller that's manufactured by Nintendo. There are a several noticeable problems:

Of primary concern is the wire that goes into the Wii Remote. It is not firmly attached into the insides of the controller. Not long after using the thing for the first time, the black wire came out a little and exposed the controller's internal wiring. That's actually a small safety risk, so keep that in mind if you intend to let your children use this device.

Of secondary concern is the fact that it's pretty crummy when it comes to actually controlling video games. The analog sensitivity is too high. In some games you can adjust this, but in most games, you cannot. To make things worse, something has actually changed inside of the controller over time, and now the analog sensitivity is just absurdly high.

So maybe it just sucks for 3D games, right? Maybe it'll be better for 2D games like A Link to the Past? How could they screw that up? I don't know, but they did. The D-pad is very stiff, and you just can't count on it for 2D games that require very quick movements like Pokemon Puzzle League.

For those of you with softmodded Wiis, this will be important: This controller is essentially unusable with the Homebrew Channel. There's a response time delay even while just browsing the menus, so you definitely cannot count on it for playing Homebrew games.

In short, spent the extra money and get a Classic Controller Pro from Nintendo. If you're going to buy it from a place such as Amazon, make sure the listing says that it's manufactured by Nintendo.","Usable, but steer clear of it."

B000R0URCE,2.0,"the story of the game is sound.  There are a few things that sorta clash with the movies, but for the most part, it works.
The game play is horrible.  This game was rushed.  The AI is borderline too good - on the normal setting.  There are levels where you can't ever get up because the AI shoot you, and you fall down, and by the time you recover, they shoot you again.  The whole Force Powers are great, except as soon as you get one set of force powers, there's a bad guy that cancels them out - and oh yea, they are the only type of bad guy on that level.
I understand the point of having bad guy types that can resist your Force Powers, but there, not as bad as the game is.
The Star Destroyer level is perhaps the single most frustrating part of video gaming I have ever played.  This part is the reason why I give the game 2 stars instead of 4.
I got the game for two reasons, 1. I thought it would be fun to run around and use Force Powers on storm troopers - it is, for the first half of the game anyway. 2.

How many of you guys remember when Pac-Man was hopping, bopping, and using a grappling hook in the Super NES game,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pac-In-Time/dp/B000035Y5X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pac-In-Time</a>?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Or-when-he-was-busy-trying-to-right-his-25th-birthday-gone-wrong/dp/B000A8NXEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Or when he was busy trying to right his 25th birthday gone wrong?</a>

If there was one thing Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures tried to get out there, it's that Pac-Man is alive and kicking, and ready to appeal to a new generation of fans. So...what happened? Why is the result a generic children's cartoon featuring all the usual tropes of generic children's cartoons? I even saw a couple episodes, and my opinion still stuck with me.
It's interesting that this Pacworld takes place in a futuristic setting that's NOT apocalyptic for once (Never thought I'd see that again!), and that Pac is in high school (I'm 17 at this time). Unfortunately, the cartoon fails to capitalize on anything, and just plays it safe with the typical characteristics of a kids show.

So how is the VIDEO GAME tie-in?

I was highly concerned about it, considering I really enjoyed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pac-Man/dp/B00000K1VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pac-Man</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-games/dp/B00005YVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World games</a>. They were 3D platformers that were short, but sweet and full of life. Well, actually, Pac-Man World 3 was a different story, but that one was still enjoyable. That game had a speaking adult Pac-Man whose voice is pretty neat actually, and the interaction/dialogue, while a teeny bit cluttered, surprisingly provides some genuine laughs.

Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures throws all that out of the frickin' window!
It's still a 3D platformer where you go from point A to point B, yes, but the entire game is so...so...SOULLESS!

No offense to the voice actors, but the voices provided for both this game and the cartoon make me outright cringe, especially poor Pacster here. Thankfully, there's an option to mute the voices entirely, but then what's left in the audio department is a soundtrack full of uninspired and forgettable orchestrated tunes. What happened to catchy soundtracks that you can hum or bop your head to? Heck, I even prefer PMW3's orchestra over this - At least its music was still memorable in some way.

Anyway, let's get down to the actual meat of the game.
What's confusing is that the game really doesn't PLAY badly at all. Pac-Man controls just fine, and there's an unexpected amount of power-ups to play with. The problem, however, is that everything is so ungodly by-the-numbers it just feels like you're going through the motions rather than actually being engaged. The levels do not stick out and feel quite bland and dull. Those two adjectives describe the game as a whole, really.

I probably would've given this game a higher chance, but again, Pac-Man has triumphed in this very genre a number of times before! And I will always come back to those games because they are FUN, something this game purely lacks.

B0050SY4DG,2.0,"I manage to finish this game recently and figured I write a quick review on what I thought about it. Tthis game is nothing like the other resident evils there are way too many quick time events, explosions and cut scenes. I can't understand how the developers let this game go down this path soo far from what made the residents evil series from Zero all the way to four so great including code veronica which was my favorite. The storyline made no sense to me even when I played the other characters to see their point of view. The controls had my character moving all over the place plus the cover system and dodge were awful. Did I mention how many annoying quick times events there are in this game? The game follows this pattern the entire time ""Cut scene - Explosion - Qte - Cut scene - explosions - Qte"" rinse and repeat over and over again. This series is suppose to be about survival horror not a Micheal bay film! All in all this was my least favorite in the series and I didn't think anything would beat resident evil 5 in that regards.",Couldn't get into it.

I'm a sports gamer and I miss the days when there were a dozen football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer and golf games to choose from! Though playing the same sports each game felt different! Game companies would take risks and the competition made them do and add more!

Tiger woods 14 made me so mad at EA for wanting to charge extra $ for courses that used to be included in prior games! They can do that though because of the lack of competition!

Madden has just felt like the exact same game for years! I get it, the graphics and gameplay have made their improvements in recent years but I still want the game to play different! I know this is a slam on EA but this goes for 2k sports and Sony etc. as well!

B0009A4EVM,2.0,"Whenever someone does something inventive and inspiring buy that, don't buy its sequel.  The sequel is a rehash of the first at best, and at worst the creator either hadn't the energy to do something creative, and just threw together a standard knock-off. Note such sequels as Alundra 2, Suikoden (what is it now, four or five?), Wild Arms, etc.  Sure the original was great at one time, but unless you find one that broke the mold, or the story is so interesting and developed that it continues through several games (from what I read of Kingdom Hearts in plot spoilers it's not quite that developed), it's not really worth it.

The only instances where a sequel outperformed an original is where it managed to be more creative than the first: such as Legend of Mana using nonlinear plot sequences and a learning system of battle (before, the SD3 sort of went in this direction, with its choice of party altering the story), or the Final Fantasy series which despite the reputation for being streamlined, each Final Fantasy is an experiment with a new battle system.

B000NGQ26C,2.0,"STORY-

Dawn of Mana (henceforth referred to as DoM by me) is an action-RPG platformer hybrid set in the isle of Illusia. A boy named Keldric and his friend Ritzia live peaceful lives in harmony with nature...at least until the tiresomely predictable antagonist shows up and manages to ruin everything in less time than it takes you to say `plot device'. Keldy and his fairy friend, Faye, must rescue Ritzia and save the world from evil. Seriously. That's about as far in depth as I can describe it, because that's mostly all there is to it. Save the girl, defeat the darkness and restore the universe. It's not the worst story I've ever seen, and the presentation is excellent, but I really wish RPGs would stop with these sorts of narratives. You would've thought that they could have come up with something a little more original than `brash teenage boy on a quest to stop evil and save the gentle hearted damsel in distress', but no. Obviously not.

BATTLE SYSTEM-

Square apparently realized that the Kingdom Hearts style of combat was an excellent choice for RPG-adventure-platforming games and it shows in DoM. Keldy can jump around and swing his sword in a simple combo attack, much like Sora's Keyblade. What sets DoM apart from KH, however, is the fact that Keldy can whip out a handy vine to grab objects and fling them around, thus damaging enemies and panicking them. In theory, it sounds like a good system to work with, but there are highly noticeable flaws with it. Number one is the abysmal lock-on system. While it honestly doesn't sound like a very difficult thing to get right in a game, Square has somehow managed to botch the job completely. It frequently locks on to targets in the background and ignores the foreground, even when the opposing force is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. You can cycle through targets, but there are often so many objects on the screen at one time (rocks, crates, etc.) that by the time you've found the enemy you wanted, it'll have already hacked off your limbs.

Number two is the physics. DoM implements the Havok Engine, which also happens to have been used in Half-Life 2. However, the physics engine seemed more bothersome than innovative for me, especially during combat. If you get hit by an enemy Keldy will be sent flying backwards as though he's in outer space. The only thing you can do when this happens is watch him go up in an arc and then land face down, refusing to move, while the adversary gnaws on his gonads. Frequently, you will have to panic enemies by throwing things at them, but this gimmick quickly becomes repetitive in of itself. What could have been an interesting combat system was broken down to the bare basics of picking up, throwing, and then bashing the enemy with the same combo you'll use throughout the entire game. Fun? Maybe for a little while. Long term? Absolutely not.

GAMEPLAY-

I feel as if any more comparison to Kingdom Hearts will be redundant, but something has to be said for the similarities between the two. Considering that KH is an extremely lucrative franchise, it doesn't surprise me that Square wants to replicate as much of the successful formula as much as it possibly can. Despite their valiant efforts, however, a lot of what made Kingdom Hearts entertaining hasn't been reproduced very well here. DoM uses a chapter-based system to advance the plot meaning the game sets you loose in an expansive environment to explore the level(s) and eventually defeat a boss, thus ending the section and moving on with the story. Keldy can gain experience by panicking enemies with thrown objects and then, once the enemy is defeated, picking up medals that will gradually increase his stats. The ONLY WAY to get these items is to panic the enemies. You're forced to continue picking up, rolling, throwing or breaking objects simply so that you can advance in the game. Using a sophisticated physics engine is one thing, but blatantly pushing it at the consumer is another. The vine ability would have been better utilized as an `extra' - something useful for acquiring greater amounts of medals or simply stunning the enemy. The fact that it feels like such a necessity didn't sit well with me at all.

Even worse than that, however, is the fact that Keldy's level resets to 1 every time you begin a new Chapter. This means that you'll go through the process of gaining and then losing stats eight agonizing times during the course of the game. What do people want to get out of RPGs? Well, a feeling of accomplishment, of course. By nullifying the stat bonuses at the conclusion of each Chapter, DoM effectively kills any feeling of productivity and progress. I felt like I was starting at the beginning of the game each time by health was reduced and my attacks became drastically weaker once more.

All that said and done, the environments are all unique in their own ways and each has a distinct `feel' to it. However, a lot of the time, I felt simply lost and without a clue where to go. There's a small radar in the top right hand corner of the screen, but it's about as useful as an umbrella during a hurricane. It provides your destination, but it fails to account for whatever obstacles may be in your way while trying to get there. Frequently, I felt as though I was being forced to blaze my own trail: something I don't particularly enjoy in a video game such as this (it was fine in Shadow of the Colossus). DoM is tight-lipped with hints and mission objectives, which is a problem considering how large some of the levels are. My overall feelings were those of confusion and frustration. It's far too easy to get lost, and when you do, there isn't really a way to find out where you are or how to get where you're going to.

But I'm not quite done yet. Since DoM is a platformer, I would've expected that the controls be at least decent. Unfortunately, much like every other aspect of the gameplay, they failed to impress and frequently irritated. Keldy's movements often seem to lack fluidity; he runs as though he's on the moon and his jumping somehow manages to be even worse. Couple this with the game's ragdoll physics and you can bet that you'll be falling off most of the platforms you're supposed to be jumping on. The camera is just as obtuse as everything else. It's difficult to control and tough to position behind Keldy, making for an all-around mediocre experience.

VISUALS, CHARACTERS and AUDIO-

If there's any praise I can squeeze out for DoM, it's most likely for the appearance of the game itself. Although the core gameplay mechanics are a mess, the graphics themselves are beautiful and detailed. The animation during cutscenes is usually quite good: it's full of eye-candy. I'm a sucker for video games with sharp-looking design, but we all know that it can't carry the entire thing. There aren't really all that many characters, and the ones you do meet are never very well characterized. Keldy doesn't differ in the slightest from the many other teenage RPG heroes, or if he does, the distinction was too subtle for me to notice. To be fair, the voice-acting for Keldy and co. is above average and generally believable (if not a bit hokey at times). One other area in which DoM excels was the sound. The musical score is fantastic, and there were several tracks that I actually enjoyed listening to. In these respects only, DoM is one of the better RPGs I've seen in the last year or so.

OVERALL-

I genuinely wanted to enjoy Dawn of Mana, but there were noticeable blemishes on the gameplay that marred the experience for me. It's a bit of a love-hate relationship: I couldn't help but be drawn in by the art and music, but was ultimately deterred by the horrendously broken controls and unsatisfying level-reset system. It didn't help that the story was only average and the characters were the same archetypes you see in every RPG these days. I'm glad I rented it first, and anyone else thinking of buying should probably do the same if they don't want to be disappointed.",Incompetent Controls.
B003QOWQYU,2.0,"Fist thing you need to know is that I really enjoyed the original. I think it was way to expensive for the price they were asking for in the beginning, but fun none the less. Having said that, this game took every problem with the original and made it worse. The games system is way to complicated now, it took me forever to calibrate this thing to my tv properly, and I have yet to find any music I can stand on this game. There might be good music, but I gave up after the first 5 sets of rap/r&b mixes. I suppose if you like that music you would enjoy this game, but I was looking for more of the electronica and euro-club type music. It would seem that they forgot about that genre completely.

What I didn't like about it was the touch sensitive volume control among the other things that were controlled via the touch display. Problem was it wasn't like your touch screen phone, it was a cheaper version. The volume control was what I had the most trouble with. The other thing that drove me to getting a new keyboard was using W.A.S.D. on my FPS games. I had to press and hold the keys down very hard in order for my character to continue moving the way I wanted him to. That was a bit ridiculous and I'd never had a keyboard like that before.

B00006LEM9,2.0,The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring was a wonderful idea.  Black Label games has a good reputation and their game the Thing seems to be one of the reasons why.  This game however is a definite pass.  You start the game as Frodo which would be fine except that you aren't given any real sense of what to do.  There is no map of the shire so all the quests you need to perform mean that you have to wander around to complete them rather than going straight to where you need to go.  Also the load screens are many and take a VERY LONG TIME to get through.  Maybe a mini game during them would help...  I've heard that there are more errors and problems in the Xbox version so I decided to leave the game at the fact that they should have taken more time with this one.  The game's graphics are not what they should be.  The cut scenes are more what the graphics should be.  Gandalf has been rendered very poorly in this game.  The game could have been SO MUCH MORE.

B005EZ5GQY,2.0,"I was hoping for a great sniper game, but ended up being disappointed.

The first problem I found was how the game is a third person shooter with the exception of when you aim through the scope of the sniper rifle. The switching back and forth between third and first person is jarring and immersion breaking, and the handling of the third person aiming and cover mechanics are rather poor.

Beyond that, the campaign missions are formulaic, repetitive, and extremely linear. Enemy AI is laughably poor and generic, offering little challenge even on higher difficulty levels once you recognize their patterns. Weapon selection is almost non-existent, and the choices you make in what extra equipment to carry are generally superfluous due to searching enemy bodies and abundant ammo drops.

The one bright spot for me was the close-up/X-ray kill camera, but even that grew old after seeing them so many times.

Overall, I can't recommend this game as a purchase. It is much more suited to a weekend rental, as the re-playability is rather limited after you complete the rather short campaign.",Sniper Mediocre Would Be More Appropriate

Luckily, I have not experienced any of the glitches like a lot of the other Amazon users seem to have, and I think that may be because I have downloaded all the patches.
First off, this game comes with almost NO new items, and the ones it DOES come with are dumb in my opinion. I feel like the Sims 3 doesn't really include that many items, so that's typically the main reason that I buy expansions. I like to decorate my ""Sim House"" just like I would a real house, not with Mummy Tombs or Tomb Statues... What benefit are those?
Also, I think that the ""traveling"" is a little lame. It's not like you could just go as a family to relax or anything... You have to do missions the whole time, which are really just clicking and clicking and clicking. There's no challenges whatsoever.

B000FQBF1M,2.0,"Shooting in this game is one of the most refined I have ever played. the graphics are incredible, but....

If the game was just about shooting forward and watching the bullets hit it would be a 10.

Unfortunately the game suffers.

There is no story what so ever, the acting is about as poor as I have ever seen. Most noticeable is that when your fighting the AI just continue to pop out of the ground indefinitely, for ever. You can shoot at them all you want and they will keep popping up out of the ground, you could shoot 100,000 AI and it would make no difference.

The ending of the game relies so heavily on re spawning it makes you think ""what where they thinking during the 5 years of production"".

There is no climax to this game, each level is the same, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, the next scene, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, that is it. That is all there is to it. You have a brief moment in a tank that controls like an awkward mess. Each level is almost exactly the same with a different background.

What makes this game more disappointing is that it took them 5 years to make it and this is all they could come up with.

Its more based on you walking forward than defeating the enemy. You will enjoy picking it up and shooting, but will likely get bored once you realize it doesn't make much difference how many guys you kill, they just keep popping up and just running forward isn't much for strategy.

Adding some vehicles, story, acting, some variations and cut out all the res pawning, this game could have been in the upper 9's.

B0000690OR,2.0,"Yes folks, it's sad but true, but this game is a very poor port of the PC version. I wonder how the programers could waste the potential this game had on a machine that delivered us a firt gen game like Halo. I was excited about this game; although even the PC version is a less than fantastic game, i kind of liked it. Than comes the time for the Xbox version, and what a disappointment. The graphics are a mere shadow of the PC version. Like the other reviewer said, the cutscenes are terrible, i couldn't beliave my eyes. The graphics are bad for even those who never played the PC version. Not that i don't think that Xbox can recreate the graphics of the PC version, because a machine that can deliver us games like Halo and the wonderful ""PC port"" of Return to Castle Wolfenstein certainly can do that. Ok, the graphics are bad, but the gameplay is still good, right? Wrong, it feels like the programers didn't pay much attention in porting the gameplay to the Xbox control, because it's very jerky.

B000WQ4KHQ,2.0,"I read really good things about this game so I decided to check it out, but I wasn't very impressed. The game is essentially GTAIV, but you can't kill people or steal cars.

I like that they were able to capture the whole city, but I think that the graphics suffer due to the vastness of the game.

Everything happens at night, so it's not so much racing as it is just trying to dodge the headlights coming at you and figure out where you're going.

It's really easy to hit something and get spun around and have to start from scratch in the race with your horrible car and awful acceleration. All the people you race against have cars 10 times better and they never make mistakes, so you have to drive almost perfect to win races

Even when you do win the races, the amount of money you get is too small compared to the prices of the newer cars and specs; unless you're awesome at this game, it takes forever to get a car that's worth driving.

Also, the cops start chasing you at least 30% of the times that you race and after the race is over, they keep chasing you and forget about the five people you were racing against. Since the amount of the fine for running from the cops is based off of how long the chase was, by the end of the race, you end up having to give the city $1000 which is most likely more money than you got from the race....so you're back at square one. And after you finish a race and the game goes to the results screen, it cuts right back into the action after you've seen the results...this means your car starts going 160 mph all of a sudden in an intersection after you've fogotten what you were doing.

I guess this game is good if you like squinting and racing again and again and again with the same stupid dialogue to try and get more cars, or if you like being beaten again and again in the face with a hammer

I guess I'm biased because I didn't think GTAIV was that great and this uses the same engine, so it's basically the same game. I was expecting ridiculous graphics since they say that every vehicle used 1 million polygons, but good luck trying to see anything. You're moving too fast and it's dark, so I had trouble appreciating the beauty, and the sounds of the engine were almost identical on every vehicle to me.

Maybe I just suck at racing games, but in my opinion this game is not worth the money, and I don't understand how so many people can like it.

Save some money and get one of the older racing titles that cost half as much.",Not that great

B00006FXJG,2.0,"Well, I was looking forward to checking this game out, but I ran into a few problems along the way. The game came in an older style box with a CD style case holding two CDs. (one install and one play.)  It installed on my Win 10 Pro system without a problem, but that's the last thing that was problem free.  I'm aware that running older games, etc. on a newer OS can cause problems but I've found, that with a bit of work, you can find solutions to the problems for most games. (If not the original game then a port that will work.) I opened the configuration util and set the items for my system and it took me to a web site no longer in use and a drive by malware attack took place that caused me to close the system down for protection sake.  After that,  when I first tried to launch the game I got the black screen and that was it. I had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to close the game as it took control of my mouse and wouldn't let me close it. After this happened two more times, I decided to uninstall the game. I couldn't find an uninstall setting in windows programs settings and I ran the games uninstaller instead and it went really fast. As is my normal procedure, I checked to see if the removal had worked correctly. Guess what....No dice. game was still there. So I had to uninstall the game by brute force approach and that's always not good. After getting rid of the left overs, I decided to look for ways to run it before reinstalling it. After checking out a Google search, I found that this was not a isolated thing and a lot of people ran into this. I also found that a program could be used to get the game up and running. So I got the program and, following the instructions, tried to run the game. First time it failed and the black screen was back. Second time the game did run but was blinking so much as to be totally unplayable.  I tried a number of options under the program but with no success. After that I tried a number of shortcut settings but no luck. At the end, I had to admit this game wasn't going to run for me at this time and so that's how I came out. I wasn't able to really see how good the game really was as it just wouldn't run.. Very sad.

B000HCQK0A,2.0,"Okay. This was just a nightmare of a gaming experience. Just, unbeliavably terrible. Just downright horrible. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be a bad game for ten years ago. Or maybe for 2001 or 2002, as a late N64 or PS1 title. But considering this game is pretty recent,it's downright inexcusable. So why is this game so bad. Well, to sum it up, it's EXTREMELY hard, to the point of frustrating. Not to mention randomly spawning enemies. That's right. Randomly Spawning Enemies, like the kind you'd find in a Nintendo Mega Man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen, more enemies show up. And what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity? Why, even MORE enemies! ""A hit squad has been dispatched to take you out."" Add this on top of a game that has really no direction, no storyline, or even point to it, and there's not even any reason to play it. It ain't fun, by any definition of the word.

Basically, you're a genetically made SuperSoldier who is created by ""The Agency,"" all of the nation's law enforcement combined into one agency, and you're told by some annoying old disembodied Commander voice -who also serves as the game's narrator and the only actual ""character"" in the entire game- to wipe out three criminal empires. And off you go shooting, to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game, if you can even bare it that long. ALL you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops, and while the latter may sound fun in a Spider-Man sort of way, it really isn't. At least Spider-Man has webbing to control where he wants to go. You know, flying would be a whole lot simplier. And easier. Oh yeah. The game also has some very poorly conceived races. Either a rooftop race, which are usually extremely hard to beat in time, or some insanely stupid driving race, which if trying to drive isn't hard enough for you, trying to complete a Time Trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edge.

When you start, all of your skills - Agility for leaping, Driving for absolutely nothing, Explosives for bombing, Strength mostly just for health, and Firearms for shooting- are all poor and barely usable. And after you've leveled up all of them as you go along in the game, well... they're still extremely poor. The only thing that increases is the leaping ability, in which you can go from 10 to 30 feet in leaping height. The sprinting speed sure don't increase like they say it does, that's for sure.

Driving, is more or less, utterly pointless in this game. 95% of the time, you'll never be in a car! Which is good for two reasons because, for one, Driving controls are really really retarded. Both in setup and manuevering. That's how bad it is. Bad in the ""it's almost impossible to not run into civilians"" sort of way, even when your driving skill is near maxed out. Why they would even bother with a Driving skill, when the only time you'll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races, or mainly, to travel really far distances on the islands, is beyond me. But the other reason you won't be in a car much, is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game. According to the in-game ""Jukebox,"" there are over 100 songs in this game, and all of them are really bad, third party techno tracks. Like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in Europe. The game IS partially European, at least, which is why things are referred to in the game as a ""centre"" or a ""lift."" It's odd considering that the game takes place in the near-future West Coast America and that other things like measurements (pounds, height in feet and inches, miles per hour) are North American standard, and not Metric. Anyway, the soundtrack is really European, really Techno, and really, really bad. Maybe they figured Techno music is ""futuristic?"" It doesn't matter anyway, because they could've saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs (which you can't cut off, by the way) for the car that you'll rarely be using, anyway. At least it's nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour you're driving, though, as you accidently plow into an idiot civilian.

Strength is another almost utterly useless attribute. It's only effectiveness is raising your health. But to level it up, you'll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks, which is even more rarely used than a vehicle. 99.9% of the game is shooting, and you can only really raise your strength (health) by whacking an enemy with a gun, or kicking them, which does very little damage to them, anyway. You see, some of your skills are raised per usage. Meaning, the more you shoot, the more you blow stuff up, and the more you win races, the higher your stats will go, with 400 points being the maximum effectiveness level (even though the bar will continue to go up to 500.) But you'll almost never kick or hit an enemy, so raising this stat is pretty annoying.

The other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs. Literally hundreds of orbs, scattered across literally every rooftop in the game, is how you increase your Agility. You don't have to collect all 500 of them to max out your Agility though, because of the rooftop races (although you really won't win those much) and the blue, ""Hidden orbs"" which increase a little of every stat. In fact, those were the only way I was able to get Driving and Strength skills up. The driving is bad, no matter what, though, and the Strength, although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons, is only useful for health. I had about 300/500 Agility orbs and 100/300 Hidden orbs, by the time I finished the game, and only Driving was lower than Level 2 (300 to 399 points).

The shooting in this game, though, is severely flawed. And not because of the weak Firearms skills and weak firearms in the game. But by the Auto-Aim targeting being severely broken. I swear, this auto-aiming NEVER EVER EVER works the way you want it to. It sems to target only the most furthest enemies, or moving non-enemies first, and ONLY focuses on the guy right in your face when there's absolutely nothing left to kill. While the game does give you manual shooting as well, it's pretty hard to kill anything that's not close up to you with it. But the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that you'll never even see until you're already dead are the two biggest things that'll kill you the most with this game. And unless you really get into this crapfest of a game, you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times. I only had it on normal difficulity, and I died like 30 times within any given hour.

All the guns are pretty weak, and when I found it, about late into the first gang and location, I wound up using the Harrington HMG 90 rifle throughout the remainder of the game. You only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game, by the way. The problem with all of the serious firearms is that they're power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times, with the Harrington being the slowest. I counted the reload time of this thing. Six seconds. Now picture that. In the heat of warfare, having to spend SIX whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun! Count to six and that's how much time you're waiting inbetween fire. In six seconds, you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload. And yes, being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game, I tried the Call of Duty style ""switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading"" tactic, only for that to not work as the stupid generic character you're using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out, so in order for the Call of Duty trick to work, I'd have to watch and make sure I don't go below ten bullets left and THEN, switch to the other gun in order for it to work, as the character's auto-reloading is completely and totally un-interruptable. SO annoying! WHY should a player have to endure crap like this? Throughout the whole game, I either used the Harrington despite it's insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher, as anything else would be ineffective, have too small of a clip, hold too little of maximum ammo, or simply be just too weak. Sounds fun, doesn't it?

The ""characters"" in this game aren't even characters. There's you, the generic, namelss ""agent."" (Maybe ""Agent"" is your actual name. I don't know.) There's the disembodied commander narrator/boss guy, who'll remark such sayings as, ""Go like the wind, agent!"" and ""Simply pathetic."" when you die. Having the game insult you every time you die, and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw, is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny, little pieces. The ""bad guys"" are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever. It's like they looked in an LA phone book to get names for the Spanish lieutenants. There are three ""gangs"" that rule the city, but they're more like criminal empires because street gangs don't have that many soldiers and they don't actually run entire sectors of a city and it's inhabitants. They are  ""Los Muertos"" or ""The Dead"" (pretty clever, eh?), The Volk, and Shai Gen. Or... ""Generic Spanish gang,"" ""Generic Russian gang,"" and ""Generic Chinese Corporation gang.""

The key members of the gang, like I said, are about as generic-looking as generic can get and when you actually find out where they're located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them, you'll be rewarded with nothing, in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success. You see, the game developers thought that it'd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more ""fun"" by taking out key lieutenants, who each enhance the criminal empire, be it by firearms, number of soldiers available, vehicles, etc., so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader. But even WHEN you kill everyone else and save him for last, it's STILL virtually impossible, between the miles long approach to their headquarters, the endless spawning soldiers, and the enemy's eight life bars. Like most strongholds in the game, you're best to just run past everyone, trying to survive, and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you. Screw ""weaking their health"" or ""minimizing their recruits"" with killing the lieutenants, because they won't do much help for you, regardless. But then, I guess, the game would be too short. In this case though, that'd be a good thing.

I should also bring up that the map is even messed up. Yes, that's right! Even the MAP is a pain in the donkey. Not only is the map horribly out-of-scale with everything else, and not only does the map not provide you with any GPS or waypoint marking, but you CAN'T EVEN ZOOM IT IN! The map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen. You can't zoom it in to see closer, or anything. And the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality, meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you! How often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of it's many, many flaws? Okay, so you can't zoom in, use a GPS, or even accurately know where you're at. Surely, the HUD ""radar"" map must be better, right? Nope. The biggest problem is, unlike ANY other game that uses an on-screen map, there's no ""N"" for ""North."" Just four arrows, any one of them could possibly be north. There's a reason why they don't put the ""S""outh, ""E""ast, and ""W""est on these, and this is why. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING! I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the game just to figure out which way was North. I often had to look one direction, pause to see the full map to see where I'm facing on it, and then, turn again until I got to facing North or where ever it is I had to go. How could they not have even gotten this right? It also would've been helpful if, being you spend most the game on the roof, to know which enemies were eye-to-eye level with me, above me, or below me. Usually, they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps, and all things below facing down. But, oh no, not in this game! I died so many times because I couldn't tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above, from below, or from so far away, they wouldn't even show up in the compass map screen. Every single enemy is just a dot. Even if they're above me or below me. It's things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given Grand Theft Auto title, where you don't have to try to figure out where North is, and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at. But not in this game! In fact, I've seen an effective map system in about EVERY Xbox 360 game that uses one, EXCEPT this game! Oh, and you can't even zoom the map in. Ins't that just something else?

When you die, you have to restart from a ""supply station,"" most of which are few are isolated between locations, and all of them have to be found and unlocked. Oh, and they're ALL on roofs, meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them, and you could die just trying to get down from them! An elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time would've been nice. I mean, they actually HAVE them in the game and all, so it's not like they would've had to make one from scratch or anything. Any good gun you collect from an enemy HAS to be taken to this supply center/save point in order for you to keep it, or else, you'll lose everything you collected once you die. Sometimes, because of the random enemy pop ups, you'll, ironically, die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die. You could be at any given rooftop, look one way, then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you. Sometimes, you can even see them materialize in front of you. Sometimes, you'll restart at a save point and by chance, there'll be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead. I don't know. Maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun, but it's really not. Neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade. You can still die by gravity, by the way, so with each roof, you still have to be very careful.

The only good thing I can say about the game is that there's no glitches. Oh, wait. There are! Like, constantly getting stuck in a wall, or a rampway, or even the ground! Stuck as in, ""this solid object isn't all that solid"" stuck. And the random enemies. That counts, too. It's bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area, the game will have a ""hit squad"" of about ten cars come up and bring MORE enemies to you, but to have the ones you JUST KILLED re-materialize right in front of you is just insulting. Like, why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you, and the dead ones simply return back like it's nothing? Your character is a genetic clone and ""The Agency"" can make an endless supply of you in case you die. What's their excuse, though?

Overall, this kind of pointless 3D ""shoot and jump"" kind of simplistic game wouldn't have been so bad on the N64, the original Playstation, or even as an early Gamecube title. I mean, the comic-book like art style isn't anything impressive or new or advanced. 1999 to 2002, this game might've been acceptable. An ""average"" game, at best. But this kind of simple, pointless, storyline-less, linear ""shoot and kill just for the sake of it"" game is far below what today's standards are in gaming. To imagine that this is an Xbox 360 title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development, that it's heavily outdated by today's standards. When you can't even tell which way is North on your compass map, you can't even zoom in your menu-guide map, and every single character is as generic as a white and black-text can of government corn, it really isn't a game ready to be released. At least not in any year past 2003, on any system greater than maybe Gamecube. This game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just, really frustrating and lame and incomplete. I can't give this game a One because other than the ""getting stuck"" and ""targeting,"" there really aren't any glitches or bugs in it. The game is somewhat playable.

However, when a game makes you want to break something in it's incompleteness, or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the 219th time, something ain't right. I can't imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game, not to insult anyone under thirteen, but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic. By the cover and art style, the game looks kind of cool. You sort of think ""Gears Of War"" combined with ""Saint's Row."" You get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city. Sounds fun. And I'm sure, most people who bought this game bought it for the Halo 3 beta, but also because it looked or sounded like fun, right? However, I haven't played a game THIS bad since ""Sonic Heroes."" (and I would include every other Sonic game since then, had I actually played those also-poorly-rated titles) This is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands, or sell to any gaming store, even if you can only get $2.95 for it. Shoot, ANY amount of money the guy offers you at a game store, you'll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore. I can't say it's a Legend in the ""Worst Games Of All Time"" ranking, but it's definitely one of those games you'll get rid of, by any means possible, just to not have in your collection. It's like the DVD of ""Gigli"" or ""I Know Who Killed Me"" in your DVD collection that makes everything else you own, as well as yourself, look bad just by it's mere prescence, so you get rid of it, possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too, and pretend like it never happened. Yes, this game is a ""pretend like it never happened"" kind of game.

B00GMFKYK8,2.0,"I honestly didn't like this game from the get go, it just didn't grab me. But I probably would have stuck with it if it wasn't so unfairly hard.  I loved the challenge in Bloodborne, but there are so many cheap deaths in this game that it crushed any desire I had to play it. The game drops you off with no chance to practice and get good. Each time you get killed, the enemies spawn as stronger versions of themselves and after a while you are overwhelmed by too many overly strong enemies.

If you have any semblance of a life outside of video games, this will get irritating VERY quickly and you will give up in frustration.
Lots of people like this game, so maybe you will to but I suggest that you rent it before you buy it.","Too hard to be fun, too clunky to be worth your time practicing"
B003O6EAM6,2.0,"I don't know why I allow myself each year to fall for the same garbage from EA. Each year they tell us the game is improved but usually it is nothing more than a glorified roster update. But it seems that the more time goes by without any competition for EA Madden continues to go down hill and this arcade game is the proof. They made a game that couldn't be further from the actual game itself. It's more of an arcade game than a simulation football game with real flow or connection to actual football. I've been playing madden since the early 90's and I played actual football at a semi pro level so I actually know the ins and outs of the game and let me tell you this game couldn't be further away from the real thing. And it is possible to make games look and feel life like and you don't have to look further than EA's fifa 12 and you'll see a much better finished product. You can clearly tell that they put a lot more time and effort into that game because they have a lot of competition so they cant sleep on the game like they do Madden.

Pros

Lighting and weather looks good and they finally improved online match making so you can actually play people online now...

Cons

Gameplay - Only word I can use to describe is childish... No longer about skill but who can find the best cheat blitz and unstoppable plays... Skill has been totally removed from the game itself.

Game speed - Michael Vick was caught from behind by a 350 pound lineman and Vick was running flat out but could not beat the guy to the corner... It feels like they're always running in the mud and speed is totally irrelevant and there is absolutely zero flow to the game you can basically only move straight ahead or diagonally so side stepping or ""juking"" is a total thing of the past.

Graphics are ok for a cartoon-ish looking arcade game but nothing about the game looks life like including players faces and bodies or movements or playing styles or reactions you name it, couldn't be further from the actual NFL.

Overall I gave the game 2 starts only because its football and nothing else. Stay away from this one and hopefully if enough people do stay away EA will either lose their exclusive rights to the NFL or start to make the game more realistic and less child's play.

PS, if you want the best sports simulation game with the best graphics and game play get anything 2K sports. NBA 2k12 will be one of the best selling sports games of all time and one of if not the best basketball game ever.",New look same result... Disapointment
B00127VDVK,2.0,"The story varies from game to game, and having played all of them I still think Going Commando is the best. The comedy and emotional impact varies, but this is one of the weaker the series has to offer - I don't know if the folks at High Impact Games couldn't get any of the team from R&C's home Insomniac Studios, because while it holds the game together it's nothing spectacular and lacks the comic feel that makes other R&C games more forgivable.
Story: 6.0/10

I know this is just a port from a PSP game, but while being playable on the small screen it doesn't translate well to a larger screen, even if you can forgive ugly texturing. Graphical anomalies, jagged edges and flickering polygons happen relatively frequently. PS2 owners can rotate the camera at will by the right analog stick, but the motion is more sluggish than other R&C games.
Graphics: 4.5/10

You can only choose between stereo and mono, but at least the sound effects are acceptable. Nothing exceptional, but passable.
Sound: 6.0/10

Ratchet & Clank has generally had relatively quirky music, some more dramatic pieces in Going Commando. While nothing's specifically bad here, it's also forgettable at best.
Music: 5.0/10

Action, adventure, and platforming has always been what Ratchet & Clank is all about. This is good enough for a fix, but it's nothing specifically good. Completionists will be especially frustrated, because there are a wealth of bugs, clip errors, and registry failures and there were absolutely no fixes in porting it from PSP to PS2. One of the things that Insomniac always seemed to hit squarely was the margin for error that made it challenging but not frustrating, and High Impact Games dropped the ball there.
Gameplay: 4.5/10

I only score this aspect this highly because it has the same 'Challenge Mode' that all Ratchet & Clank games had (except Quest for Booty). You keep items and experience from one play to another, but the game gets no easier or more enjoyable for it.
Replayability: 6.0/10

I wanted to like this game, and hoped that the fact that it was ported meant that it showed enough promise to be given some extra polish and another chance. It was never given any attention beyond making it run on the larger console. The lack of smooth play or forgiving margin makes it more frustrating than fun, and I'd have to recommend the rest of the series and other adventure/platformers before this.
Overall: 4.0/10",High Impact isn't Insomniac
B0002ILS1U,2.0,"First of all I'm not some raging Halo... Xbox or PS2 fanboy. I actually own and played this game. On top of all that I'm not a ranting Gamecube fanboy either. So, on with my review...

Alright, so this is one of the worst games I have ever been foolish enough to buy... why? Well pretty much everything... I'll break it down for you...

Graphics 8/10

They look pretty good... but they are far from realistic, they have a very bright feel... not that dark, imersive feel that should be there. They are nicly detailed but I noticed when scanning stuff with your visor it's pixalized... and it's very noticable.

Sound 5/10

There is nothing special here at all. You got your standard monster-like sounds... nothing that made my jaw drop... oh and ProLocic II is there too.

Controls 1/10

This has to be the worst aspect of the game. WHY THE CLASSIC CONTROL SYSTEM!? By that I mean that you move with only one stick... oh this is f*****g annoying. It is impossible to simply turn the damn character... and to move around the 'beautiful' levels with any sort of ease. This is especially annoying in battle, it's fine when you actually lock onto the enemy but it's hard to just turn toward the enemy unless you go into... uh free aim mode (by pressing R) but you turn so damn slow that by the time your turner around the enemy has moved to another side of the arena. The should've switched to precision controls (or at least gave you the option to) which would've made the game worlds better. Other than that major flaw the controls are acceptable.

Actual Gameplay 3/10 (this should cover everything else)

Ok, so you have like 5 different weapons to pick from... which all look similar. So anyway, you travel through the SAME world the whole game shooting everything that moves and solving pointless puzzles... with the occasional, challenging boss battles. Ahh past all that comes another thing that annoys the living hell outta me is savepoints... where are they? There is a serious lack of save points in this crappy game. Worst or all when you die after a boss fight you can't simply restart the fight... nooooo you have to revert back to your last save point which is usually very long before that fight. If you wanna learn more about what you actually do read a fanboy review or a Gamespot review.

If by some chance you have been stuck in a bomb shelter for the past few years and missed this one and you're in the market for a 360 Halo game, get Reach instead - it ain't perfect either, but it's the best of the bunch.  At the very least, wait it out and get the HD remake of the original game - you'll get the security of having a brand new multi-player.

Not only that, but everything in it seems like it was hastily done, with little effort. Most of the content is direct rip offs of Final Fantasy XIV content. Rieves are FATE battles, maps are copy/paste like skirmish in XIV, the daily quests are essentially guild leves, and the storyline is barely even there.

I understand not having an expansion totally done to allow for future updates, but this isn't even close to that point. The new classes are pretty fun to play as, but I feel like outside of that, I paid $30 to light up a tag on the log in screen.

Square, we know you're trying to focus your effort on XIV, but please focus on XI a little more too. This isn't Square-Enix quality; or is it nowadays?

Might update after future patches.",Unfinished expansion once again.
B000F1UK3Q,2.0,"Where to begin?  Let me start by saying that ever since we were treated to ET on Atari, with rare exception, movie-based games have generally been pretty awful.  The reason for that is simple, a developer knows that a product's name will entitle it to a certain number of sales just because of the name.  There's no ""extra-incentive"" for you to inflate the budget of a product if you don't expect to recoup that dollar amount in sales.  'Superman Returns', I really thought, wasn't going to fall into that developer trend.

My expectations were raised, oddly enough, when the game was delayed and the demo was released.  'Superman' was originally supposed to come out in May of '06 to coincide with the release of the feature film.  When it was delayed, I mistakenly thought that was the staff at EA saying to itself, ""OK, there's more interest here then we thought, lets sink a little more time and effort into this one.""  The game was subsequently pushed to November to match up with the film's DVD release.  Then the demo for the game hit xBox live and I was legitimately impressed.  Metropolis was huge, the environment was interactive, the flight mechanics were solid; it reminded me of 'Ultimate Spider-Man', just with Superman.  The graphics and the combat system were a little below-average, but I wrote that off as a problem they're working on.  It was just a demo after all, I expected it to be a little rough around the edges.

While nothing that I enjoyed about the game was changed, I'm disappointed to say that none of these issues I had were fixed for the game's final release either.  Not to mention, there's very little to the game outside of the demo I played.  Instead of using the extra time EA took to get 'Superman' released to add content, EA seemed to just seem to multiply what was there already.  Just for example, there isn't enough diversity in the enemies Superman will confront.  You fight Metallo and his minions fairly early in the game.  You'll be fighting those same annoying robots the whole game.  There are only about five or six actual boss fights in the game, none of whom I found particularly difficult.  One of which is the same character twice!  I'd have loved to have seen more of Supe's rogues gallery.

There aren't many side missions you have to distract yourself with either.  It would have been awesome to involve more of Superman's supporting cast to pass along side objectives.  As I said before, there's not more diversity, it's as if they just doubled what was already there.

As far as the previous 'Superman' games go, this is definitely king of the hill.  Some of those games were flat-out awful, this is at least playable.  It's just that I wish they took the nugget of a good thing they had going and fleshed it out a lot more.  For now, it's nothing more then a ""... could of been.""

B00005TNI6,2.0,"This may shock you but I really don't think this game is the classic everyone say's it is.

The Good:
The ability to tag your party members in and out is really neat.
The summons actually stay and fight instead of attacking once and going away. ( i was amazed by this the first time i played it.)
there is some exploration and hidden eons at end game.

The Bad:
Everyone is really good at killing a certain kind of monster, turning random battles into rock paper scissors. Tidus for the lizards, Auron for the shells, Lulu for the Elementals, Rikku for machines, ect. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't SO prominent. You will literally go through most of the game one-shotting anything that isn't a boss monster, and don't even get me started on stone-touch weapons...

The voice acting is cringe worthy.
Most of the game is a linier to the point most of the game world feels like a giant hallway.
The Other characters are infinitely more interesting than Tidus. (Which is bad because he's narrating the story.)
The blitzball.
The plotholes.

The meh:
The art style will either be hilariously camp or jarring to the point it takes you out of the story, or both.

If you like this game, then good for you.

B00D7NQP9M,2.0,"Paid full release price for this, which I rarely do, and this game reminded me why.

For the first few hours it's a lot of fun, but then you realize it's really just not a great game. basically every class has AoE's and you just walk around and AoE spam into crowds of mobs. Eh. Not much fun. I think I got 10 or so hours in, right near the end of the game and haven't picked it up since. Get this as cheaply as possible, or rent over a weekend from GameFly.

B00C27SCC2,2.0,"Thief was a game I never played in previous incarnations and had heard many good things about. Many have said Thief gave rise to Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed and Metal Gear.
Some of those games that it gave rise to, I wish that Thief would have also taken notes from them.

Don't get me wrong, it's not an entire mess of a game but for all the hype especially as one of the first games to arrive post next-gen launch it fell short of what I was expecting.

The story itself is a bit muddy as somehow the main protagonist Garrett working alongside his protg Erin end up at a mansion with some shadowy cult opening up a gateway in which Erin falls through and is presumably killed.  Garrett wakes up later and apparently has new thieving powers (a'la Batman's Detective mode) to help him traverse his terrain.  So it's up to Garrett to solve the mystery of the cult ad find out what happened to Erin.

What is interesting is that this game plays almost like the thieving version of Skyrim.  If it isn't bolted down, take it and for everything you steal you automatically get credits towards upgrading your skills and weapons which would be fine, but Garrett is supposed to be a master thief so why is the game predicated on you being a petty thief and stealing everything?  One aspect I do like about the game which I wish more games of this genre would do is how it goes about dealing with light sources.  Garrett works best in the dark and in certain areas, Garrett has the ability to extinguish light sources with sometimes a simple switch or blowing the lights out or something more elaborate such as a water arrow.  While dousing some of these lights in the game is great there is still the questionable AI that I have a problem with.  A few times I have used a water arrow to only have the AI make a note of it via voice dialogue but not move to re-light it.  On other occasions, I have put lights out using other methods and the AI comes running along to light it right back up.  It's just very inconsistent on how this is done.

One of biggest issues I had early on was I was stealing a mask in a house and was trying to make my way out and the house was pretty dark except for a woman reading a book with a guard stationed outside of her room.  I wanted to distract her to steal something else and just for the hell of it, I threw a bottle on the other side of the room which broke, very loudly.  To that, she only commented about who is there and the guard woke up and then dozed back off.  REALLY???!!???  So nobody is going to investigate a shattered bottle on the other side of the room in a dark house??  Ok then.

Other issues I have had are with the controls.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  Lock-picking is a straightforward method that is reminiscent of Skyrim which works great.  But sometimes walking to a box or a drawer to open it for pilfering doesn't always work.  Sometimes if you aren't positioned `just so', you can't get the item.  Sometimes I have to double press the button just to get it to work.

Combat is another issue with this game as this is one thing that Eidos didn't steal (pun intended) from Skyrim.  Garrett can barely manage his own against one opponent but the second he gets ganged up on, it's over.  And because he has this `do not kill' philosophy, swords are out and most of his opponents are packing to kill so my advice is if you alert too many guards, just run.  I will say this however, if you die, the save points are generous in placing you where you left off.

Another issue is that unlike more modern games like Assassins Creed, there aren't many places for you to climb and you don't have that freedom to maneuver like you would in other games and the play-map is a mixed bag but at least you have the option of a guide-point on your HUD to direct you to your next location.  One thing that I heard complaints about was the constant loading the game has to do when you go from location to location.  I am fine with this actually as sometimes I have hated to have to travel from one point in a town to another like in Assassins Creed. BUT, the load times can take a while.  It's not game breaking but it's worrying.

Graphically, Thief is really a mixed bag on the PS4.  Some of the cutscenes tend to stutter and for many of the characters in game, their facial models look very last gen especially Erin.  This was probably one of the things that dropped my expectations the most.  The City itself however looks really good at some points with the hi-res treatment that it got but I do wish that there was some kind of day/night cycle even if it was early morning and sunset and not just dark all of the time. Some of the light sources and water sources are good but if that is all going on for it graphically, then why bother?  For this to be a AAA title, I was expecting so much more in this game graphically.

So is there anything likeable about this game?  The stealth aspects are cool as advertised; you can approach a mission in multiple ways.  So far I have tried completing levels with as very little contact as possible and so far I have done ok in doing it.  There is a ton of stuff to find if you have patience and a lot of side missions to do.  This game will hold me over for a short time at least until Titanfall comes out in a few weeks.",Thief should have stolen more from other games

B000JJI4Z0,2.0,"I tried playing Final Fantasy XI a few times since it came out for PC (2003, maybe?) and I had to move on.  The first time through, things really slowed down around level 18.  You need to do a very annoying quest to get your ""subjob,"" otherwise you're useless in parties.  Also, around level 20, you make a crazy long and dangerous journey to a big city to get your chocobo, which involves you sitting down at your computer for 5 to 6 hours!  The game gets so ridiculous with the time required to do anything...  And you can forget about going ""solo.""  Quests didn't yield any experience points so your only way to level was to fight.  Once you hit levels 10 through 12, doing that by yourself becomes extremely lengthy and tedious.  Monsters that seem like a ""decent challenge"" will really mess you up...  Fighters can take hits, but can't cure poison.  Mages can do a lot of damage, but spells take time to cast and get interrupted.  Red mages almost cut it, but don't have a lot of hit points...  In short, if you don't have a good party, your experience points per hour will be terribly low.

The second time I played the game, last summer (it's 3/23/07 right now), there weren't enough people playing to even make parties!  There were only about 2k people logged on to my server period.  Before, there were nearly that many within shouting distance.

I went to World of Warcraft.  It's possible to get things done in shorter periods of time, and not nearly as dependent on partying with others.  Ultimately, FFXI had some good ideas, but World of Warcraft pretty much fixed all the problems I had with FFXI.",Moved on to World of Warcraft
B00109KMOO,2.0,"Legendary is one of those games that seems like it was created for me.  It combines fantasy monsters and lots of guns to create a modern-day first-person shooter that takes on the creatures of Greek myth.

Wait, did I say Greek myth?  Where did you get that idea?  Oh, probably from the notion that Charles Deckard opens Pandora's Box (which is, you know, Greek) and unleashes: griffons, minotaurs, werewolves, firedrakes, Nari (evil little pixies), Tscuhigomo's Children (spiders that explode), a golem, a kraken, and poltergeists. Minotaurs and griffons make perfect sense. You could make an argument that the myth of Lycaeon places werewolves in Greek mythology. The firedrakes are modeled after the mythical salamander, a myth that harkens all the way back to the Talmud. But the rest? The rest is an excuse to throw monsters at you to blow up.

My delicate historical sensibility aside, Legendary is still a peculiar beast. Deckard's supposedly a jewel thief, but his lock-picking skill consists of standing at electrical panels and waiting for a counter to finish so the door opens.  It seems like there was supposed to be a lock-picking mini-game that didn't make it into the finished product.

Deckard also has the ability to absorb energy from every monster he kills.  This allows him to heal, shoot a burst of energy at his opponents, and power certain gadgets to defeat bigger monsters like the golem and the kraken. Reminiscent of Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, this ""kill more to survive"" game mechanic is only slightly less forgiving.

Every game has a developer's favorite monster, the one that the designers clearly put a lot of thought into, sometimes to the exclusion of the actual focus of the game.  In F.E.A.R. it was the amazingly life-like, intelligent, and vulgar clone soldiers.  In Legendary, it's the werewolves.  They climb, they throw stuff from afar, they regenerate unless you chop their heads off, and they're hideous-looking. You will learn to hate werewolves with a passion in Legendary.

What's curious about Legendary is that it wants to be a horror game.  There are several scenes wherein everyday citizens are torn apart by the supernatural horrors unleashed by Pandora's box, right before your very eyes.  Which seems a bit out of place for a game about mythical creatures taking over the world.  Given the range of monstrosities foisted on thus in most modern horror games, a man being eaten by an eagle/lion isn't all that scary.

Legendary is pretty linear too.  You can only shoot the bad guys you're allowed to shoot (no putting those civilians out of their misery!). You can only go in the designated areas not blocked off by debris, which is everywhere of course. And you can't jump. Period.

The ending has to be the most hilarious, over-the-top, death scene of a villain ever.  Assuming you even make it to the end (spoiler alert!), you will have the distinct pleasure of watching the main villain killed in a Rube Goldberg-ian game of monster volleyball, with each monster mangling and then tossing the bad guy off to the next until he it tossed over a ledge...and then bounces on the way down!

This isn't a bad first-person shooter, merely a mediocre one trying to compete with superior action horror titles.",Hardly legendary
B00503E8S2,2.0,"I have been a Halo and Gears player for years and just recently purchased Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3. Both are a different type of gameplay than what I am accustomed to, but both do have their pros and cons. Even though this is a MW3 review I will incorporate BF3 into it as well just for comparison, as I believe BF3 is more similar to MW3 than Halo. I am reviewing this game from a technical perspective, not so much from gameplay. Everyone is different when it comes to what they like, so my preference should not be a factor. However, if you are an avid Halo and Gears player then our taste could be similar.
  First off, I am only addressing the online play. I owned the original MW and did not like it for the unlimited spawning of enemies, so I never bothered to buy any of the subsequent titles; from what I have read this is still the formula for campaign.  Many of the previous reviews are upset with the lack of evolution from MW2; I will not be able to comment on that. I find the graphics and the sound par with other Xbox games that have come out recently. I do think that BF3 does look better with the optional texture pack installed. Either way with the fast action of both games it is really hard to stop and look around.
  The multiplayer gameplay is very fast-paced. I believe it gives enough options for someone to choose what they would like to play. I really like the custom upgrade system where you choose your own path. BF3 has an upgrade system, but it is based on a pre-defined technology tree.  I am very big into objective based games and teamwork, MW3 has added elements to encourage this type of play, but it still seems it is all about the K/D. Oddly, BF3 rewards more for objectives, but makes it easier for campers.  The MW3 servers appear to run smoothly and I have not encountered any problems. Sadly, the BF3 servers still have many issues, which make it very frustrating to play with friends in a squad. MW3 is a smoother experience in this aspect. However, the MW3 Elite service is horrid and still not functioning today. Battlelog for BF3 is fully functioning and I have not encountered problems checking my stats since launch.
  Overall, I would give the multiplayer part of the game 4 stars, based on ease of operation, graphics and sound. I marked off an additional two stars for the $49.99 price on the elite service, because this is integrated into the game and has been heavily marketed. Personally, I think this is just a way to fleece gamers' money. Sadly, Elite does not even work at this time. Unless, they guarantee a set amount of DLC, $49.99 on top of $59.99 game price is unacceptable. With that being said, the elite service is good for one year from date of purchase, so it is in everyone's benefit to purchase just before the release day of the first DLC to maximize length of service or when it is fully functioning.  I believe the amount of DLC will be dependent on the amount of people who shell over the additional $49.99. I have not seen any game rack up a year of DLC totaling $50 yet.
  In the end, I find the game frustrating and to fast for my taste, and not worth the $59.99 price plus an additional $49.99. I like to buy DLC on my terms, sometimes I get it all, and sometimes I just get the first offering. I am going to opt out of the $49.99 elite service and just hope the free stat-tracking portion is operational soon.
  If I had to pick between MW3 and BF3, I would pick BF3. They each offer a different experience. MW3 allows more character and class customization and can easily be played solo. BF3 has planes, tanks, helicopters, larger maps and offers more points for completing objectives, but is frustrating if you do not have a good squad-better played with friends. MW3 is just to fast-paced for me and is too dependent on kill streaks. Technically the game plays smoothly, but is just not for me.",Honest Review from Halo Gamer
B000066RKC,2.0,"I loved the film. If your a true horror fan you'll know the orignal thing was made in the 50's. As a kid I truly loved it. It was the first time I seen a horror film where it was impossible (almost impossible) to kill the monster. I believe they killed the thing with electrcity in the first one. The John Carpenter remake was awesome, much better then the first original.
The game has good graphics & real language, meaning a lot of 4 letter words. If you know anything about the military you know cursing is part of it. Try boot camp..:) But the 4 letter words were really forced. The NPC's just said them for the heck of it. I thought this game would have alot gore & Disturbing images.. It had a few but not impressivly gorey. Most is not realistic looking. Looks more like red paint drippings etc.. The game play is ok. The fear/trust factor is nice but annoying. The AI troops are pretty stupid. I asked my medic to fix & power box & he said he couldn't cause he was blocked. There was another way to get to the power box. Even when I showed him the way he resorted to his pre programed instinks & went toward the path that was blocked. I had to use a gernade to blow up the remaining boxes so he could repair it.
The guns & other items you have in the game are nice. I wish they had a more diverse collection of weapons though. They have 4 distint types of grenades. I wish they had more distint firearms. The most frustating part of the game is your freeze meter. If your body tempture gets too low you die.. You must constanty go back & forth into building to rejuvinate yourself.. This gets repetitive fast & is very tedious & boring. I found this game to be unsuspenseful in most accounts. The game does a good job of picking up the pace the middle parts & will keep your interest during the more tame beginning of the game. Not knowing who is infected is pretty cool, but lacks in suspense too, cause you know your NPC teammates are going to be infected. Thats a no brainer. There really aren't any suprises. Only a few minor ohh's & Ahh's.. If you have a weekend to kick back & relax, rent it.. Just don't expect it to be a great horror survival experience..",I was expecting more..
B00004YKI6,2.0,"Every once in a while you just go ahead and buy a game without knowing anything about it and you are sorry you did.  I have had this happen to me once before with a bad game called Deathtrap Dungeon.  Well I referred to this game as Deathtrap Dungeon 2 because it's another mistake on my part.
And believe me, I am not all that hard on games.  I want to like games and I want to have fun, but there isn't much good about this game.  First off, as the other review noted there is no story.  You start the game off right in battle, and you expect the story to pick up after that right?  Wrong.  Think a story is going to show itself at the beginning?  Wrong.  I have yet to see any story.  The only story you will get is from reading the book.
The game kind of reminds me of a Diabalo/Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, except both of those games were good, and Dark Angel is not.  If they would have just thrown in some good voice acting like in Legacy of Kain then the game would be so much better, but they didn't.
The graphics are definately subpar.  The menu screen looks like something that could have easily been done on the PS1.  Actually, the whole game looks like it could have been on the PS1.  The only part that seems above par is the sounds and music.  But there is only so many times you can hear a monster grunt, or one say ""You'll regret that"" after you wax him before that gets old.
They say this game is an Adventure/RPG.  I don't see much RPG about it.  There really isn't much freedom to wonder around.  Guess my idea of a RPG is Phantasy Star, Summoner or Final Fantasy.  On Dark Angel you point a silver cursor to one of the areas on the map then it shows brown dots go to that location.  There is no getting attacked on your way to anything.  Then all you do is crawl around level after level of some dungeon killing lots of monsters, picking up weapons or stuff, hitting switches, and sometimes killing some monster that gives you some item to fullfill a quest you got from one of the towns.  Then you take the item back to the town and they give you some money.  You also can collect items to take to these shrine things in the towns and they can raise your strength or one of your other attributes.
The towns are pretty bad too.  There is very few people in each town, and probably only two of them are of any use to you.  Meaning, there are probably only two of them that you can get a quest from and buy and sell items.
I see nothing original or good about the game (besides the sound).  And unless you really like just mind numbing dungeon crawling, then I can't really recommend this game to anyone.  I can see this game coming down in price real quick because once some people get the word out about how bad it is, people probably won't be buying it too much.
Please rent this game if you really feel the need to play it.  Then decide whether or not to buy it, I have a feeling that after a few hours of playing it, you won't want to waste your money on it.
Believe me, I wanted to like this game.  I really wanted it to be good, but it just isn't.  Please don't make the mistake I did and buy this game because you think it's going to be good, it just isn't.",Oops!  Made a mistake buying this one.

B001B5BRZK,2.0,"Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches
PC

I just finished this Welsh point-and-click adventure game. You find yourself in a desolate farmhouse in Wales and get to investigate strange ghost-demon related activity there. Let's begin with the fact that it was fun at some times and some of the puzzles were enjoyable. Some moments of the story, too. On the other hand, many of the puzzles were very typical (find a light bulb to enter an unlit room etc.), some of the puzzles were randomly stupid. Many of the parts of the storyline are boring and they feel really random and illogical.

The game was made in 2008, but it feels like 1997. Graphics is OK at times, but most of the time it feels like a high school project, same goes with animation (but there isn't much of that). Music is almost non existant and when it's there, it feels like MIDI made by a single person over a weekend...

Rhiannon was made by a three person development team with Wintermute - freeware amateur software for creating point-and-click games. I got it in a game bundle, but I wouldn't recommend paying more than $1 for this game.

Also, there are bugs. Sometimes inventory items disappear. Sometimes menu buttons (MAP) disappear. If you save afterwards, you'll never get them back. It is a known and never corrected issue.

To sum up: if you ever played a point-and-click adventure game, you probably won't enjoy Rhiannon. If you haven't, you may enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it though.

The details are incredible: the fine grain of the wood, individual hairs on the characters' heads or the leaves on a tree branch. In addition the colors were rich and vibrant. I was really encouraged by the graphics and the storyline for the first half of the game: A wealthy Englishman is murdered in front of a hundred witnesses at a party being held for his daughter with whom he has been estranged. In fact, the initial suspect is his daughter. In typical adventure gameplay you, as Sherlock Holmes (and occasionally Watson), wander throughout the deceased's house and other locations collecting and examining clues and interviewing witnesses. While collecting evidence Holmes encounters a number of puzzles.

One puzzle involves placing numbered pieces on board resembling a chessboard so that each column and row of numbers adds up to the same total - very logical and easy (although time consuming) game. Another puzzle involves placing animal statues into ""Noah's Ark"" in the correct order. This is a more difficult puzzle and requires examining a few clues for the answer. However, two other puzzles (a card game and the combination to a safe) made no sense to me even after consulting a walkthrough. But even that wasn't as bad as the puzzles that occur during the second half of the game.

These are timed puzzles. For the first puzzle Holmes has to get from one location to another without being caught by a guard and a watch dog. One problem with the puzzle is that the characters of Holmes, the dog and the guard are only about the size of a gnat, making them almost impossible to distinguish. Another problem was that I could not figure out where Holmes was supposed end up. The only way I could figure out this puzzle was with a walkthrough along with a whole lot of persistence. It had to have taken me a dozen or more attempts to get Holmes where he needed to go without being detected. I found this so frustrating and it made me so angry that the rest of the game was ruined for me. After all, adventure games are supposed to be fun - not make you want to throw your computer out the window (instead I threw my mouse across the room). But wait - once you get Holmes to his destination successfully, and he is done there, there's a similar timed puzzle to get him to a second location without detection.

Then, just as you think (and hope) that this was the last of the timed puzzles, you're stuck with another one. In this puzzle, Holmes goes through a maze set in a forest and then needs to retrace his steps to fetch a pail of water to put out a fire. This wouldn't have been too bad except that Holmes can be very difficult to manipulate at times. Theoretically, the player should just half to click on an icon (a set of footprints) to get Holmes to move. Unfortunately, Holmes doesn't always move when this icon is clicked or the icon doesn't appear at all (or is difficult to locate - a couple of times it is located on Holmes's body). This makes moving Holmes quickly through a maze very frustrating. It took me another dozen or more attempts to accomplish this task (this time I only screamed obscentities at my computer). Even though I was mad, frustrated and disappointed I had to finish the game to find out who the killers are (a few more bodies pile up during the game). Once all the clues are gathered it is time for Holmes to reveal the killers. But instead of a nice tight conclusion Holmes rambles on for at least fifteen minutes - the answer was so convoluted and contrived that I lost interest - even taking a bathroom break, only to come back to find Holmes still going on and on and on.

This is a game I was really looking forward to. The first half of the game was very promising but then it took a dramatic turn for the worse - I cannot recommend it.",Complete disappointment
B00008RUYX,2.0,"EA has demonstrated the ability to master a sport when they put effort into it (NCAA Football, Madden, NASCAR Thunder, FIFA). So it's appalling (but probably financially successful) to see them slap out half-hearted efforts like F1 Career Challenge, Knockout Kings and the NHL and NBA series because they know they can cut costs and production because the hardcore fans will ensure a profit alone.
Similar to the NHL series, they add a few gimicky features to appeal to the console crowd but take away more specialized features like adjustable AI, car tuning, race length and individual stats. The graphics are slightly upgraded, but the framerate, draw distance and control are poor. The engine sounds actually cut out when you turn the wheel!
It's clear EA used old code and slapped together some poor cutscenes with bland presentation (which is an EA strength). It's like a bad expansion pack for F1 2002.
The worst new features include a ""hot zone"" where you score EA cards and points for driving fast through a designated portion of the track. The screen gradually turns red the faster you go (think of the ""bluring effect"" in the horrible movie ""Driven""). And various EA cards pop up and distract you on screen when you overtake and take corners properly. Very distracting and childish. Console racers will never compete with PC sims, but at least give us the option to try.
The big career mode is a joke as you virtually have no customization options. Race length, damage, AI and even pit strategy are all set. You cannot even determine a tire compound!!
My recommendation is to get ""Grand Prix Challenge."" It is probably the best F1 racer ever to hit a console and it has terrific controls and graphics. Then wait and see what Sony does with the F1 license when Formula One 2003 comes out. I have a feeling they will take it very serious because of it's exclusivity and the uproar that would be caused in Europe if they screwed this up. The bottom line is EA would never treat the Madden franchise like this, so why should we tolerate it with the other sports.
Memo to EA...Loyalty is an important quality and one your customers exhibit enthusiastically to all your products. But if you cannot get better quality from all your development houses then at some point that loyalty will erode and more upstart companies will peck away at your bottom dollar. It may be 20 years from now, but this industry is fickle and your fan base is young, transitional and more acceptable to change.",A quick attempt to get more money before F1 goes to Sony
B001CXYMFS,2.0,"I have many combat flight sims and 3 brands of flight sticks to controll them with. This one dose not last as long and is not made as solid as CH products or saitek X52 sticks are made. I ordered this to use with playstation 3 most of the time and pc sims not as much. I have used it less than any of the other flight sticks I have and 1 button has just stopped working. It did not feel as good when I took it out of the box. I new I would not use it as much and got it for playststion 3 sims and games more than anything else. I used it for flight sim x on pc and thats it on pc. I did not even like it for that and went to the X52 pro for flight sim x.
I have had this for some time now but like I said it has had very little use. I only have 1 ps3 sim(apache)I use it with and on pc I only used it for flight sim x a few times because it dose not have the number of controll buttons needed for sims like wing over europe or wing over vietnam and other newer flight sims like A10 warthog or lock on plat that take controllers like ch products fighter flight stick and pro throttle or saitek X52 & X52 pro.
It also dose not have the performance needed to controll the aircraft the way you need to with sims like I have listed. I may have used this controller 40 time as long as I have had it. The other brands I have listed have lasted for years with no issues and still work perfect like the day I opened them up out of the box and hooked them up. For the money you are better off to pay alittle more or alot more and get some other much better controller. This one will not last if they are all made like the one I got.
You can get a bad item at anytime and thats just how it is but most thing work or you have issues in the first few weeks of use. That way you have a chance to send it back for a refund or new one. If you are like me and do not use some things as much as others you are just out of luck when things like this happens and you have had the item some time but used it very little. This is not worth the money and I would not order another one at half the price the way they last and perform.
Think it over and order a better flight controller. This one will not last long if you use it much. I used mine very little and one button is dead as they get!!!!!",Dose not last as long as other products do!!!
B000KS8J00,2.0,"I decided to pick up the Wii's bust-a-move bash, here's a quick review of the pros and cons. It offers some new control layouts, thanks to the wiimote. Most importantly, the controls work well and enhance the gameplay. The gameplay is the usual bust-a-move goodness, with some added flying saucers that offer special powers, pretty cool stuff. If you don't know the bust-a-move formula, it's an action puzzle game like tetris, where you shoot different colored bubbles upward, trying to connect 3 or more to make them disappear. It's been around for a long time, and that's because it's genuinely fun. But what i'm noticing in bust-a-move bash is how bare and empty this game feels. Even the main menu will give you an empty feeling inside, i've seen cooler menus on the nes. But the menus don't matter, it's the lack of depth to the game modes which is hurting this title. There are less then a handful of modes- the regular puzzle mode, which has tons of stages, so that's a plus. Endless mode is exactly what it sounds like, and it's always fun. Shooting mode is a super simple shooting gallery game, it really isn't very good, especially compared to the shooting games on wiiplay, wariowarez, super paper mario (all of which are vastly more enjoyable). Multiplayer is fun, but there really aren't many options to change the experience. Except for being able to determine how long you'll play against your friends, you can't really change or tweak anything, so you're left with the same experience over and over. The mutiplayer is enjoyable, don't get me wrong, it's just a bit too shallow though. You would've thought the developer could have easily added a couple extra modes, but apparently they didn't have the spare week it would have taken them. Basically to sum it up, this game is good, but it's shallow. If you're a bust-a-move fan or you want another casual game to add to your growing wii collection then go out and buy this. This is a perfect title for the wii, because it will really appeal to the non-gamers out there. For more avid gamers, you're probably better off waiting for this game to drop in price, which i'm sure will happen by years end.

Presentation - 4

If you get a 4 out of 10 on a test then your parents should spank you. This presentation pretty much sucks.

Graphics - 6

The graphics are fine considering this is bust-a-move, expect simplicity and you won't be disappointed.

Sound - 5

The music is pretty annoying, but i tend to think that about most games. May appeal to very young gamers.

Gameplay - 9

I'm gonna add a little extra umph to my gameplay score, because this really is an enjoyable experience, especially with the wiimote. Good for non-gamers too.

Lasting Appeal - 6

The gameplay itself has lots of lasting appeal, simply because it's bust-a-move. But where we should have tons of modes and options, instead we have a nearly empty desert.

OVERALL SCORE - 6.5

I would especially recommend this title for non-gamers, children, and seniors.","Good game, lacks depth"
B00JKM06HG,2.0,"The Phantom Pain is far and away the weakest entry of the main numbered games in the highly lauded Metal Gear Solid series. Although everything you could expect from Konami from a technical standpoint can still be found: detailed visuals, quality audio, intuitive controls, etc. the same cannot be said for the actual organization of the games mechanics. Unfortunately, too much was invested in the rather incoherent manner of how you progress, coupled with the number of assignments that are placed upon you, that it virtually saps any enjoyment of what made Metal Gear Solid the staple franchise it became.

For those who played Ground Zeroes, adjusting to the climate of The Phantom Pain should prove no difficulties at all. You select a mission and carry out its objectives, which range anywhere from retrieving an item to eliminating a target, before exiting the mission area. This game, however, adds a new twist in the form of Fulton extractions where you recover persons, equipment, and even animals by attaching self-inflating balloons to be retrieved by aircraft. There is also a buddy system where you can take help with you on missions, as well as the ability to use different modes of transportation. But whatever innovations they may have implemented are marred by the fact that the experience is basically boiled down to being one long scavenger hunt that it loses its freshness fast.

The Phantom Pain reminds me a lot of the same problems that plagued Nintendos The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. You are stationed at a main hub (here it is referred to as Mother Base) and travel to places by air and back over and over again. Every mission unnecessarily begins and ends with credits. The mission areas themselves, as well as Mother Base, are overwhelmingly huge and relatively lifeless. The environments severely lack variety and are hardly distinguishable from one another while any enemies you come across mostly serve as annoying pushovers. You also cannot make any real advancement in the game without collecting a series of resources to upgrade the base, weapons, vehicles, equipment, etc. It almost feels as if they did all this to artificially lengthen the total playing time.

No matter how diverse the objectives may be (many of which are just uninteresting to begin with), the game assaults you with too many missions, side-ops, things to collect, and categories to level up that it resorts to tedious grinding and doing the same repetitive chore-like tasks in the same repetitive-looking environments. The disjointed overall feel of the game doesnt allow the story to flesh out well either, and every character including Snake aren't given efficient means to shine. Even the prologue game, Ground Zeroes, was a far more coherent title with superior mission design despite its short length. I understand that this game went through a lot of development politics, which didn't help things at all. Even if this weren't the last of the series it would still feel like Metal Gear Solid is done.",Monotonous Grind Session V: The Funless Game

B00008XKZY,3.0,"I'm not a big fan of huge semi's, however, I've always had the fantasy of driving one, and so I've been trying to find a good trucking game for a while now. After having purchased 18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker and enjoying it, I thought that this game would be much better, but I was wrong. This game was somewhat of a disappointment to me. It was alright, but not that great. You can tell by playing this game that it seemed kind of rushed. The graphics literally reminded me of Destroy All Humans, which was another game published by the late THQ. Nothing beautiful to look at, but gets the job done. There are hardly any animations for any of the characters in the game aside from the very small cutscenes of your character getting in or out of their truck. The driving mechanics were ok, though the steering seemed a bit oversensitive at times causing your trailer to sway back and forth a lot. I would've liked to see at least some interesting cutscenes of the characters interacting with each other, but instead, all we get is an intro cutscene and that's it. There are voice overs for the characters, but they don't have any mouth animations. By this point, you can probably already tell how lazy the developers were at making this game just to have it rushed out into the market. The story mode, or ""Trial By Truckin'"" as it's called in the game revolves around Ma Jackson who owns a trucking company called Big Mutha Truckers Inc. and gives you 6 days (60 days in video game terms) to make a wad of cash and take over the company so she can retire. Most of the game consists of buying items to haul to the next town, driving to the next town, then selling those items, all while avoiding the police, bikers, racing other AI truckers and making more cash in the process. You also get the ability to upgrade your rig and draw custom logos on your trailer. The custom logos are cool, but the upgrades don't really do much to improve your truck, well at least to me they didn't. The story mode isn't too difficult, but it's very repetitive and can become very time consuming which makes it kind of boring. They also threw in some mini-games known as ""Missions"" to complete when you get bored of the 6 (60) days of traveling. These mini-games range from knocking over mail boxes, to delivering certain packages on time and other stuff of that nature, nothing too over the top exciting though. If you can't beat story mode for whatever reason or if you just want to mess around, you have a cheat option available to you where you can input words to unlock cheats such as no damage, immunity, start with 10 million dollars and the best cheat of all, playing as Evil Bob, the antagonist during the last section of the game's story mode. Most of the humor in the game isn't that great except for maybe a couple lines spoken by the shop owners. During your travel's, you'll get to select which radio station you want to listen to. You have a station for country music, one for rock music, one for techno/electronica and one for just jibber jabber, similar to chatterbox from GTA 3, only way less amusing. Like I said, as for a trucking game, I was expecting a little more. I just found this game to be fun for maybe at least 10 minutes at best, then it just got really boring and repetitive. Maybe if it would've had more variety like interactions with characters and more cutscenes, I would've enjoyed it more. Well, since knowing that I purchased this game, I'll most likely purchase Big Mutha Truckers 2 as well and write a review on it, just to complete the collection. I guess the search for the next best trucking game continues.","Ok, not great."

B001TOMQRG,3.0,"I just got this game and have played through it on single player story mode.  Can be done easily in an evening. The minimum setup you need to play this game is a microphone.  You can play this without any gaming instrument controllers.

The story mode is an artistic rendering of snippets of the Fab Four's too-short career together.  You can also just go straight to Quick Play mode and choose the songs you want, so that would be good for replay.

As I played through each chapter, I kept wondering one thing:  Where are the Beatles' greatest hits?  There were some, but the majority were their lesser-known, less-beloved songs.  Where is ""Yesterday"", a classic that will transcend time?  ""The Long and Winding Road?""  ""Fool on the Hill?""  Why are they missing?

The game does have George's greatest songs, so I guess we can thank his widow and son for allowing that.  Trying to sing his songs really brings it home what a musical genius he was.

There is a very limited amount of DLC available.  I bought ""Michelle"", which is a song I've loved all my life.

B006ZPAYGE,3.0,"I purchased this game for my kids. They seem to love it for a while.

But this open free roaming sandbox format makes it very hard for the kids to know where to go next. So after a few months, they stopped playing.

This happened with The 2nd Lego Indiana Jones and Lego Harry Potter series.

They loved the Original Lego Indiana Jones, they were able to move from one level to the next without problems. They also love the Lego Star Wars, But now days with the open game play, they never finish the game. They are more frustrated than enjoying it now.

If you have kids that are very young, maybe you will either have to commit to playing with them to help them or look for something else. I used to get the cheat codes to unlock features to make the game easier for the kids, but now there are less codes to unlock, you have to actually play to unlock somethings.

B00IAVDOS6,3.0,"I got this ridiculous attachment because I needed a way to chat with friends while playing the X1. Its really awkward and makes no sense. i don't see why they didn't just have it built in like PS4. Having to spend extra money on this just to chat using my headset really rubbed me the wrong way. Especially since its direct competition allows you to just plug in and play. Adding insult to injury, the Astro A4 headsets that I own with the 2013 Mix Amp pro doesn't even need this extra adapter. I just plug it into the controller and it works fine. In fact, Ive been told that I sound better without it plugged in. I found out that it wasn't needed when I was online with friends. I guess i had pulled the insert that goes into the controller, I didn't know it was out until I was knee deep in a game session with friends and was going to sit on the couch.

Anyway so im not rambling anymore... If you have a good high-end headset, then you don't need this. Unless you have another person playing with you on live, then i guess they could make use of it. Don't get me wrong. this adapter works fine, it just doesn't make since to have to purchase it when they could have easily submitted firmware to allow all headsets to be used with the system.

B0000C6EB4,3.0,"Overall, I would not recommend this game, though it certainly has fun parts.

The good points: Good graphics, sound, and feel. You really feel at times like you are in the middle of a huge battle. Fun and innovative scenarios, such as riding along in the back of a truck shooting at other cars. Great gun battles throughout.

The bad points: Extremely scripted, to the point of absurdity considering what is possible nowadays in video games. The makers of the game have planned out pretty much every step of the game, giving you little control of how to accomplish your objectives. It may look like you are in a big city, but you are really in a tunnel, and the game never lets you get more than a few steps away from the path it wants you to follow.

The bad guys pop out at what I would call trigger points--in other words, they don't exist until you step over some magical point, and then they are everywhere. Very annoying. This means that you can't really plan ahead or watch out for movement ahead of you, because there won't be any enemies until you reach the magical point--then they appear basically out of nowhere.

Another thing I hated was that there were a number of places where the enemies would keep coming ad infinitum until you accomplished some specific objective.

Lots of other unrealistic things too, such as the recurring theme of the exact weapon you need for some task being conveniently left in exactly the place you need it. And conversely whereas you could normally pick up weapons from dead people, there is a part in the Russian campaign where you can't pick up any weapons at all. So my biggest complaint is that the game doesn't let you choose your own strategy at all. You have to follow the script to the letter.

Of course this does not help make the game very replayable. Another thing that hurts replayability is that the enemies always appear in exactly the same places each time you play a level, so it's just a matter of memorizing their locations.

For a game that is going for a realism effect, it is suprising that it adopted some cliches such as letting the player get shot multiple times without suffering any loss of control. Another cliche is the silly medical kits you find everywhere to restore your health.

Finally, the game is very short. I finished it in a weekend, which for me is very fast.

If you just want something fun for one weekend, its pretty fun. But if you want a keeper, look elsewhere.

B0009WPZMW,3.0,"Burnout gets a lot of credit for its concept.  And, to be fair, that's credit that's deserved.  The idea of a racing game that promotes a powerful sense of speed and encourages the player to hit things (and builds itself around a somewhat realistic prosecution of the aftermath of those collisions) is a good one.  And it leaves its marks all over this game.

Why, then, am I only giving this (to read the other reviews) apparently superb game three stars?  Well, folks--that's simple.  Absolutely every wrong deicision that could have been made with respect to this game has been made, and the end result is a piece of software that has great moments, but can only be considered middling at best.

To start with, the game is about twice as long as it should be, and that's where the problems really set in.  Racing games can be occasionally frustrating.  This game is regularly, unforgivingly frustrating.  In order to effectively ""finish"" the game, you have to perfect every event (there's a LOT of events).  In the beginning, that's pretty easy to do.  Once you reach the middle, you'll probably have five or six events that you have to repeatedly try just to get close to making your perfect rating.  By the end, pretty much all of the racing events fall into that mold.  Worst offenders are the ""Burning Laps"" (time trials), where the game designers seem not only to have assigned some wild and irregular difficulty levels (some tracks you'll get on the first shot; one notable track has taken me three hours to not perfect thus far, and I believe I'm just going to give up on the game as a whole, rather than waste another minute of my life driving the same path again).

All of this, of course, could have been solved if most of the latter half of the game had been left on the drawing boards entirely.  By the time you hit the sixth or seventh rank of events, you've pretty much seen everything the game can do for you as far as race events go.  You've done the Traffic Attack scenarios (where the challenge is basically to go fast and hit cars into oncoming traffic), you've done the Road Rage scenarios (where the challenge is essentially to learn the best places on each track to perform takeouts without injuring yourself), and you've learned all the tricks you're going to learn about general racing and driving.  The additional tracks you have to grind through serve to do nothing but extend and taint the experience of what would otherwise be an enjoyable racer.

The crash events, thankfully, don't have this problem to quite the same extent.  While several of them can be ridiculously and inexplicably frustrating (you may never know why you fail sometimes to get the gold medal in an event and succeed others), that negative element of the experience is at least kept to a comparative minimum.

But the problems - the failures of execution - don't stop with the length of the game.  There are some fundamental programming errors that also plague this title; most notably, the fact that the developers saw fit to attempt to access the disk drive BEFORE saving race result data back to the user's profile.  The result, of course, is that if you have any difficulty at all reading the disc (a smudge, or, in the case of MY 360, some sort of internal defect that causes it to fail reading any game after about an hour and a half), your results will not be saved back to your profile and you will lose any progress you've made in an event.  Add that to the work-intensive, frustrating late game and you have a recipe for disaster.

Games are supposed to be fun.  For the first ten or fifteen hours with this game, I had fun.  You can have fun with it online.  But if you expect to finish this game, you're not going to have fun.  You're going to be bored, you're going to spend a lot of time memorizing and grinding, and ultimately, you're going to end up questioning why you're finishing the game in the first place.

For the price that Amazon has this title for, it's not a bad pickup if you don't have the title on any other console (if you do, you're not gaining much, as this is just a rerelease for 360 with a little bit of extra content).  Just don't expect it to be all sunshine and roses.",All the Wrong Moves

B000R39GPA,3.0,"Sigh...I'm a Star Wars fan and a gamer...it's hard on us people.

This game is okay.  Very exciting at times with an okay story going on.  Ooh, look it Darth Vader.  Ooh look a tie fighter.  Ooh look the game is over.  Yeah, the problem with the game is that it is too short.  It's not open-ended in any way that allows you to replay it really differently.  The skills sections (that allow you to customize your character as you gain experience) are...okay.  The bit of wow wears off pretty fast as all you are in essence doing is running in a tube destroying anything in your way.  Still the action-feel is well done, the graphics are awesome, and it's hard not to enjoy dispatching enemies with a light saber.

Dear Game Designers:
Gamers want to play a game for more than a week or two.  Action CAN include role-playing elements, like dialogue choices, or open-ended, optional, side missions that don't effect your main story line significantly but players can enjoy.  We want to feel that we can influence the story, even just a little.  We want to be more than button pushers.  We want to enjoy our exorbitantly expensive video games more than once.

As for The Force Unleashed, get it cheap, or even better, rent it, no, better yet, borrow it from your friend who unfortunately paid for it (I assure you he/she is done with it already), and enjoy it for what it is, a flashy action game with no depth.",a quick bit of fun
B001NJ6AWO,3.0,"So, I'm a fan of the Terminator movies and have always wondered when or if a quality Terminator game would be released.  Every single Terminator-based game that was released prior to Salvation was terrible.  When Salvation was released, it received generally poor reviews, so I held off on picking it up.  Then, in that time span waiting for new games to be released, I decided to pick it up for pennies (~$7.00).  My initial impression was ""Wow, this game isn't all that bad.""  However, as I progressed through the game, one thing was very evident: I was bored.  Why?  Because I found myself battling the same enemies over and over and over and over again.  You will basically battle five enemy types for the majority of the game: the little arial robots, the spider robots, T-600s (the humanoid robots with gatling guns), the motorcycle robots and Hunter-Killers.  After shooting the same robots to pieces so many times, it just became too repetitive and boring.

The game plays as a third-person, cover based shooter.  The controls are fine and actually work well.  The graphics are fair, although some textures seem off and the atmosphere is fairly bland overall.  The sound is ok and the voice acting is spotty - some of the characters are done very well (Blair, voiced by Mood Bloodgood, is played nicely).  Others - mainly the supporting cast - are not so great.  Lots of overacting in my opinion.  One thing that stood out and really started to annoy me was the frequent loading and the time it took to load.  The first couple of loading sequences were ok (a T-600 stares you down while you wait).  However, after a couple of hours in, it was just aggravating.

Overall, it's an average game that I can really only see hardcore Terminator fans enjoying all the way through.  My boredome kicked in around the 2 hour mark.  It's not the worst game ever - if you can pick it up for peanuts, have no other games to play and are just looking for a filler between new releases, you could do worse than Terminator: Salvation.  Actually, this game would probably be an ok choice if you're looking for something for your kid to play.  Especially if he or she is into shooters.  There is almost no bad language and no blood.  Just a thought.

PROS
 - Decent control scheme
 - It's the Terminator
 - Good for the younger kids who like shooter/action games.  No vulgarities and no blood.

CONS
 - Very repetitive
 - Frequent and long load screens

Overall: 3/5.  Average.","Wash, rinse, repeat...."

B0053BQU4G,3.0,"This is a tough review because the game is really fun, but I'm sick of the developer's changing the controls every year. It's infuriating! The Road to Wrestlemania has good storylines and I like that it's objective-based, but the problem is that even if you accomplish the objectives, a lot of them ultimately have no impact on the outcome of the match. Also, you can't explore the backstage nearly as much as you could in Smackdown vs Raw 2011, which is disappointing.

WWE Universe is basically the same as last year's game.

You can now create your own arena and share it with others by uploading it, which is cool, but seems to be the only thing they've added to the creations section. The problem with accessing creations by others is that I had a hard time getting on to the WWE server. Half the time it said the server was not available. This may have been a problem on my end, but I don't think it was.

Roster is pretty solid and variety of matches covers just about everything you see on WWE tv.

B00OBZI7BY,3.0,"Now don't be fooled by the Tetris Ultimate title to this game here, because I really don't see anything ultimate about it. Recent iterations of tetris have had graphical enhancements and new modes of play like Tetris Axis for the 3ds but to me Tetris Ultimate is a step backward. This game is very similar to the original tetris released years ago in but with colored blocks with a few modes including a newly added challenge mode. However, compared to modern standards this game is very bare bones and completely overpriced for what it gives you.

The retail price for it right now is 30 dollars and I think this is ridiculous. With the lack of originality, the game should be worth about 10 bucks. The colors are bland and reminds me of gameboy advanced era gaming graphics. It is kind of disappointing that this game is so bare bones for the price you will pay for it.

The game does support online play but sometimes, I had a very hard time even connecting with someone. On the plus side is offers download play so you can play with a friend locally who doesn't have the game.

Its worth it for a cheap price and the graphics are great, I just wish the cars didn't fish tail so much .......... also I think a few other reviewers touched on the drifting and slipstream. Its more difficult than it needs to be for an arcade racer. The burnout games were great but Criterion slipped up here when they worked with EA.

B000ZKA0J6,3.0,"One can only respect BLIZZARD for not setting a release date before they knew they could meet it. No matter that this was the most awaited game for over a decade, they would release it ""whenever it would be ready"". Well, it is ready, it is here and it rocks. Too bad they kicked the respect bucket in the end. But first things first.

THE GOOD OLD GAMEPLAY GETS THE CIGAR
Seasoned and new gamers alike will appreciate the simple yet highly enjoyable gameplay. The factions are well balanced and the units perfectly valued. You gather minerals and vespene gas, you build your defenses, you upgrade, you expand, you gather your forces - and you unleash hell. Repeat as needed until satisfied.

STARCRAFT: THE QUICKENING
The game is much faster than the original. Resource gathering, building, researching and expanding all go faster now. This is something that will appeal to most and I for one liked it. It conveys an enjoyable sense of urgency, adding to the immersion. And because the game is richer and deeper, the tension just keeps mounting.

SWARMS!
The game designers either enjoyed STARSHIP TROOPERS one times too many or they are fond of killer bees documentaries. Either way, be prepared to have to deal with a lot of swarming enemies! The plains shall be soaked in Zerg blood leaving you with a thick metallic aftertaste of accomplishment.

SPACE. SPACE IS BEAUTIFUL
Visually this game is GORGEOUS. It looks like C&C4 was supposed to (but failed miserably). The units are detailed in design yet clearly discernible whereas the environments are superbly done (although not that variable). True, I could do with somewhat more realistic graphics but I can see that this could only be done at the expense of clarity when the number of units rises. What needs a bit getting used to is how some of the buildings do not look that different. No complaints about how they look but one can easily confuse them and build the same building twice.

COME FOR THE VESPENE GAS. STAY FOR THE STORY
The story picks up just where SC-BROODWAR left off. Following each mission nicely done videos move the single player story along (no spoilers, not to worry) that, although we are given the illusion of choosing between different paths, apparently they converge towards a predestined end.

DAMN IT JIM, WHERE IS THE REST OF THE GAME?
Why only 3 stars then? Well, in a nutshell: GREED.
Apparently ACTIVISION's influence is not very healthy to customer relations. Together with BLIZZARD they are trying to turn the StarCraft franchise into yet another World of WarCraft phenomenon - and, at the same time, using STARCRAFT II as the vehicle, turn BattleNet into the new STEAM.  Unfortunately this results in a barely palatable product and using your fan-base to advance your corporate ambitions is always tacky.
Although priced even more than a full premium game, this is not a complete STARCRAFT sequel. You would not know this by its price-tag(!) but this is only A...THIRD of the game, the first part of three: you can only play the Terran campaign. The Zerg and the Protoss campaigns will be released independently later (and priced as if they were full games, one could safely bet).
To add insult to injury, one has to keep spending even more money if he wants any ""premium maps"" and ""premium content"" sold only via the BattleNet. Since this is a game that will be played mostly online don't be quick to dismiss this if you have a competitive streak.

OK, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT - BUT THERE IS A HYDRALISK IN THE ROOM, ISN'T THERE?
Much more serious is the NeverLettingGo-OnLineActivation requirement. The game will ask for activation during installation, which also includes signing up to BattleNet (and, yes, this means that even this expensive game never becomes yours to keep). But that is not all: a periodic OnLine confirmation is also required EVERY THIRTY DAYS, FOREVER. You can play offline but no more than a month between re-activating.
Unlike the latest EA and UBISOFT flops (which have an idiotic Always-OnLine requirement), with SC2, after its initial Activation, you CAN play a single player game (campaign and skirmishes) without logging on to BattleNet. Only, to do this you have to log on as a ...""Guest"" (I know, a Guest to your own game and your own computer...). You will be able to save your progress but you cannot tie it to your BattleNet account later, so any progress or accomplishments are lost for your online Account. After your 30 days are up you have to re-activate once more.
That is why a Broadband Internet connection is included in the minimum system requirements. You can decide if this bothers you.

SORRY TO BRING THIS UP BUT SPAWN SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM MY COPY...
Remember how we could take our original STARCRAFT CD to a gathering of friends, Spawn it on everyone else's PCs and start a LAN party? Now one can play with his friends only through the BattleNet - and the Spawn function has been eliminated! Yes, that means each one of your friends now has to have his own original copy of the game!
The brass at the top conveniently forgets that the ability to Spawn games was the main reason both STARCRAFT and DIABLO acquired such huge fan-bases.
Et tu, BLIZZARD?

This is a good game, one I think we will be enjoying for years - or for as long as BLIZZARD shall allow us to do so. However, I had higher hopes for BLIZZARD's respect to its own customers.

B0000A8VBZ,3.0,"The violent killings are entertaining and some of the dialog spoken by your victims is funny. What killed it for me was the 'safe shadows' stealth mechanic: If you're hiding in the shadows, a hunter can be standing 2 feet from you, looking in your direction, and be unable to see you. Note that you are not hiding behind something, or camouflaged, or prone; you're just standing there just on the other side of the line where light/dark meet.

For a game that is supposed to be an immersive experience (e.g. hunters react to sounds you make in the headset, call for help, etc.), this very contrived and artificial implementation of stealth takes me out of the story and reminds me that I'm just playing a video game with certain programming rules that the computer AI must follow. (Which is fine except that it's not what I thought I was buying. I can play Tenchu or Metal Gear Solid if I want to play a stealth game with clearly defined ""rules"".)

 So, the game then becomes a series of
 1) try to stealth kill a hunter
 2) mess up and alert all the enemies in the area
 3) enemies chase you and yell stuff at you
 4) you run around a corner and duck into a dark area
 5) four hunters stand around your 'safe' zone peering into the darkness and complaining how they've ""lost"" you even though you're standing inches from them (hunters will NOT step into the dark zones unless they saw you run in there)
 6) hunters return to their pre-programmed routes and completely lose their alert status
 7) go back to step 1

 Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

After a while, it reminded me too much of the games of ""tag"" I used to play at school where a certain tree/pole/tire was 'safe' and you couldn't be tagged while you were touching it. Would've been much better if the AI would at least try walking into the shadows from time to time when they were looking for you to keep up the suspense level. As it is, you just sit there, perfectly safe (and bored), waiting for the enemies to cycle through their pre-programmed ""alert"" status and go back to their normal patrol routines.

Anyway, my$0.02. Depends on what you're looking to get out of this game. I suggest renting it for week first and see if you're still interested in playing it after that. I sold my copy to a buddy who loves it, so obviously it's just my perception of the game here.",Amusing for a few days

B00ZGRLJJS,3.0,"My thoughts on Transformers Devastation

First, the good (It's PlatinumGames. Of course, there's good.):
-The gameplay is solid. It's as high speed, over the top and insane as I've come to expect from Platinum.
-The music is excellent and fits the metal on metal action perfectly.
-The multiple characters, unlockable difficulties and challenge mode do offer replayability (which is nice, given the campaign takes like 6 hours.)
-I like the cell shaded art style.
-The voice acting is solid.

Now, the bad:
-I have and will continue to defend The Legend of Korra game. You'd be hard pressed to find a game in the same price range that has better quality. That being said, Transformers Devastation is not being sold as a budget title and I can't defend it's 50 dollar price tag.
-It is short, even by hack-n-slash standards
-Lacks memorable boss battles which is something I always look forward to from Platinum.
-The first 2/3rds of the game you will spend most of your time running around in the exact same location.
-They are several spots where enemies can attack and deal heavy damage from off screen. Flying enemies being the worst offenders.
-The 5 playable characters are redundant (especially given the short length). Optimus Prime is clearly better than the other four. Some attempt at balance would have been nice.
-I'm also not a fan of the weapon upgrade system but I'm not a fan of crafting systems in general. They bore me and feel very out of place in a game about all out action.

A personal gripe:
-The gameplay is very similar to Bayonetta (it even has witch time) with just enough tweaks to make it annoying. The default controls move the dodge button (luckily that can be changed) and instead of double tapping the button to transform (like Bayonetta's panther), you have to hold the button which is the same button you use to dodge. Meaning, you will often find yourself transforming when you just wanted to dodge because you held the button a split second to long. Once you adapt to it, i's not a major issue but the option to switch the control to ""double tap to transform"" would have been nice. Of course, that's just my personal preference and if you haven't played Bayonetta this won't be an issue for you (Also, go play Bayonetta.)

Indifferent: The story. I don't care about Transformers. I bought this because Platinum are the best makers of action games around. I didn't find the story interesting but Transformers fans might.

In conclusion:
If this had been released for 30 bucks or less, I'd recommend it. Unless you wanna play through the campaign several times, get all the trophies or enjoy challenge maps, you won't get 50 bucks out of this. After the reaction people had to The Legend of Korra (which was 15 dollars on release), how Activision thought charging 50 for this, obviously, budget title was a good idea confuses me. But, of course, it is Activision.
My love for PlatinumGames is as large as ever but, in the future, I will be wary of PlatinumGames that also have Activision attached to them.
Korra was acceptable because of the price. This isn't acceptable. It's fun but it's def. not 50 dollars fun.","My thoughts, as a fan of PlatinumGames"
B00012BSJ4,3.0,"When I first sat down with this game, I was in total awe.  With updated graphics, remixed music, better sounds, newer areas, and a map (yes, for the young kids, the original Metroid had no map!), it's a Classic Metroid fanboy's fantasy.  You even play as suitless Samus in a stealth mission, armed only with an automatic-charging pistol (this part is definitely one of the toughest parts in the game, since the pistol only stuns and the Space Pirates take off 100 HP when they touch you or shoot you).  The game even tells you where to go by using Chozo statues, making it much less frustration.  However, this is also a problem.  The game is easily beaten in 1-2 hours in one sitting due to the fact that you know where to go with the Chozo statues and the new weapons.  When you get to Tourian, the Metroids are easily destroyed, as opposed to how you drop off the elevator in the original and next thing you know 2 or 3 Metroids are sucking you bone dry, and you watch as your health just goes from full to 0 in 10 seconds.  Also the bosses are sissies (especially Ridley, who screeches like a little girl while you stand under him and bombard him with missiles.  Yes this is a strategy on how to easily beat Ridley), but I can't say the same for Mother Brain (who is actually far tougher than in the original), who actually uses energy waves to damage you alot this time.  But still, this is an excellent, fun to play remake of such a classic game.  Once you finish this game, you'll understand how the Metroid series has been classified as one of the greatest video game series of all time.","Easily beaten in a sitting, but what an amazing remake"

B000088KH9,3.0,"Tenchu was one of those games that really WOW'ED! alot of people on the Playstation one. It's protagonist, a 16th Century Azuma ninja Rikimaru, is probably one of the more memorable and emulated characters in the more recent video game landscape. Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven brings Rikimaru and his female counterpart Ayame to the Playstation 2 with a considerable upgrade in graphics, but with pretty much the same basic design and gameplay.
The strength of the Tenchu game series is and has always been STEALTH. With few projectile weapons and no firearms, this forces the players to get ""up close and personal"" when taking down an opponent. You do have a variety of ninja items; shuriken, poison rice cakes, even a long bow. But your best weapon is still your katana sword. So you really have little choice but to be stealthy. The game environment does offer plenty of places to hide thanks the enhanced graphical power of the Playstation 2. One thing that is different is that developer K2 has implemented an ability upgrade system. After nine stealth kills (which are kept score in the form of Kanji characters on the bottom left hand corner of the screen) you are awarded a new ninja ability. There are quite a few abilities that can be awarded. However the cinematic that plays once the stealth kills are completed is kind of goofey. I would have liked it better if Rikimaru or Ayame picked up a scroll and read the ability aloud. This would have given the game a feel more with keeping to it's 16th century setting. But this is only a minor issue. There is also an unlockable third character named Tessu that is available once you've completed the game and a multiplayer mode. Missions for both character follow different paths and have different objectives. So you are not replaying the same missions twice with both ninjas. There are also three different enemy layouts to each level and player rankings, to increase the replay value.
The controls are basically the same as the previous Tenchu games though side stepping is a bit more difficult. One thing that bothers me about Wrath of Heaven is that Rikimaru and Ayame both move very unaturally. Their motions while running, crouching, and ""sneaking"" look too computerised. Often when going to a crouch they will appear ""jerky"". Also while running Rikimaru and Ayame appear to ""skate"" across the gamescape. This is kind of disappointing seeing how the first game on the Playstation 1 made Rikimaru and Ayame move with greater flow and ease. The learning curve for this game is about 30=-45 minutes (the amount of time to get used to the controls).
Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven is a game that favors fans of the series but shouldn't let down newcomers either. It gives you just enough to keep wanting to play and is challenging enough without becoming frustrating. Mind you that this game is rated ""M"" for a reason. Ninjas are not particually nice people. If you're a stealth action fan then this game will fit nicely in your game library. For the new reduced price, Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven is a very good value worth checking out.","3 and 1/2 stars.

B00Y09G6H8,3.0,"Very affordable alternative to any other headset. I've tried Astros, Steelseries, and many other name brand headsets. I can guarantee that these headsets are the best, even when compared to headsets that are 300 dollars. They have a good bass response and are clear through all ranges. Of course, footsteps can be heard in all games. The mic is very clear and probably the best option you'll have with the exception of a Modmic. If you want a headset below 100 dollars, there is no other headset to buy than this. I recommend pairing this with a Astro Mixamp for even more superb surround sound. The only thing I wish it had was a wireless feature but of course that would mean more money. The included braided cable is more than enough for me.

Thats being said, this is a amazing looking and sounding game. But this corny Sony game lay out is getting on in years. What year is this? I played the others, and like them. But now with free roaming games that hold a ton of replay I feel this title is like 3:10 to Yuma and The good the bad the ugly is what its up against. If you don't get my drift, this game is worth a one time beat the game attitude, but I will never revist it. I hope we arn't stuck with a one dimentional character like Kratos again. I was really hoping he would grow here, but didn't. Revenge, revenge. This character wasn't made by a muscle man who gets laid thats for sure. He seems in this one to be overly tuff, like Im trying to hard. Sometimes hes cool, and other times... Well you see what Im saying. But if want historical mythological stories you can just turn around. The myths are set as a back drop, and all fused to gether for more depth. But if you want an ammuzing overly violent, sexual, fantasy that will give you one weekend of ammusment. Well this is it.","One of a kind, and like many others."
B00DHF39EO,3.0,"My main problem with this game is that it still plays like a single player game, I don't understand why this is online.

Also, I think Bethesda went wrong with the voice chat. Text would be much better. The problem is all of the foul mouthed snots running their mouths or playing gangsta rap in the background at full volume.

I quickly resold the game before the inevitable price plummet.",Not for me.

B00JM3R6M6,3.0,"This game is okay at best. It's a great way to pass small chunks of time, but don't make the mistake of playing it for a long time when you first get it like I did. I feel like I've seen everything, from all of the dreams to every rap battle lyric. It's great when you first play it and see the insanity your Miis are into, and it's very hilarious.

I wish there were more things to do in this game and that it had more unique content as time went on. However, after you add a bunch of Miis and watch some people get married and have kids, you'll be pretty tired of how repetitive it gets.

I would recommend this to people that don't have a lot of time to game and want to see their Miis do random things. The game is great, but I think this should be a download only at 10 bucks because there isn't much content at all. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews, I assume people haven't played it for a few hours just yet. I feel mislead because I didn't get nearly as much fun out of the game that people claim to have had a blast with.",Just Okay But Not Worth The Price
B00004TTHT,3.0,"Arcanum was a good time burner, but It wasn't a game that I got into very much.  Graphically I felt like this was on par for maybe 3 or 4 years ago, but for 2000 standards it was lacking, except for a few of the spells wich looked pretty hype.  Gameplay was what I felt too similar to Diablo II, a lot of point click hack and slash.  The plot was decent, but I didn't like the whole ""you are the one"" type story line, it's been played out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much.  The interface could be tricky at times, but it wasn't too difficult to figure out.  I like the character development, it was very good as far as that goes, but thought they could have used a few character classes as well.  All in all, if you want to waste some time before Neverwinter Nights comes out and you have played every other Top of the Chart RPG then pick up Arcanum, I wouldn't say it's a waste of money.","Playable, but lacking so very much"
B0002ILSF6,3.0,"While they have taken a name of one of the James Bond films, you do not play as Bond, but an ex-MI6 agent. In this game, take several of the James Bond films and put them into the same year, meaning multiple bad guys and characters are in this from different films, including Goldfinger, Dr. No, Miss Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp, Scaramanga, and a few others, including James Bond.

Story: You are an MI6 agent. 3 years ago, you were shot by Dr. No in the eye. Since then, you have sought vengeance and resort to violence and brutality to get what you want. After an evaluation at MI6, you are dismissed and you accept an offer from Goldfinger to join his organization. You are given a cybernetic eye implant from Scaramanga (Goldfinger's Q wannabe) that is golden in color, hence your new code name GoldenEye. You are tasked with multiple missions for Goldfinger, but you find out you are betrayed in the end.

Gameplay: You perform 1st-person shooter type missions in multiple locations throughout the 007 world, including the Dam, Casino, Octopus, Volcano, and many others. Your cybernetic eye is a weapon and you get upgrades almost every level from MRI to Telekinesis, and multiple hacking upgrades and a computer virus. You get standard weapons from the Bond series and you can use multiple weapons to get to your objective. You take on baddies such as Xenia, Oddjob, Dr. No, etc.

Conclusion: while the game is fun and enjoyable, it is short lived and mediocre. The game plays like it was trying to build on the success of the original Goldeneye game on the N64. It falls short in almost every aspect, but being in the 007 world is still fun and all the characters make the game unique. A sequel was planned but soon cancelled from the poor sales and reception of this game. A game that goes through the various 007 world from all the movies does sound like it could be an awesome game, but this isn't what fans are looking for. Maybe on the Xbox 360 or PS3, they can make an RPG type Bond game that goes through all the movies, villains, locations, lovers, etc. Worth playing through once, but I didn't want to play it again. Almost no replay value.","Not exactly Bond, but still fun"

B001E7MMNG,3.0,"Splatterhouse came out to mixed reviews. I can't say that I disagree with them but they were a little too harsh as overall it is a fun, gory, and exciting experience.  Let's start with the bad first. The combat does get a little monotonous from time to time. Every room must be cleared like the room before and the room before that. This gets to be a little boring after a few hours. Yes there are weapons but they are few and far between. You rely on some combos and the masks rage power to defeat your foes. You unlock new abilities but they are not that diverse and are basic attacks nothing exciting. Though I loved the Mask's rage ability.

Another weakness is the story. Though the game comes out of the gate quickly the story doesn't. It takes most of the game just to find out what happened to Rick that he needed the mask in the first place. I thought the story would drive this game but you only get some brief instances of good storytelling just a lot of stalling most of the game.  And to top it off it ends on a cliffhanger. The final weakness is the last mission. I won't give anything away but it is a protection mission. You have to protect someone for a certain amount of time. I always hated missions like this and putting it at the end simply left a bad taste in my mouth.

Now onto the good parts of the game. The controls are tight and you always have great control over Rick. Another great part of the game is the boss battles. Yes they are a bit simple once you get down the pattern but they are epic. The graphics are well done throughout as well. The cutscenes especially look very nice. The regular game play has a comic like drawn affect that works well for the feel of the game. Oh yeah and did I mention this game is really gory. It's a bloody game that screams for and receives an M rating.  There are also side scrolling missions that harkens back to the classic splatterhouse games of old. Not to mention there are some interesting platforming sequences that add some variety to the campaign along with diverse level environments to keep you visually stimulated.

There are collectibles to pick up such as journals and photos of Jennifer scattered throughout the game. They are fun to find and Jen leaves naked photos of herself all over the place for anyone to find. Also when you beat the game you unlock all three of the original Splatterhouse games which is an awesome inclusion.

Overall Splatterhouse is an exciting ride but not perfect. It is worth the reduced price it is now offered for. After all it includes the original three games to play on your PS3. I wish the story had been better and the combat more varied but in the end I enjoyed myself and towards the end I could not put the controller down.","A Fun, Gory, and Flawed Ride."

B000WMEEBC,3.0,"This game should not be in the $60 range. More like the $30-$40 dollar range. I am being generous with the $40! I don't think the graphics are that great, but the game play is fun. It is what it is...A computer game made to run on the PS3. I agree with the other reviews on here. The 4 hour time limit stinks..especially where you have other games out there that have longer gameplay and larger maps. Save your money..wait for the price to come down or buy it used.  Nothing special here and I am kind of pissed they delayed the release...as there was nothing to ooo or aaaa about in terms of QA or last minute coding additions.",$60 is too much money for this game!
B00C71034I,3.0,"This game has some things working against it, for example, new voice actors and the fact that Arkham city was one of the best games ever made make it seem like no matter what this game was it wouldn't ever be as good or better.

Basically this is the exact same game as arkham city, it uses much of the same map, controls/game play, while having a few negative like new/different voice actors and a new/worse batman costume.

By far the biggest negative to the game was that, on 360 anyway, it froze up about once a day when trying to access the map, and once the story line mission were finished it just ended... It wouldn't allow any side missions to be activated once the story line mode was complete. So after the story line missions are complete it just drops you back into the game and anything you haven't finished yet is still on the map, but if you go to the markers nothing happens, nothing is there... It's just over... whereas in Arkham City you could keep playing and finish up any unfinished side missions here you have to be sure to complete them before completing the main missions or you'll never get your percent complete to 100%.",Good game!
B002I0I85Y,3.0,"This version of the Wii remote is much better than previous renditions.  The Motion Plus sensor provides features for fun games such as Wii Sports Resort.  The silicone bumper has improved so it is easier to remove to change batteries.  The bottom port cover is also improved to make it easier to plug in accessories such as the Classic Remote.  The smaller size, compared to a Wii remote with the previous attached Motion Plus accessory, may take a little getting used to for those with large hands.

It's hard to like the FlingSmash game.  Its characters are unloveable and the repetitive wrist flicking motion required to play the game is tedious and painful.  It might be fun to play co-op with a friend a couple times, and there are unique variations to the levels, but the gameplay controls are uninspired.

If you can find the remote packaged without the game for less price, go ahead and get that.","Great remote, lackluster game"
B003UT9XI8,3.0,"... and if they don't release one, they are just too ashamed to show it and will not buy it.

I am very disappointed; I've been waiting for this game for soooo long only to just feel so pissed off. When the first generation F1 game was released by Sony at launch I was disappointed, mainly because Studio Liverpool does not watch nor follow F1 (rev limit penalties in the middle of the race...?? Among many major mistakes).

Now am VERY disappointed because this is not a third or fourth generation PS3 graphic game (I assume, and welcome correction, that the original F1 game is first generation. With Gran Turismo 5P setting the second generation along with Uncharted, Metal Gear Solid and Killzone 2. And Uncharted 2 staring the third generation with God of War III included. Fourth generation graphics basically coming up with Gran Turismo 5). The graphics on F1 2010 is not a great leap better than the first F1 (but it is), the frame rate suffers the graphics are bland (don't trust internet pictures, they are most probably from the PC version which is by far the best of the three versions) and the sound is not that amazing.

Although the rules to some extent are there (was happy to have a drive though penalty for once), however, no safety car and the yellow flags are cleared much too fast for the game to be called a sim. Especially the driving physics which are not that good (rumored to be one of the glitches to be fixed though an update) and you'll find the damage funny and the car just a bit disconnected from,,,the,, um,, you know, I think yourself as driver/player. A balance I felt lost in most Codemaster's games except for Dirt 2 which is a really good game (did not play Dirt 1 so I don't know how good that is).

The game has development issues as noted above (as of 9/29/2010) search the net and you'll find a good list, and an update is expected. Whether it will fix the issues or add features is yet to be seen.

I am using a G27+playseats, which is the only way you should be playing driving games. The controls are great and customizable, G27's buttons is supported.

With GT5 coming November, F1 2010 has stiff competition. Formula 1 is my passion, I love the sport and an avid follower of the seasons. I've seen F1 being slaughtered version after version with only a few good ones (but nevertheless, even the good ones have some features done horribly wrong).

In summary, are you on a budget? Get GT 5 only, don't have a PC that can run the game at full details (makes matters worst for me because I have a PC that can and got the PS3 version) consider renting or wait for the demo. Because you will play for to experience of an F1 season with a game (not a sim) that applied  FIA rules to fit an arcade setting.

A slight above average game 3.5 stars.

B000ZK6950,3.0,"I remember when I was younger going to my friends house and putting on Resident Evil (1,2,3) the GOOD ones.  After RE3 it went downhill.  I remember getting the crap scared out of me when I was being chased by all sorts of stuff and having that creepy music playing.  Not anymore.  This is more of a run-n-gun that involves no thinking skill.  I liked solving puzzles in the old ones and wondering wtf I was supposed to do next.  In RE5 its all straight forward.  Even the story is lame.  I miss being in creepy houses and streets.  Now you get to be in Africa in the broad daylight.  Ohhh so scary! I don't think I have had one thing jump out at me through this whole game and Im at chapter 5-1.  Theres 6 chapters.  The monsters are ok-unique.  But they arnt anything special.  The old monsters were a lot scarier and the graphics were even worse!  In RE5 the graphics are far more superior and it doesnt even do the game any justice or help at all.  Atleast in my opinion.

B0016Y9Q5O,3.0,"I think I've logged over 100 hours on the first Puzzle Quest. When I found out they were doing a Sci-Fi themed version, I was really excited because I prefer Sci-Fi over fantasy anyday. The core gameplay is the same, but the mechanic of the way the pieces fall into place has changed for worse. Instead of gems falling down into place, these hexagon gems move into place based on the direction you moved the adjacent piece. Sure, it's predictable, but it's not as beautifully simple as the first game. Additionally, the story line is completely forgettable and many of the NPCs are downright hideous. It is also a lot easier to ""get lost"" in the game and not be entirely sure what to do next- or how to do it. It's a shame because I could see myself losing a lot of time to a proper Sci-Fi Puzzle Quest.",Had a lot of potential.

Also, if you are like me and a tad rusty which I am since I last encountered the Samurai showdown on the SNES from way back in the day.  The hardest thing about it is the control setups for the various games, having to figure out which button does what is a little bit tough if you are from the old school gaming crowd such as myself having to translate the controls from the SNES to PS2.  Old School=Super Mario Brothers and it's various forms (Super Mario World, Super Mario Brothers 3), Zelda (Original, Adventure of Link Link to the Past and the rest of the Zelda series on the varying systems. Ditto for Mario.)

B00UJ9LB6Y,3.0,"---Updated Review---
I have had this case for a long time now. 1 year I think.

It looks brand new! So that's great.
Comfort wise it has been better than without it, and the case has indeed protected my DS from a drop.

That said, better grips now exist. So my rating has to go down.
This grip has always felt too shallow/does not properly and comfortably fill my hands.
I have fairly slender hands. Not massive at least.

I will be giving this case to a younger sibling because it really is much better for small hands.

My new cyber gadget grip is miles above and beyond this. And it is hard plastic.

TLDR: this is a great case with grip bonus. Not the best grip though.

My cyber gadget grip is an amazing grip, not really a good case though.

Combine the top of this with bottom of that and you might have the perfect combination.
----original review---
Much more comfortable to use! That being why I bought it I am very happy and don't think I will stop using it.

TLDR: this grip/case is the best you can find right now. Well worth it and hard to beat.

I feel it could be a better fit. If they made it a bit smaller/tighter. It isn't bad as it is. Feels like it is in there and will stay on however a few areas have a bit of slack.

Some people said it smells. I think this was a past issue because mine does not.

No card slot. Personally I like this and for me it is a plus. I use a sky3ds cartridge which has over 30+ of my games on a single card. This case prevents accidental removal of my card.

Looks great. I have a black new 3ds and this compliments it perfectly. I don't care for decals or anything. But the top and bottom are separate pieces if all you want is a grip.

There is definitely room to improve. But as of this review nothing in the market is better than this.

Shipping. I received mine the day I ordered it. Talk about fast!

Overall I am very happy. If for some reason the grip fails or becomes less than what I expected I will update this review.",Best grip/case available.

B000FRU1UM,3.0,"I waited along time for this game. I took off from work bought a 12 pack and planned on playing the best gam ever. Im not going to say Im disappointed. Maybe after the last 3 GTA's I was expecting to much. The game looks beautiful, the voice acting is excellant but the missions are already becoming boring. They seem to lack creativity, every mission I have done so far has been pretty much - find the target and kill them or give someone a ride. The online game is insanely fun but seems to lag alot. I think 16 players may be too much for the server. Alll in all, I would recommend buying this game. It is a fun game but just not as fun as I would have liked. I will probably be back to COD4 very soon. Also, I think alot of reviews up here are tempted to give great reviews because they have convinced themselves this game was going to be great before it came out. I don't know...seems like GTA 3 was better, but I haven't finished this one so maybe Im jumping the gun.",Good....but not great
B003NSLGW2,3.0,Were good for 3 months and then they started ripping and constantly slipping off. They fit well on the 360 and PS4 controller....for a.while.,Get what you paid for.
B00002SU5C,3.0,"The Good: It was designed by Ravensoft (who have a lot of Id people on their team) and it's running off of the Q3 engine.  Graphically, it's gosh darn purty.  The lighting is superb and the architecture, creature designs, and weapon designs are all top-notch (as one would expect from Ravensoft). The only graphics niggle I have is that the mouths aren't made of polygons, but are synced bitmaps (of course, to date, Half-Life is the ONLY game to get that right).  The missions are, overall, interesting, with a nice mix between puzzle and action.  A lot of the missions include team members who are more than just grunts (many of the scripts work trigger individual members for individual tasks).  The puzzle missions are, for the most part, well designed and more interesting that the standard key-find quests that are typical to the genre.  The sound is very nice too, although I wish they had included explicit EAX support.  The one ""stealth"" mission, in particular, made good use of that.  Most of the weapons are quite interesting, with all of them featuring a secondary fire mode -- the default phasers, in particular, are very fun to use, I love beam weapons.  I especially liked the rationalization for the traditional FPS Bad o' Weapons: a portable replicator that you carry with you.  And finally, the Borg have that cool laser-eye thingie that's just oh-so-cool. :-)
The Bad: Well, it *is* Voyager.  For the most part, that didn't bother me, although the long (and uninterruptible) cinematics involving the REAL LIVE (tm) voices of various actors got on my nerves.  There's also a certain cloying PC-ness to the game that annoyed me, especially given that it IS, after all, an FPS.  The game's attempts to sanitize a massive kill-fest left me a bit woozy, at times.  The plot is also less than impressive, although (frankly) it was more interesting than most of the Voyager TV episodes I've seen, and it was more than adequate for a genre that is often allergic to the whole notion of plot.  There were certain points where the game suffered from ""What do I do now?"" syndrome, although nothing too bad (when it doubt, look for a tunnel to crawl into).  Likewise, on Voyager, the doors are unlabeled so one is often required to blunder around in the between mission phases.  On that note, some of the architecture is a bit ""crowded"".  This is especially true on Voyager where there are loads of fake doors that you can't enter (and I just HATE that in a game).  The game length is a bit short (but I've been spoiled by Half-Life, so take that with a grain of salt).  Finally, the great big bugaboo of most FPS's -- The AI: it sucked.  All too often, the game resorts to simply swarming you with enemies.  There were few cases where you couldn't even discern that there *was* any AI (although there were a couple of great skirmish sequences where the enemy actively sought refuge behind crates).  In terms of combat, much of the game resembles Doom.
Overall, I enjoyed it.  I'd recommend it if (like me) you're feeling a bit starved for a decent FPS.  Just don't blow any significant amount of money on it.",Great for a Trek Game; good FPS overall
B000SQ5LNM,3.0,"Everything was ok with this seller.
Reccomended.",ok.
B0012N7BSI,3.0,"I bought the Collector's Edition because I thought it was a great deal.
I hadn't played Madden religiously for a few years.

I was ready to dive back in. I wanted the Xbox version, but the friends that would actually
play on-line only owned PS3s. So I gave up the achievement love and got the PS3 version.

I was hesitant because last year's PS3 version ran at a slower frame rate.
I did some quick research and I didn't see reports of any differences this year.

Before I called my buddies up, I wanted to try a quick game. I jumped in and started playing like I never stopped playing. The game played almost exactly the same as 3 years ago. I had to get used to the hit stick and such, but it is still pretty much the exact same game. I'm not sure if I liked being good already, or if I wanted more of a learning curve. It was a little odd.

So I fired the PS3 up and that was when the problems started. The game only plays in 720p. My HDTV in my game room is a 40"" Sony that only displays 1080i, not 720p. I had thought that after the PS3 launch titles made this mistake, EA and Sony would have fixed the issue. Nope. So there I was, stuck playing in 480i in 4:3 mode on my TV. So the graphics were bland and I couldn't play in widescreen so I couldn't see the whole field. My wide out WRs were off screen.

The Xbox version will play in 1080i on my TV just fine.

I still decided to suck it up, because the only reason I got the PS3 version was to play with buddies who lived in other states.

This is where it got horrible.
The PS3 online experience vs. Xbox live is night and day.
The PS3 was horrible.
It took us forever to get a game going. There was some kind of glitch that kept changing both of our playbooks as we started the game to Chicago's playbook. Also, the only way we could start the damn game was to hit the X button exactly at the same time. We had to synchronize our button pushing. Literally saying to eachother , ""ready, one, two, three.hit X"". This was so stupid. But it was the only way we could get the game to start.

We had all kinds of problems with my ear piece going in and out. Not sure if it was a Sony thing or EA servers.

Once we got the game going, it was fun. My Raider's beat the Chargers :-)

I will never choose a PS3 version again. It just feels so unpolished.",Buyer beware; get Xbox version if possible. 1080i warning; on-line glitch is horrible

I'm a bit bewildered by the positive reviews of this game. I know fans love the game itself, heck, I consider myself a MAJOR fan of the actual game show and man I find myself going to YouTube to check out Richard Dawson in his prime. But it's not all bells and roses in this game on my beloved Wii. First the good stuff. How the questions are answered if flawlessly executed. I thought without a keyboard that answering questions would be a tedious task with the remotes, but it works well and how the suggestions instantly come up as you start typing is great. It's definitely better as a multiplayer experience and I love the classic intro music before the game starts.

But from there, this game is a disappointment. First off, why no ability to download new questions online? It can be easily done with the ability to go online with the Wii and at the Wii store, but no, you're stuck with the questions on the disc. I had repeat questions on my 2nd game, and in many cases, they were consecutive questions that were from the previous game. 1000 questions offered seems like a lot, but really? Is it? You can easily go through 25-35 questions a game. You're bound to find repeats and eventually you're going to hear them all depending how much you play the game. The presention is average at best. While the opening theme is there on the menu screen, it's not on the game itself. There is no game show host at all, and the guy who does that voice is a generic guy. Does the job, but needs more spunk. The people in this game are prerendered for you, heck you can't even use your Mii's in the game so again, you're limited. The avatars are pretty shallow, and while you can change their wardrobes somewhat, again, it's so limited to what could have been. The game also has some bugs. I noticed when you buzz in after playing consecutive games, that the buzz sound doesn't even work anymore. Um, hello quality control? And as I said above, some of the answers for the surveys should simply not be there. I always wonder if they ask these questions to hundreds of people like they say, but sometimes I wonder.

For the price you pay for this game, 1000 questions is not enough. The inability to download new ones even makes it more of a reason to be weary of spending your money on this. It's got some fun moments and yes, it feels and plays like the Feud. But over time, I think it will end up back on your shelf drawing dust in no time.",Order with caution..
B00006C28X,3.0,"The original ""Legend of Legaia"" was a delightful game. Started out feeling simplistic and child-like, ended up surprisingly stirring and sophisticated. The graphics fit the style of the game, and it was the first game I ever played where the characters' outfits changed drastically in combat as they got new weapons, armor and accessories. It was truly a gem for the PSX.
The new game sacrifices most of the charm for ""improved"" graphics, which are shockingly bland. The colors are very drab, the characters festooned with strange lines that are supposed to delineate muscle tone, and the camera just sits squarely on the floor, with very few dramatic angles used throughout the game. It's a very boring game to look at, honestly.
The music...how can I say it? I understand reusing themes in new arrangements, but they've reused the music with no improvement in instrumentation or arrangement. It was a marked disappointment.
The only good thing this game kept from the original is the combat system, and the improvements made there are dubious at best: I liked the concept of ""charging up"" your AP gauge and your arts bar with a ""Guard"" move...it required me to make decisions about how to fight every single turn. In the new game, the Normal Arts moves add AP, and the Super Arts and Hyper Arts consume it. With special items, the length of your arts bar changes, but is always fixed, otherwise. As a result, I can set up an efficient combination of Normal Arts and Hyper Arts that will prevent my AP gauge from dropping at all. Entire lengthy battles played simply by mashing the X button repeatedly. Yawn.
Cooking is a fun addition to the game, as is combining to improve your Weapons, Armor, Items and Accessories. With Cooking, you can bump your stats up (and sometimes down) for several battles, plus get a little conversation going with your characters. The major complaint I have about Cooking is that the game doesn't keep the effects of Cooking a secret: the very first time you cook something, you know what impact it will have on your characters. Combining--particularly for Weapons and Armor--greatly resembles the weapon upgrade system in Final Fantasy 8, but with a lot more options available to you. It would have been nice to find a manual of sorts to tell you what could be upgraded to what, what you would need to make the upgrade, and where you'd be likely to find it. To fill my needs, I simply bought or traded for junk whenever I could, then tried to see what new combinations I could produce. Fun, but a bit aimless and frustrating. Combining Acessories was the most enjoyable to me, because I could always see what new skills I'd get before making the combination, and the skills can make-or-break your combat (for example, you really need anti-berserk to win the fight in the Gambler's Arena mini-game).
The story was...mmm...okay. I kept waiting for it to get started, or to throw a twist or two my way. As it is, the primary story consists of exactly what you expect it to: main character meets some other characters after initial meeting with the main bad guy, then goes and collects some stuff in the process of undermining the main bad guy's plan. No surprises.
The characters are reasonably interesting, and I really liked the firecracker attitude they gave Sharon (though her in-battle quips got seriously annoying after the thousandth battle). There does seem to be a lot of depth about the characters and many side opportunities to discover hidden surprises about them. I especially liked the consistent approach to responding to questions that was employed with Lang: whether you chose to have him agree, disagree, or tell someone off, his responses to questions posed by the NPCs were credible and in character. It was easy to make him a smart-mouth sometimes and have him be understated at other times without feeling like he was suddenly a different character.
Overall, it was an entertaining game, but a little shallow and with combat that looks spectacular but which was ultimately tedious--it was generally more entertaining to set the characters to Auto combat than to watch them perform the same moves over and over and over and over again.
If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy this one, yes. If you didn't like the first one, you'll like this even less. If you haven't played either but are interested, get ""Legend of Legaia"" instead--it plays well on the PS2 and has a much more engrossing storyline.",Flat-footed sequel to a charming original
B001D1MG8Y,3.0,"I was looking for a good, hard case to carry my DS in my back pocket. I have a neoprene case that works but it's padding makes it too bulky and stresses my pants. This Logitech case is slimmer and strong, but it's still too thick and is also uncomfortable back there. It would be thinner if it didn't hold additional games.

B004VMX7OE,3.0,"If games were scored on presentation alone, Edge of Time would get a 5/5.  The graphics,cut scenes, and animation are among the strongest  on the 3DS and really shows  off what  it can do and even almost mirrors it's 360/PS3 versions. 3D is impressive as well adding depth to the areas, making character models look like action figures ,and has things flying  right at you. The story is great and has the two Spider men (Amazing Spider Man and Spider man 2099) working together and playing off each other.  it really dose a great job of creating a sense of urgency and uses the time portal thing well. one last good thing to say is combat is fun,simple, fast and fun. The two Spider men have  good differentness that makes playing  each noticeable and  fun it their own right. Sadly  combat is shallow and really gets noticeable when your fighting  hoards a upon hoards of mindless foes over and over, that hardly adds any  new ones. Areas  are bland and tend to repeat over and over, exploring them are short thankfully and webbing is made easy  with tweaks.  The repeats it's objectives over and over till  the point of sicking. It really pads things out to make a short game longer. Doors take forever to open  so you gotta clear the room out first of guards, or the require a lot of keys that are scattered all over the place,  free fall sections go on and on are and plagued with bad controls and bad sense of direction. You do the same thing over and over and beat on the same guys over and over  the game really feels like  it's on a loop .Overall edge of time has a great story, looks great, and play great, it's to bad it's all just bland  and repetitive to enjoy.",A boring outting for Spidey

B000UZVL9O,3.0,"It would be more accurate to say that this is a fraction of the game with different extra content thrown in.

When I bought this a few years back, I expected to be getting the full game with extra content. After all, this is called Portable Ops Plus. Except while it does give you said extra content, it's at the expense of the story mode. Whether or not the story is all that great (I thought it was decent from what I had played renting it beforehand), I wanted to experience it and that is why I bought the game.

I played it for about a week (on and off) before putting it away and never touching it again. I intend to get the original. I'll still keep this one if I want to play through random missions with unique characters not available in the original game, but to this day I still feel a little bitter about how misleading this game was.",Portable Ops Minus

B000R0SS3Y,3.0,"I was hesitant to purchase this game based on the reviews from sites such as ign.com and gamespot.com, but I started to hear people say that the game is a lot of fun so I picked up a copy. They were right! The game isn't perfect by any means (the camera does take a lot of getting used to and can be a pain sometimes) but overall it is entertaining and fun. My first night playing it I put in 5 hours. If you enjoy games where you constantly search for upgraded equipment you will get hooked on this game. This is definitely not game-of-the-year material, but I would highly suggest at least trying it out if you enjoy games that center heavily around searching for new items. Personally I give this game a 4/5, but for the general public I say it will probably be more of a 3/5.",Don't let the reviews fool you
B00104KJ4M,3.0,"Having beaten the main levels so far, I have to say Indiana Jones was a vast disappointment for me.  I adored Star Wars, but Jones is missing things that really appealed to me.  The biggest fail I found was the lack of things to do in the home area.  In Star Wars there were so many things (and people!) to chop and shoot, but you can't even attack people in the college.  I know that seems small to most people, but I got a lot of enjoyment from beating up Jar Jar Binks over and over again.  Also, I found the mailing packages to earn the extras frustrating.  I feel like I can play Jones for twice as long as Star Wars and come away with so much less accomplished.  The levels were extremely long, and we experienced a few glitches with the PS3 version also.  The characters were not as exciting and individual as Star Wars either.  To me it felt as though they did not spend as much time and effort on this game as the previous Lego game.  Overall, it's a great game for kids, and as an adult it was ok, but if the next Lego game is this disappointing, I may just be done with Lego games.","Not ""The New Lego Star Wars"""
B01AC3ZD2O,3.0,"i missed the boat on pikmin 3 the first time it was released for the wii u. i didn't actually come to own a wii u until late 2014. when mario kart 8 came out earlier that year, nintendo was doing a promotion for a free game with the purchase of mario kart. a lot of people ended up picking pikmin 3 and it ended up selling out. used copies were selling for $60 and the price for a new game was off the charts.

  i was getting ready to bite the bullet and purchase the digital copy of the game for $60 when luckily, I saw that nintendo was re-releasing it for $20. i bought it the day it came out, just in case it sold out again. i always thought nintendo deepened its bench when it made pikmin for the gamecube. and now that it's reached its third installment, pikmin stands shoulder to shoulder with other great series in the nintendo catalog.

  affordability aside though, the game needs a much more interesting story/premise. the story from the original pikmin: you crash land on a planet and use pikmin to help collect the parts of your ship; cool! the story from pikmin 2: the company you work for goes bankrupt, so you must go back to the pikmin planet and use the pikmin to collect junk to sell; not so cool, but pikmin was really short. the story for pikmin 3: use pikmin to collect fruit to take back to your planet; ...lame!

  also, one additional critique regarding the controls. in the previous pikmin games, i was able to steer or guide my horde of pikmin in particular directions. this was particularly useful, for steering them out of harm's way. so far they haven't mentioned that in any of the tutorials and I'm unable to do that using any of the buttons on the game pad. so i feel it's safe to assume this function was discontinued, which is a shame.

the major selling points of this game are most likely the graphics. i remember even the remade pikmin 2 for the wii as having stunning graphics of vibrant environments. i was psyched to see pikmin in HD finally. an HD bulborg! there's also two new types of pikmin: rock pikmin, that replace the purple fat heavy pikmin; and flying pikmin. the pikmin seem to get re-tooled every game, which is cool but i wish they would keep the old types too. like with pokemon.  i liked the white pikmin and the bulbmin.

pikmin continues to be a great addition to nintendo's line-up with this one. i know nintendo is planning on doing something else with pikmin soon, maybe movies. i just hope they still crank out a game or two every couple years.","at last, pikmin 3 at an affordable price! needs better plot though..."
B005VKRGXI,3.0,"Graphics: Excellent
Gameplay, fighting and Swinging: Excellet
Storyline: Good

This game was awasom, definetly every couple of years they improve more in the Spider Man games, definetly the combat is not just smash and hit. I can definetly say the engine of Batman Arkham City or Asylym was used here but in the SPIDER MAN way, which is exactly what I wanted. If your Spider Man fan, you will enjoy this game.

Finally they made the game and story in a good way, however people always complain about the swinging in the city, that you can swing higher than the buildings in THIN AIR. I think I agree, sometimes, they can create the gameplay for swinging that shouldn't just swing in thin air. However, I am not going to say the game sucks just because of this.

The story was good but they could have added other enemies because in the games always they not necessarily stick to the movie, because they want to create another spider man world, which is FINE; but they could have added more.

I love the classic fight at the end with the lizard and the looks of it in the sewers, very similar to 60s spider man. Also, the idea of spider man loosing his powers toward end of the game because of some cross species experiment, was great.

WEB RUSH tool is EXCELLENT, but again should not apply in THIN AIR. But I am happy that these games started to use engines of each other such as Uncharted, Batman and Assasins, this game had the same feeling but in spider man world.

B0012N94WO,3.0,"First, let me say that I loved RE4. I've played all the RE games, most more than once. The first one and RE4 are my favs. So I was hoping for greatness. This game is good, not great. Yes, the graphics are amazing. Beautiful to look at. However, the locations/sets are pretty boring, especially compared to former games. It just felt bland and repetitive. As for the gameplay, it was fun for the most part, but there are many instances where it was just plain frustratingly annoying. I like a lot of action, but I also like to have a break in the action so I can catch my breath and do a little exploring. You don't get that much here. And the weapons kind of suck. Even after you updgrade them they never become really powerful and give you the feeling that you can plow throw hordes of enemies. RE games are notorious for being very limiting with health and ammo but this game seems worse than all of them. Some of the bosses had cheap attacks too.

So, unfortunatly with this one I didn't have the feeling of wanting to start all over as soon as I finished. Just too many frustrating moments, not enough cheesy RE puzzles to figure out and lots of repitition.

It's good, just not great. Play with a friend, it's more fun. Also, I don't get the RE4 comparison at all. This game is not as good as RE4.",I'm somewhere in the middle on this one.

B001E9F1QO,3.0,"Other reviewers said how its not 64 bit, another went through how it was. Let me settle this. It is. But, has alittle more perfomance then SNES. But in its defence no third party ever took to this machine. Yeah the controler was strange, the  design of the system has a kind of sci fi look to it. I like the design of it, but thats probably its best aspect. The games, well. Some work; and some don't. Also there are very few good games. I mean Kasumi Ninja is one of the better ones, and its one of the worst MK rips around. However there are a few decent games like Atari Karts, Doom, Wolfentstien, and AVP. What this system is, well now is camp. Its not common, and its gone up in value since I got one. So I think this will be one of those, so bad its good.

B00ICWO1XA,3.0,"While I love the game and the story, I have to admit I loathed the game for a long time. Something compelled me to keep playing though. Probably the game's great sense of style, story, world, etc. And the fact that Witcher 3 is nearly perfect, and W1 and W2 were must-plays because of that fact. In the end, however, I have to say that W2, while compelling and even good in some places, it's an absolute technical mess. I have lost so many save files because of the game's wonky saving system. Glitches galore. Too many inexcusable flaws to give this game more than 3/5 stars. It's a great game if you can ignore the flaws or muscle through them as I have, but this game is both great and so so so soooo very bad.

I love it, but if you're not obsessed with Witcher like I have become since finishing Wild Hunt...I just cannot recommend this game to you.",Great and Also Garbage
B00175GC5E,3.0,"I say that this game is good, and better than the more current versions because unlike the rest which are all a multi-console port with tacked on control schemes, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2009 was built pretty much from the ground up for Wii.

The motion controls are a definite part of the gaming experience and it is a lot of fun! Basically, your character is a complete bore - its up to you to make them do fun things to rile up the crowd. This comes into play mainly during your superstars entrance. You can raise the Wii-mote and Nunchuck up to make your character put his arms in the air, or you can shake the Wii-mote to jump up and down while perfectly cued fireworks shoot off in the background. Each character has a few different entrances that you can control when they happen by which motion controls you use. It really feels like you're in control! Like our favorite superstars who don't always do the same exact motions every time they walk down the stage, you can choose if you are going to point angrily at your opponent, or if you'll choose to slap high fives with the fans on the way down, or if you'll tear up a haters sign and throw it at them.

As you can see, the motion controls are a really fun addition to the game, and also set it apart from all the other versions of the game. While, like the latest installments of the the game, the Wii version is generally always a few steps behind, from not having the best graphics to not getting certain modes that the XBox and Playstation versions of the games get. But this game truly got something that set it apart, and in my eyes made it better than the other console versions.

That being said, there are a few minor hickups. As stated, it is lacking some of the innovations the other SvR 2009 games had on other consoles. As I said previously, the graphics are the main thing, while you also will not be able to customize exisiting superstars clothes with the Superstar threads functions (which means you'll either have to create your own version or play as characters in their outdated attire), you'll also have difficulty playing I think, because this game has no online play that I could tell. I believe its another feature that only the other versions of the game received. Also, having to use the Wii-Mote in the game sometimes, you will have to push strange combos in order to do what you want. Also, I just felt like I needed to mention this somewhere but I feel the AI is brutally hard on this game. When you are playing the career modes against the computer it seemed that they would go from being easy for a few rounds to then being brutally difficult.

All in all, if you don't need the latest and greatest features and want to play a truly unique game, SvR 2009 is the game for you.",Original and Better than current iterations
B005YR308S,3.0,"...2 stars for the rest. Its layout is much too rigid. Movement is awkward and clunky, difficult to adjust to, and then there's only so much freedom. Too linear for my taste, and I didn't like how it jumps from character to character. I like the characters, just not how they are set up to be played. You don't get to choose when you play them.

If the graphics weren't astonishingly beautiful, the game would suck. But...that's just my opinion. ;) You might love it.",3 stars for graphics

B00KPY1GEK,3.0,"EA Sports isn't treating NBA Live 15 like its a critical release for the series which desperately needs to establish itself on stable ground and show potential to achieve significant growth in the market within the next few years. In fact theyve shown little urgency at all and even have basically admitted its not a stellar product. No one would have been fooled otherwise but it stands in stark contrast to the way the company promoted previous failed efforts where they instead presented a certain bravado and failed to back it up.

After spending the six hours with Live 15 through EA Access the murky picture has cleared up somewhat. No, it doesnt really deserve credit for being better than Live 14, but standing on its own its a decent effort. That comes maybe a year or several years too late but the progress being made is evident and some may even find fun to be had from the product.

The best way to sum up NBA Live 15 is that it would have been an acceptable Live 14. It has a lot of gameplay-related issues, and doesnt offer much in the way of compelling content, but it has its share of successes also and this time around the problems could potentially be overlooked in favor of just having fun with it. That really wasn't possible with Live 14 which EA probably would have been better off for the long-term not releasing.

One of the biggest issues with Live 14 was that it lacked any sort of tutorial or practice modes. That has been rectified this time around and EA even forces some of the tutorials on users when they first start up the game. Theyre effective in teaching simple elements of playing the game and there are a bunch more that aren't included in that initial run-through. Practice and scrimmages are also available.

Gameplay displays much more fluidity to the action though the stiffness of players and animations remain and there are instances of warping and sliding around the court. A lack of off-ball movement is a concern even with LB being used to manually force some movement. The CPUs offense seems to be based on taking a ton of three pointers and maybe getting an offensive board for a put back. However the ball does seem to go through the star players, who stand out fairly well from everyone else, and even the CPU recognizes that on defense as they doubled LeBron James each time he touched the ball in one game I played.

The new shooting meter and release timing feedback seems to be a positive in that you do get an understanding of why a shot may have went in or been off the mark. However, even with a great release, I haven't found any contested shots being made. Its not even worth attempting a contested shot. It could be due to sample size or it may be a serious issue  its just not something I could determine in that period of time.

Areas that stood out to me as big positives compared to Live 14 were in rebounding and stealing. It seems like the right guy is pulling down the board even though there are so few rebounding animations that you see the same ones over and over. Steal attempts seem to be handled well with lunges and strips really depending on where the ball is and how its being protected. Going for a steal in the wrong situation will result in a foul but if you time it right and go at it right theres a chance of success. That can lead into fast breaks another big element of basketball that was completely missing last year but is represented fairly well in Live 15.

ESPN presentation does bring with it a certain undeniable authenticity from the music to the screen wipes and score bug. The commentary duo of Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy adds good emotion to exciting moments but in general they're too generic and unspecific in their calls. Bringing back Mark Jackson (he was recorded with them for NBA Elite 11 before he got into coaching) would probably spice things up in future editions. The crowd and atmosphere is very good bringing back some memories of NBA Live 10 which truly excelled in that area.

Rising Star mode remains a very basic and bland Career mode. Theres no off-the-court angles to the mode so things get boring real quick. Teammate AI seemed better than that found in the competitions Career mode but it still seemed as though the bulk of the scoring relied on me. You have more control over what happens, which could be seen as a positive or a negative, as calling for a pass will always get you the ball and pressing the shoot button will get your teammates to shoot. I put up huge numbers in the Jordan Take Flight Showcase and got drafted #3 to the Sixers. It seems the game bumps all the rookies back a pick then so a big chunk of realism in the mode is damaged as almost all rookies end up on the wrong team.

Also included in Live 15 is an Ultimate Team mode which brings in much needed features like an Auction House, and Big Moments which I still find uninteresting and anti-climatic upon completion. Dynasty mode is largely unchanged from last year and theres no Online Dynasty or Leagues. Its also important to note that there are no sliders in the game so those who like to tinker with gameplay won't have the ability to do so.

Online play, and server stability, is being touted by EA Sports in an attempt to take advantage of the difficulty the competition is having. However online play was very poor in Live 14 and the limited experiences Ive had in Live 15 have been about as bad. Input lag makes timing jump shots nearly impossible  everything comes up with a late release and theres really no way to adjust and find the successful release point.

It remains to be seen whether Live 15 will be enough to keep the series from being buried for good. The odds appear to be stacked against it surviving another year. Theres now at least something to point towards as evidence that the franchise could get to where it needs to be someday. After four years of failure, and a complete erosion of consumer loyalty coupled with the rise of the competition, that simply may not be enough.

If you're interested in the game try out the demo/trial on PS4/XB1 and then maybe wait for a deal on the game. Black Friday is less than four weeks out.",NBA Live 15 is the game consumers deserved last year. A decent effort but comes up short in most areas.

B000TTDLFS,3.0,it is fun to play.,Three Stars
B000SQ5LQ4,3.0,"Let me start by saying that 70% of the game is absolutely super fun!  If I could have given it 3.5 stars I would have, but that's not an option, and this game just doesn't deserve 4 stars.  I've been a gamer since Asteroids was cutting edge, and can play witness to the amazing jumps in technology...  This game (with it's very few, but MAJOR flaws) is a step in the right direction.

That said, the 'flaws' cannot be blamed upon the programmers, but the designers.  There was some extremely poor decision making at the managerial level, and I fear that it will hurt the title.

I have played about 2 hours and have enjoyed (about 70% of it) IMMENSELY.  The graphics are crisp and the action is really cool.  They continue to have issues with face-mapping, clipping, and screen tearing, but, well, they chose to use the Unreal engine...  You do the best you can with what you have, I guess.

PROS: (There are many)

BUGS: I bought the game the day after release and have not had a single technical issue. The menus are intuitive and useful.

HINTS: I love the cut-scenes and the hints written all over the place.  It was a little distracting at first, but now that i'm used to it, it really adds to the game-flow.

DIALOG: I like that the NPCs have more than 1 or 2 sayings.  In the past they have had 2 sentences that they repeat endlessly.  This is an error that has been corrected and it really adds depth to the game.

SCENERY: The colors (when you're allowed to see them) are sharp and attractive. Color is what gives us depth-perception, and this game is rich and aesthetically very, very attractive...  Most of the time.

CONS: (The list is short, but noteable)

STEALTH... The 30% where I'm in the shadows and the game goes monochrome and you lose your depth perception...  Wait, MONOCHROME?!?  Oh, give me a friggin' break...  Really? That's the absolute BEST solution you could come up with? You couldn't put a sliding scale indicator on the screen somewhere?  The folks that made this decision fully deserve three stars. You know, I've been in shadows before in the real world and looking at things OUTSIDE of the shadows did not cause me to go color blind.  VERY distracting, unrealistic, and a game-killer for me.

PLEASE*PLEASE*PLEASE patch the game to allow those of us with binocular, color vision to turn this absolute MISTAKE of a feature off.

LANGUAGE: I have not played a game with as much profanity since GTA: San Andreas.  I was not expecting it, and really, it takes from the game play.  I'm not worried that it will influence the little children playing, because really, if you're young enough to be impressionable and your parents let you play this game, well, you're pretty much screwed up beyond return already.

I don't even mind the words, themselves, but rather the unrealistic volume of their usage...  I'm an adult and I cuss, but I don't cuss because I need another word to go into a sentence to make it longer.  It's like the writers went in and said, ""Okay guys, we need to add 600 words to the script. Single-syllable, if at all possible... I KNOW!  We'll just randomly add words that end in 'it', 'itch', and 'uck'!!  Yeah, that will solve the whole problem!""

That's it.  2 CONS, and lots of PROS.  3 stars?  Yep.  They earned it.  It's a shame, too, because the rest of the game is half a hair away from being bullet-proof.  That said, I think I've had enough.  I'm going to write this off as a $65 one-night rental and give it to a friend.

P.S. MONOCHROME?!?!?  No, seriously, MONOCHROME???  Gimme' a break.",AMAZING game play...  But monochrome?  MONOCHROME?? REALLY?
B000U1OOH4,3.0,"This is by far not a super high quality Joystick but it was worth every penny that I paid for it, which wasn't much.  It works with all of the simulator games that I play and has a lot of configurable buttons.",Worth the Value Paid
B000VJRU44,3.0,"First of all, remember that this is *not* a ""game"". Its a way to get your 40 minutes of daily exercise without making it feel like a lot of work.

What this means is that you probably won't buy this for your under-11 year old. Before you start the ""game"", you are asked for an objective ... in terms of how many pounds you want to gain/lose. Whether this question is meaningful for your child depends on many factors - and other reviewers question the use of the BMI measure for kids, anyway.

The only true game component of this are the ""Balance Games"" which turn your balance board into a snowboard, or into a tightrope, etc. However, I don't expect kids to return to this game everyday just to play. In short, its not a replacement for Wii Sports.

So, how does it fare as an exercise regimen?

Not very well so far. I use an elliptical for aerobics, and a [...] machine for strength training, and I can't see myself as shelving those two in favor of this toy. With the elliptical, I can adjust the resistance, get feedback on my calorie burnout, and can determine how long I want to keep going. Best of all, I can even watch TV, listen to music, or read a magazine if I care to.

With the Wii Fit, the cutesy graphics are good, but once the novelty wears out, I'm guessing the chinks in its armor will begin to show. My TV is taken up by my virtual Mii running along, I get to listen to canned music, and there's really no way I can read along.

Strength training is purely isometric exercise based (such as push ups). So, if you're fairly fit and need to work with additional resistance, this is not the place to come find it.

Yoga is where it truly shines. I tried the breathing exercises and a few of the postures, and the instructions were fairly detailed and easy to follow. I expect that I'll use this as a cheap and convenient personal yoga instructor for months to come.

The final aspect worth mentioning is core muscle control and balance. I particularly enjoyed learning how my body is balanced, and it does highlight whether you tend to favor one leg over the other. I can see this as being a worthwhile tool as part of a physical rehabilitation or therapy regimen.

To summarize - if you have trouble getting motivated to exercise, or get bored by exercise machines at home, or can't get to a gym, and you don't care about its limitations, then this is for you.

For those who are really serious about losing weight or getting fit, either setup a home gym or get a gym membership. This will be fun, but will likely be a large waste of your time. The biggest problem would be the inability to set up a sequence of activities that you could run through one after the other. Having to navigate menus to start up the next set is distracting. There is a Favorites tab that lets you get close to achieving this - but I haven't tried it enough to see if its a good replacement.

I'm still in the ""novelty"" phase - so I'm going to try and make this work. I like the way it tracks your weight/BMI, which is much better than the paper and pencil approach I use currently. However, as stated before I expect to use it more for the balance and yoga portions, *after* I've completed my aerobics/strength activities on more conventional machines.

Bottom line - as with every Wii product, the apparent ""shortage"" drives up demand and makes this seem more desirable than it should.

As long as you are aware of its limitations, you're in the best position to determine whether this is for you.

Update (Week + 1):
I've averaged about 30 minutes/day in the past week using this product, and here are some updates to my initial observations:

(a) I've been surprised with how interesting the kids find it. They can't wait to get higher scores than me, and are constantly pushing to get ranked higher in almost all activities. Every evening I come home to scores that are better than mine, and am forced to play catchup. The balance games were an expected favorite, but I certainly didn't expect push-ups and the tree pose to capture their fancy.

(b) The menus are nagging at best, and annoying at worst. My workout style is to focus on the activities at hand without needless conversation/distraction, and that's hard to do when I have to repeatedly click the A button just to get started. The text has this annoying teletype format as it prints across the screen, and can't be dismissed until it is displayed in its entirety.

(c) This is compounded by the fact that this device can be very chatty. While some of the messages are good to know, I'd really like the option to turn these off. Counting the number of messages that I need to click past has become a running joke for us now.

(d) Because I can't automatically string together activities in a logical sequence, I need to have the Wii-mote handy. Finding a home for it is a challenge when I don't have pockets, or need both hands for balance and can't be bothered to hold on to it (as in some of the more kinetic strength activities, or the yoga poses that need my fingers locked together).

(e) Even worse is that you need to aim the Wiimote at the screen to click the menu buttons, which is an exercise in frustration. I'm mastering the art of using the arrow keys (the rocker switch) and the A button while the Wii-mote is in my pocket, but its still a problem when I hit the wrong button, which I seem to do frequently enough :(

(f) A yoga/gym mat is a necessary accessory - otherwise having to lie on your back when doing the jackknife for your abs means your flooring comes in contact with a very sweaty T-shirt. I'm not so certain about the silicone cover. We've used ours pretty rough, and I don't see any serious stains or dirt on it. And anyway, I like my workout machines to show some wear as a badge of honor :)

(g) There is a half baked interface which allows me to track activities that I do outside of the Wii - such as jogging. So far, I've been logging my other workouts, but since I don't seem to earn Wii points for those, I can't tell how that factors into the overall Wii experience.

(h) The BMI/weight tracking using a line graph, is really a nice touch.

(i) Rather than a primary weight-loss device, I use it as a nice way to wind down from a heavy workout, and it serves that purpose very well. A commenter below questioned its usefulness for yoga. True, it does seem funny to learn yoga from a game console - but the funnier thing is that the yoga poses do seem to work very well to ease up strained muscles. Combine this with the immediate feedback as to how well you are balanced, especially on single leg poses, and you have a really unique combination.

(j) The balance games are fun, but I tend to spend only a fraction of my time on them. I'm willing to take Nintendo's word that its good for me, but I'd rather spend my scarce exercise minutes on the other Wii Fit activities. After all, there's only so many times I can enjoy riding my bubble to the end of the stream.

(k) The fact that the balance board is wireless is a wonderful touch. Its easy to hide it under the couch when its not in use.",Adjust your expectations and you'll have a lot of fun
B001NY42JC,3.0,"Did these developers cut corners run out of time, or funding?  Ace Combat players and flight sim players beware.  I'm unclear if this game was going for arcade clunk or a sweet flying experience.  This game ties in history, storytelling, and radio chatter nicely - other than the fact that it's a game and you can drop hundreds of bombs in one go, after they re-spawn under the wings, of course - or that all of the ancient planes mysteriously have computer targeting.  The controls are not much in your favor during intense dogfights - the hands and fingers will become little gymnastic contortionists as they learn to successfully maneuver the aircraft.  Looking around to see is a constant struggle.  The joystick must be clicked and held down while moving it about to free-view anything; while the camera is constantly & forcefully trying to pull itself back to center - like your head is stuck to a hundred rubber bands.  The control setup options shouldn't even be there, because nothing helpful is there to choose from (like removing stick-click-n-hold or rudder control assignment).  While playing, I couldn't even figure out how to go old school; turning off the HUD so I could get a better feel - instead of being distracted by all the little future's-in-the-past HUD dots locked on possible targets.  Some of the planes never got modeled on the interior either, so you'll get stuck playing a few missions in 3rd-person view.  Visuals, sounds, and flight physics are beautiful.

B000FRVAD4,3.0,"""Hopefully a more thoughtful review discussing the good, the bad, and the ugly in Fable 2.""

Have you ever just got a new system and were blown away by the first game you got for it? In many ways that was my situation with Fable 2. I was even wowed by the little things such as the detail in the leafs. However when I read my first review it seemed biased. Sure I was wowed by Fable 2 and yes, it still is a great game. However having spent time in retrospect I do have to take some things into consideration which I did not before.

The first is Fable 2's controls are great. Being able to fluidly switch between melee weapons, guns, or spells on the fly makes the combat fun and a seamless experience. Even if you are someone who normally detests RPGs for their slower pace would be hard pressed not to get into Fable 2's quick real-time action fights.

For gamers that missed Fable 1 many more expressions and actions are added to your socializing wheel than in the first game. The more you play the more articulate and expressive you become so even if you were not able to impress the bloke or lass you had a fancy for earlier on you can come back later and likely achieve the desired effect.

If you want open ended options Fable 2 does throw some nice additions into the works. You can get married and even have children. As time goes on you can also buy up lands and stores which will bring you a steady income. Though it may be hard to see at first Fable 2 has a life simulation aspect that cleverly hides amidst all your treasure hunting and monster slaying. Fortunately if you have no desire to sire children or have a spouse you are never once forced to partake in these activities. Like almost anything else in the realm of Albion it is optional.

Want to play the game as either an evil knave or spotless hero? Fret not. That is the whole premise of Fable 2 and chances are your character is not going to be identical to the one of your friend. Focusing on magic gives you glowing veins, eating certain foods makes you thin or fat, and you can change your hair and get tattoos. Your virtuous and foul deeds also take a toll on your physique and alter you over time.

You are also accompanied by a faithful canine companion that helps in finding treasure and fighting games. Treating your dog kindly or cruel does effect his behavior and appearance. Furthermore do not expect teaching your pooch to be easy. Though you may see it as harsh punishing your dog is good in certain situations as is playing with him or rewarding him with treats. Being too lenient can endanger your pet just as much as being mean to him. As in all things balance and moderation is key.

Teaching your dog new tricks is as simple as finding tomes filled with knowledge. ""Dog related books"" will boost his combat skill, awareness, trick repertoire, and ability to dig up better items.

The last big thumbs up I'll mention is you can be male or female. At least that opens a door to girl gamers that was previously closed.

With all this you may think I'm saying the game can do no wrong. However now we come to the things that are suffice it to say not so pleasant about this over hyped game.

My first qualm is though it seems like your decisions shape your world near the beginning of the game as you reach its' climax your choices narrow. Good or evil you are still out to stop the man who wronged you and your sister. Good or evil you are presented with the same options in the ending. You can continue the game filthy rich, continue the game by saving all those that fell to the corruption of the head bad guy, or rather sacrifice your family. In one of these choices you lose your mutt because yes, he counts as your family too.

Now I know some of you are thinking I spoiled the ending for you. But that's the rub. There is no actual ending. You do not see what happens to Albion if you triumph as a villain or as a saintly knight. Either path you choose Teresa gets the spire and you get the shaft. The game continues on in its' monotony and though you are made aware your sister is alive if you choose to save your family there does not seem to be a way to be reunited with her.

My second gripe is many of the quests you do are repetitive. You can save the slaves or capture people to be made into slaves. You can assassinate villagers, sacrifice innocents to the temple of darkness, make a donation to the temple of light, or help everyone you happen across. Sometimes you may even be asked to clear an area of monsters. While this is fun near the beginning after you've done each of these quests 10 times over the nostalgic sheen dulls considerably.

Third we come to the creature selection. While you may expect a variety of neat beasties they are limited. Bandits, hobs, balvorines, undead, trolls, giant bugs, and banshees cover every thing in Albion's glossary of gloom. It is true there are a few variations among each opponent type but the game is so long you'll get tired of your antagonists quickly yearning for something more unexpected such as the Kraken in lost chapters. The ""boss fights"" are so non eventful chances are you will not even see them as boss fights.

The next quarrel I have with Fable 2 is some areas seem incomplete. For example you come across an orphanage that has no use and later on while swimming around you see places you should be able to eventually get to on the horizon yet you never do.

Lastly though the socializing system seems fun at first you quickly begin realizing the people you interact with are missing a certain endearing quality. Perhaps its' simply that everything you use to interact with them is a gesture or attempt to entertain them. You never have villagers that stand out or provide you with more interesting conversations. Pretty much they all will like some things you do but disdain other things you do. However even if you make someone mad one of their favorite gestures will have them praising you in no time.

Sometimes its' good to make things just a bit linear. For example in Persona 4 most of your relationships lead up to one or two conclusions. Yet each conversation you have with those characters delves into their hopes, desires, aspirations, and fears. They actually ""talk to you"" like a real person and you immediatly feel attached to them.

Fable 2 by comparison uses the same villager skins many times over and though everyone may have slightly unique traits this is buried by their repetitive responses and similar mannerisms. For example you can marry two wives that look and act so similar the only way to tell the difference between them is by their name and what gifts they enjoy.

So IS Fable 2 a good game? By all means ""yes"" it is. While I do not agree over it getting ""Game of the year"" from G4 TV I admit Adam Sessler made valid points in his blog on why they came to that conclusion. In the end ""Game of the year"" is simply another opinion. I do not hate any other reviewer for having a different view-point than myself. There is enough immaturity online as it is without fan-babies firing off insults left and right.

If you are tired of J-RPG fever and want a game that is easy to jump into, fluid, fun, and you have a lot of time to kill Fable 2 is still a highly recommended purchase or rental. While it may not be ""perfect"" it is still addictive and engrossing on its' own merits!

Pros

+Silky smooth easy to learn controls

+Added canine companion who really is useful.

+The social wheel is more complex and you pick up more expressions as the game continues.

+Albion is MUCH bigger this time around!

+Some choices do indeed drastically change the world around you.

+ Art direction, music, and visuals are all breath taking to behold.

Cons

- Towards the end good or evil you are given the same choice which yields the same repercussions.

-Villager types and enemy types are lack luster and repetitive save for a few exceptions here and there between long stretches of playing.

-The socializing system while adequate is somewhat detached and both adults and children seem to respond to your gestures in the same boring ways over and over again.

-Certain areas seem incomplete.

-There is no actual endings to further the story-line

-Certain jobs get quite tedious especially if you do them in tedium for many hours. I suggest buying shops and land so you'll have to work less often.

-Quests get more and more similar.

-Some glitches and freezing.","Wonderful but yes, it is flawed (some spoilers)"

B00UXI36FU,3.0,"Let me start by saying I am a Neverwinter Nights man and not quite a Baldurs Gate lover. I played a little bit of Icewind Dale and Diablo 1 but never did the many of the isometric RPGs this game tries to emulate. That being said I still love the tactical combat, pause and play era.

While I am glad games like Divinity and Pillars of Eternity sell well and get these rave reviews I still feel like they are missing something that the modern era of games like Dragon Age and the Witcher bring to the table. For starters the graphics here are a little TOO dated. I mean I get that is what they were going for, and while the environments are nice the character models don't fair as well. Out of six people none of my characters really stand out. The models are grey, brown and dull with no real sheen or sex appeal. Why can't we have something with the unique look of Dragon Age Origins with this pause and play old school style? Why can't it look like a modern game but have the spirit of what made us love these games back in the day.

Since the models are so ugly, zooming into combat is a huge chore. Characters blend together in big glob - trying to guess where your people are is a chore and watching combat play out isn't as exciting as in Dragon Age Origins or Divinity. You can queue up commands but there is no visual feedback that you are doing so. Pressing ""shift"" lets you queue up multiple move or attack commands but like in Neverwinter Nights where it would show your queue on the top of the screen here it doesn't even give you another icon. You're left guessing what half your fighters are doing, minus a super small icon next to them when you click. Not very intuitive.

Characters seem to randomly join you for no reason, but at least you're given more reason that in Dragon Age Inquisition. For instance a wizard randomly joins me after I kill some drunken villagers and we become best pals with no real rhyme or reason. The models for unique characters (NPCs who join you) are nothing special, they blend in with everyone else.

Storywise the game is solid. I do like the novel-esque text you're presented with during dialogs and interactions. For some reason reading about a character seems better than watching a cutscene. Though I wish the story so far was a little better. Though it's not bad by any means it seems a little random and convoluted. In premise it's cool - you're a ""Watcher"" who can see a soul's past lives, though it's presented a little hard.

I wish they had gone 3D environment instead of prerendered as being able to rotate a camera to see the action and give orders is sorely missed. In Neverwinter Nights and Divinity this was awesome to be able to zoom into the action and queue up commands or see around objects.

Overall this is a solid game. I would love a true Neverwinter Nights 3 that took what's best about Divinity, Dragon Age and games like this and mixed them up and produced a slick tactical RPG without the dumbing down that the dragon age series has become and  the tedium and ugly graphic sheen that Pillars has. Maybe someday.

If you're a diehard fan of these games you prolly already bought it and are down voting this review but if you're someone like me who is a fan of tactical RPGs then you will probably like this game. Though you may be better served getting Divinity: Original Sin instead if you have to choose between the two","Solid, but not the second coming of RPGs"
B000IGE78M,3.0,"This collection includes Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics. 2 and Tactics seem to work fine but i bought it just for Fallout 1 so i'll talk about that.

Fallout 1 was released over a decade ago. This DVD installs Fallout 1 version 1.2, released in 1997, long before Windows XP. i already owned this game but my copy didn't run on XP so i bought this. And learned that this has exactly the same problem. Specifically, the game screen goes black every few seconds. i spent a couple of hours searching Google and found that this was a common problem but that there was no solution. Common solutions offered include updating (or downgrading) graphics drivers, trying patches, setting the compatibility mode and adjusting screen resolution, none of which have any effect. So i was really, really sad when i got this game (again) and realized i still couldn't play it

i spent another couple of days researching it and i think i've got something. The screen in Fallout 1 (but not 2 or Tactics, which are newer games) goes black because some application changed the way it looked. Maybe a Web browser refreshed itself or an icon in your status bar changed colors. Anything that changes the way it looks causes Windows to redraw the screen (to update it to the new way it should look). Fallout 1 doesn't know that, even in Win 95 compatibility mode, so it gets blacked out by Windows but doesn't redraw itself

The solution is to shut down everything before starting Fallout 1. It's not a great solution and it took me several days (this time; i tried before months ago) to figure out. None of the Fallout sites that i found mentioned it. But i've been playing with it for a few hours and if i shut down my Web browser i only get the black out screen once every five minutes rather than every five seconds

i'm assuming you already know about the game. It's ancient and it feels that way (especially the inventory management) and looks that way but it's a ton of fun. The game itself is 5 stars but getting it to work on any computer sold in (roughly) the last decade is a 1. Few people will put up with the technical issues but it's great if you can get it to work",Technical issues but a fun game
B001LLPV7E,3.0,"This cymbal trigger functions just like the two that are included with the ION Drum Rocker game controller. I used a gift certificate to make this effectively a $20 purchase, and let me tell you, at $45 I wouldn't be nearly as satisfied as I am right now.

Setup is relatively easy, though partial disassembly of your kit may be required depending on where you want to position this cymbal. Function so far is comparable to the original cymbals - in other words you may have to play with the mount a little to dial it in just right. As with the original pieces, it's a ""clunker"", making a rather loud, dull noise when struck.

I have also used Pintech TC triggers with my ION, and while a bit more expensive overall, they are quieter - and in my opinion have a better feel to them.",Worth it for the mounting hardware
B000WCN8IW,3.0,"Since no one's reviewed this one yet, I thought I would give you guys a rundown of the basic gameplay to help you decide whether or not to buy Viking: Battle for Asgard

Basically you start off as a viking warrior tasked with defeating the evil hordes threatening your villages. Its more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. To defeat these evil armies, you have to accomplish a series of small tasks, in whatever order you choose, in order to then complete the larger tasks.

For instance, you might have a problem like ""the evil legions of Hel have taken over the old fort. raise an army and drive them out"" and to accomplish that you'd need to kick the bad guys out of a farm so the guys in your army have enough to eat, free a group of vikings being held prisoner in an old mine so you'll have enough troops, and find a special key to open the gate to the fort

So you can do all that in any order you want, finding gold, killing bad guys and freeing small groups of prisoners on the way. You can spend your gold on better weapons, magical runes, healing potions, etc. You use the runes to integrate fire, ice, or whatever into your regular attacks. For instance, a fire rune gives you a burning sword for a certain amount of time

Once the little tasks are done, you summon your army of Vikings and go have a big battle with the bad guys at the larger objective. Assuming you win, you can then wander around and talk to NPCs to find out information and get new tasks and quests

I played this for about 4 hours yesterday and thought it was ok. There's only about 4 or 5 enemy types, and they break down into: soldier, big soldier, soldier with shield, soldier with bow, or assassin. All of those except the assassin are basically the same thing and you just have to hit them more or less times to kill them

Speaking of hitting people, you use the A button to attack with your sword, which is a fast attack, and hit X to use your axe for a slower but stronger attack. You combine those two buttons and the left trigger and bumper to make various combo attacks. Its all very simple and intuitive, and probably something you've seen a million times before

There's a token stealth feature, where you can sneak up on a guy and kill him with one shot, but since you usually find enemies in groups of 5-12 and once you kill the first one the others catch on that you're there, it doesn't really do you alot of good to sneak up on them.

The main appeal of this game to the casual gamer are the slow motion and extremely graphic kill shots when you do combo moves. Chopping people's heads off, cutting them in half, holding them down and stabbing them in the eye, cutting their arms off, etc. Plenty of gore and brutality for the teenagers to enjoy

For the older gamer, or maybe just people who don't love gore, there's not alot here to hold your interest after 3 or 4 hours. Its basically just running from quest to quest, buying supplies, and cutting the bad guy's limbs off, assuming no drastically new ideas are introduced farther into the game than i am now

So as of right now I'd have to call this one a rental, unless you just really love Vikings. Hope that helps you guys make a decision",Middle of the Road Hack and Slash Title

B00008DHNZ,3.0,"I acquired this game free with the purchase of a new Xbox to replace one that died on me. I wasn't expecting much due to some pretty negative reviews trashing the repetitive gameplay and ho-hum graphics. So I was surprised when I popped it in and after playing for a little bit discovered I was actually having a lot of fun.
The game mainly involves piloting various modes of transport -- a hover tank, an aerial gunship, a speeder, even a two-legged beast of some sort -- and blasting any enemies that get in your way. It is fast-paced but satisfying to watch your targeting reticle bob around the screen before locking on to a soon-to-be doomed enemy and dispatching them will a volley of laser fire or perhaps a well-placed missile. There area also times when you will play a Jedi (Mace, Annakin, etc) on the ground. While these bits got slagged off by some gaming press, I found them to be pretty enjoyable. Your repertoire of tricks include throwing the light saber like a boomerang to take out far-away foes, doing acrobatic flips and jumps to avoid enemy fire, and taking out whole groups of evil goons with a blast of the Force from your outstretched hand.
The graphics are not eyepoppingly stunning, but they are solid and definitely convey the feeling of being in the Star Wars world. In the scenes where you fly the Jedi gunship, you can see scores of soldiers and droids blasting it below you, giving you the sense that you are part of a larger battle. I'm not a die-hard SW fan, but I did grow up on the movies and find the game does a decent job of filling in some of the events following the end of the ""Attack of the Clones"" movie.
Initially I was going to give this game four stars, but I gave games like ""Halo"" and ""Project Gotham Racing"" four stars, and this game, while fun, honestly isn't on the same level as those heavyweights. So it only gets three stars, but don't let that stop you from just having a good time in the Clone Wars.",Low expectations lead to a pretty fun time

B00004U62D,3.0,"I couldn't say I'd expect much from this game. It is a kid's game. But it's not that bad. You start the game on 1-player, and Kimi basically says how you need to get a helmet to defeat the big bad snail guy, yadda-yadda-yadda. From then on in story mode, you pick your character, and just walk around picking up tickets and buying things. It's not that fun, it's really slow, there is only a little theme park music in the background... this game is better in two player, where you can play bumper cars, golf, and a few other mini games.

Graphics: 7.5/10. The characters look the best as they ever could on a Nintendo 64. These are great cartoony graphics.

Sound: 7/10. The voices sound fuzzy and somewhat unclear and there is very little sound; no little talk-to-selves when you are running around in story mode, and all you hear is the theme park music. It puts me almost to sleep.

Control: 7/10. Slow controls... the babys walk extremely slow, and you can't run and turn at the same time. If you want to turn, you have to stop moving, which makes the game take awhile to get to a-to-b.

Fun: 7/10. This is an OKAY game. There are 5 different parks that you can goto, that are all different in their own way. Ooey Gooey World, Main Gate to Euro Reptar Land, Golf Park, Princess Theater, and Reptar Island. It's a DECENT game for someone who's bored on one player, but multiplayer is where it's at. If you buy this game, I highly reccomend you have a friend with you to play multiplayer. This game isn't the best Rugrats game though; If you have a PS1/PS2 buy Rugrats: Search For Reptar (PS1). It's a better game. Have fun.

B0021TVYCG,3.0,"UPDATE:

Sadly, my review (see below) has to be downgraded down from the initial 5 stars (I love it) to a neutral 3 star (meaning ""It's Okay"").

Everything I wrote below is still valid but, as I kept playing, it became increasingly clear that 2W2 was rushed to market before it was finished:

- About half of the land mass is out of reach. You simply can't get there, the makers made sure to surround it all with tall mountains.
- As you progress through the chapters, and each chapter is loosely associated to one of the world's 'islands', you move from densely populated, quest-rich lands to increasingly empty, more barren landscapes with few quests to complete, the last islands, the largest of them all, being 90% off limits.
- Neat features such as 'sailing' go largely unfulfilled. Strangely, there is no commerce between the several islands and, once you find the only boat you can actually sail, there's really no place to go.
- My 60 hours of play (I play slow so expect a 40-hour run for most) produced a most powerful character, armed with the most fearsome and cool-looking weapons, wearing a near-impenetrable armor. Sadly, it also produced an empty world. Everybody and everything that I could fight other than a couple of cats and ants is dead now so there's nothing to do other than kill 'guards' which gets boring fast.
- I will not discuss the plot but I will say that end-game could have been scripted better.

And, finally, the online mode is unplayable. It's extremely frustrating to learn that, after all this 'work' developing your in-game character, making him powerful, skilled and well equipped, to learn that you can't use it online. You are supposed to create a 'new' character or several characters 'from scratch'. Why? Nobody knows but I didn't feel compelled to even try 'online'.

So, it's 'goodbye TW2. It was a nice game for the first 30-40 hours but I expected more. Overall, it's not a bad game but it could have been A LOT better. The way it is now, only mediocre. If I knew what I know now, I would not have bought the game.

_____________________________________________________________

MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:

As I am playing Two Worlds 2 (TW2 for the rest of this review) and enjoying every minute of it, I can't help but compare it with similar past and present RPGs. I'm thinking of Oblivion, the Fallout series, Demon's Souls and keep dreaming about the 'perfect' RPG. And the reality of TW2 seems to suggest that, given the technology and the reality of a budget, this is probably as good as we are likely to get, at least for a while.

Two Worlds 2 is far from a perfect RPG. It follows the open world RPG conventions and expectations in many ways but, clearly, some of its features could be called 'steps back'. At the same time, other features can be called brilliant innovations and stunning as far as RPG conventions and technical advances go. TW2 is clearly at or close to the top, considering whatever else is available today for the current generation of consoles. Without a question it is a playable, most intriguing, addictive game. I know this because the 3 RPG players in my household, me and my 2 teenage boys are keeping the PS3 up almost non-stop and reserving time to play nothing but TW2 for hours and hours and sharing tips and stories at the dinner table and at breakfast.

I don't want to do unfair and biased comparisons but it's a fact that TW2 is nearly all we play at this time, meaning that we stopped playing 'New Vegas', I plated GT5 on a temporary hold at level 35 and two 24-hour races short of the ultimate trophy and Little Big Planet 2 is barely acknowledged by the kids these days. So, let's go into some specifics.

THE TECHNICAL MERIT

When compared to the 'older' great Bethesda RPGs such as Oblivion and the 2 Fallout releases - and I call the Fallouts technically 'old' because they are built with basically the same tools used with Oblivion - TW2 shows significant and in some cases revolutionary improvements. And here they are, probably not a complete list.

- Bugs-free. After over 100 hours of TW2 play (me, and the kids together) we haven't experienced one single 'freeze' or crash. Not even one. Other than one Baboon, floating 6 feet up in the air, no bugs I'm aware of.
- Quick saves/load. There's no such a thing as 'near-instant' saves or 'loads' but, when compared to the Fallout titles, Oblivion or even the great Demon's Souls, TW2 load/saves times are fast. On a PS3 it's probably 1/3 the load/save time you would experience on New Vegas. And, unlike it, TW2 does not bother saving your game every time you enter a new house or cave which makes for a significantly smoother gaming experience. The 'auto saves' do slow down the action for a few seconds but it's up to you whether they happen every minute or every 10 minutes or every 20 minutes.
- The savanna. The only comparison can be made with old Oblivion because Fallout's desert didn't require such a 'live' environment. If Oblivion's landscapes were stunning and I thought they were so at the time, Oblivion couldn't handle 'water' and 'fire' very well - game would slow down to a crawl and sometimes crash whenever there you had fire, lava or flowing water in the background. TW2 thrives on showing us what open plains look like. Walking or riding through TW2's great plains is almost a National Geographic experience. As for fires, waterfalls? No big thing.
- Water. Probably one of the most stunning advances in TW2 is the Ocean. I showed TW2 to a couple of friends and the two things I showed them first was a Safari and then we went for a swim. After the Safari, with Cheetahs waiting in ambush in the grass or motionless and blending with the environment on top of  boulders bringing 'ooos'  and 'ahhhs', the swim experience left them speechless. I can't think of any other game in existence that does it better. Try it.
- AI. Not all is brilliant and some of it is dumb but, whomever did the AI for the Cheetahs and the Warthogs and the Baboons should be congratulated. It's simply beautiful. The savanna animals and the rendering of the ocean are hints of what 'next generation' RPGs could be like.

On the not-improved or 'not implemented' category that clearly fall under the technical/technology category, I was disappointed that something like Havoc's engine, so well integrated it Demon's Souls and to some extent in Oblivion and Fallout is nowhere to be found in TW2. With some few, well marked exceptions - swimming is one - you can't interact/change the environment much. Yes, you fight your enemies and there's blood (or green goo) splashing all over but you can't, for example, cut an arm or squish a but or push a boulder. Swimming looks great but, once you come out of the water you're as dry as you were before you got in it.

Another little technical quirk is the 'voice' part. Not the acting which is good but, more often than not, the beginning or the end of statements appear to be cut off. It's like if you are playing a small sound file and whomever cut the clip did it in a hurry and missed a fraction of a second from at the beginning or at the end. It's probably what happened so, whomever did the sound editing did not do a very good job and it can be distracting.

THE WORLD(s)

I'm nowhere hear finishing the game (just reached level 26 and entered 'chapter two' at the time I'm writing this) but it's safe to say the the world is 'large' and there's plenty to do. I've mentioned already the great plains but, of course, there's a lot more in TW2. There are mountains to climb, deserts to explore, oceans to sail, caves and dungeons to... survive, farms, towns and cities to visit. TW2's underground features and its towns look a lot more organic than Oblivion's and Fallout's. In Oblivion it was easy to identify the Lego-like components used to build the dozens of dungeons and other structures. It's possible that TW2 has a limited number of building blocks but it's either so many we don't notice or there's some custom layer superimposed that's hiding them and everything feels a lot more realistic. You find individual houses, winding streets, commerce plazas and crowds of people going about their business in the towns and they really seem to resent you if you don't mind yours and bump into them  so if you hear screams of 'were you raised in a barn?' or a girl giggle when you don't control your walk too well, it's not personal.

There is a lot to explore and experience on your errands. Once you visited a certain area, you can 'fast travel' after that if a teleport could be found and you can ride a horse if you don't mind missing the opportunity of doing a little hunting for beasts or 'monsters'. And, talking about beasts and monsters, there's plenty of them and you can make it your mission to rid the world of them. Some of the animals tend to respawn but most of the entities that fight back with weapons appear not to. Which is okay because there must be thousands of them.

The 'people' are either of the kind that mind their own business and expect that you mind yours but, of course, there are merchants, artists, individuals that will interact with you in connection to one of your quests as either friends or enemies or bosses and the members of the several leagues: fighters, thieves, mages, merchants and so on. Your reputation or notoriety plays some part in the way people interact with you but it's the various leagues that tend to keep track of what you do for or against them and afford you some preferential treatment on that basis.

THE STORY

Oh, the story. But, does it really matter? We like RPGs because the reward of completing quests and solving puzzles we become increasingly more powerful, get to wear cool armor and weapons, cast awesome spells and, as we progress, can successfully fight and defeat enemies that would have blown us to pieces with a sneeze at the beginning of the game. In that respect TW2 meets the expectations. You start weak, you learn about the world around, you do the quests and solve the puzzles and, as you do, you level up and get to wear the cool armor and use the cool weapons. Hopefully, you'll be able to save your sister and beat up all the bad guys - the Emperor - eventually but... you don't want THAT to happen too soon because RPGs are about the thrill of exploring, fighting, looting, learning and growing. I haven't finished the game so I'm not quite sure what the story is exactly about but... I can't say that I'm dying to find out at this time.

THE RPG CONVENTIONS

It's not essential but it's probably interesting to mention the way some of what we call the RPG 'rules' or expectations are implementing in this game so, here they are, in a list format.

Controversial
-------------------

- You don't eat, drink, sleep. Or you don't have to. And you never get tired, hungry or sleepy. Sure, there are potions and useful plant remedies but you could finish TW2 without ever taking a bite or drinking one drop of anything liquid.
- Your apparel/weapons/armor don't wear out, don't break. Once you acquire a sword it will always be 'as good as new' for as long as you use it, no matter what you do with it. One of my kids says that you could mess up your weapon if you swing at a locked chest but I have to check that.
- You don't tire while fighting. There is 'stamina' but it appears only to apply when you run or swim. During combat, you can swing your big half-ton battle hammer for as long as it takes and you'll never break a sweat.
- There is no compass. There is a way to follow you path on the big map or the on-screen minimap but only the big map tells you which way is North. In-game, what you get is a GPS-like view.
- There are no set classes. This has been much discussed and it doesn't bother me a lot. You are going to naturally pick a mage-like or a fighter-like path and I doubt it's possible to build a powerful character unless you pick one. Trader, necromancer, thief... these are secondary past times but you probably must specialize in either brute-force or spell-casting.
- Skill reset. This bothers me a lot more than the above. TW2, or one of the NPCs in it will allow you to basically reconstruct yourself and redistribute nearly all of your skill points. In other words, you can spend dozens of hours to build yourself as the fiercest sword fighter in the land and, for a small fee, you can turn yourself into an arch-mage.
- Health regeneration. This is something that we've seen in the older RPG but not in the more recent ones. In TW2 your health comes back and even you 'poisoned' status goes away for as long as you are not in combat with your weapon drawn.
- No weather. There is some day/night transition and what seem to be 'morning mists' but that's it. No rain, snow or wind experienced so far.
- Anything other than weapons and armor is weightless. You can carry 1,000 potions, bags full of medicinal roots, mutated hearts and giant scorpion poison glands and a one hundred volume library on your back and it won't slow you down one bit.

Well Implemented
--------------------------

I enjoy the way TW2 did leveling. Each new level grants you a few more attribute and skill points. You get more skill points for doing 'things' like killing lots of animals or picking many locks or brewing a number of potions and so forth. Your level and your skills decide which weapons/armor you can wear. Skills must be first taught before you can assign point to them and skill books are either offered to you or you find them or you buy them if you can afford it.

Weapons, armor, staffs, shoes can be upgraded if you have the proper skills, can be sold/bought or you can break them (again, if you have the skills) into their components to be used when updating other items. Depending of how upgraded your equipment is, you can attach to them various crystals and improve either attributes (strength, accuracy, will power) or skills (lock picking, blocking).

Spells are cast with staffs which can be broken apart and upgraded as described above and are build each on separate spell cards where various spell modifiers interact to produce some very customized ones. Of course, you will need the skills. And, as a mage, you need to specialize in air/water/earth/fire or necromancy and acquire the related skills or maybe try to master them all.

Combat is not as realistic as I hoped. Demon's Souls will continue to be the best and smoothest combat RPG I'm aware of but it's a great improvement over the Bethesda games. There is thrust, swing, block, block breaking and the game is quite responsive to controls. However, as I mentioned before, you never get tired so it's quite easy to stun an enemy and almost never give it a chance to fight back if you keep spamming your best move. The enemies do block you and they do try their own tricks so combat is good by comparison but it could be a lot better.

MY RATING

It's clear by now that, with all its shortcomings, this is a 5-star game for me because Amazon's 5-stars mean 'I love it'. Which I do. Clearly, there is no perfect RPG yet and TW2 comes with major shortcomings. However, overall, TW2 is a superior game which I expect to play for quite a few hundred hours, and I am not aware of anything compelling in the PS3 pipeline probably until Skyrim launches in the fall of 2011. Which is why I'm saying 'buy it' because these are big budget products and if the talented people who are giving us these great games can't be paid, no one will hire them to do the next great RPG.

________________________________________________

NOTES:

Nothing on the 'online' features yet because we've been too busy with the story mode part so far and had no time for online. So far, the best online (combat) RPG I am aware of is Demon's Souls.

Not part of this review but, here's my brief, head-to-head, one-sentence evaluation of the current major RPGs currently on the market.

* OBLIVION - huge world, great story, good humor, major slowdowns on melee scenes involving multiple characters and/or flowing water/burning fires/lava, occasional crashes, lots of huge, mostly cookie-cutter dungeons and ruins, occasional crashes, long load/save times, auto-saves every time you pass through a door.
* FALLOUT - world not as large as Oblivion, great story, great humor, buggy, terrible melee combat, crashes, short main story. Did I mention buggy? Long load/save times.
* FALLOUT NEW VEGAS - world same size as the original fallout, OK humor, feels like a large FALLOUT DLC, even more bugs and crashes, longer load/save times, melee still bad.
* DEMON'S SOULS - the best online integration in any console game so far, incredibly brutal, the best hand-to-hand/melee combat, bugs-free (one crash in over 600 hours of play), the 5 worlds are relatively small but all is polished to near-perfection, load/save times quite long.
* TWO WORLDS 2 - not much of a story but enough quests to keep one busy for a long time, basic humor, incredible outdoors environment, okay melee, large world(s), addictive, open world but player is strongly steered through the plot, extremely good implementation of magic and weapons/armor forging but many shortcuts (see review), bugs-free, short load/save time.

B00GJSUUC0,3.0,"It's to short it's like a demo, the price is way too much. your in the same area every mission same place. Gameplay is awesome and its a great game, controls feel great.",great but few downers
B0002B90T4,3.0,"It is a shame really, Activision really needed to test out this game a bit more before releasing it. Of course this is for PS2 and they also released this on other consoles Wii, PS3, and PC.

Menus - I have no complaints it is easy to navigate, but lacks any real tutorial, the guide doesn't help, there aren't any real hints online either.

Music - Unimportant in the game, and not very memorable, it can be played without music.

Casting - In the menu Options for Gameplay there should be away to always leave on Easy Casting, but you have to do it for each fishing session, the option is missing from the Menu screens Options, only available in a fishing sessions options. The normal way of casting is very difficult to be able to do, I can't get more than 5 feet to 10 feet or so. With Easy cast I can't cast further than 58 feet, which seems to be enough. The game hints at negatives for Easy Cast, but I don't know if it is smaller fish, or less chance of a bite, or what, it seems not to effect gameplay much other than actually allowing for a decent cast.

Hooking - A real pain at times, the first two hours I played I didn't get one bite, the next go around I was doing fine, it is dependent on lures, and the speeds you pull them in, even if you move your rod. Some lures come in quick and give little time to attract the Fish, other lures, can take awhile to reel in but seem more likely to land one. I think the game needs to give hints on how best to use each lure, since the reel in for them seems to make a lot of difference.

Boat controls - Simple enough all though the boat at times is unresponsive, and seems to have pressure sensitivity, not that I can see that it is necessary.

Reeling in a Fish - This seems to be where a lot of the developmental problems happen, Once I had a vanishing fish, there was nothing on the line, until I got it back to the boat. When you do get it close enough your character will just grab the fish. If the fish tries to go under the boat, or around the boat it seems primarily to the left, then the screen will blink like crazy, causing a strobe effect, it actually hurts my eyes, and happens to frequently. As for the meter, it moves to fast at times, and you might be in the blue, half a second later it is in the red and the line has broke, or you could be just at the verge of red, and without warning less than a second later the line has gotten to loose and the fish has got loose.

Free Fishing - Fun, but no records count, and they should.

Tournament - Create a Character is not there, you get to choose between I thin 10 pre-made characters and you get to rename them.

Other Pros - Fun, Time Consuming, Decent Learning tool.

Other Cons - Some of the tournament rules, it might take a few tries to win a tournament, and it seems the longest ones are the most difficult.

I would recommend this game though, I have now played 5 different fishing games on the PS2 and out of them this is the best I have tried, problems and all. It is fun to play, my main beef is the lack of tutorial, flashing screen when fishing, no records for free fishing, horrible manual casting, and lack of a decent character creator.","Not bad, could be better"
B0002WYUA2,3.0,"What strange turn of events has prompted yet another combination of characters from various 2D fighting realms? Surely not the surge of 3D fighters such as Dead or Alive and Mortal Kombat! Once a powerhouse in the 2D fighting-game arena, Capcom's latest amalgam of pastel-shaded brawlers quickly relegates itself to more-of-the same status. It seemed like a novel idea: tap the fighting rosters of Darkstalkers, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter III, and Red Earth (whew!) into one giant brawl-game, and it can't miss, right? Unfortunately, Evolution falls short and fails to live up to its name. Evolution is a novel attempt to re-kindle the ""uniqueness"" of the Marvel/Street Fighter crossovers, but without any real gimmick. You can choose two different fighters before each match and change the lineup after each round. One of the few twists is to secretly select your fighter for the next round. The fighter lineup is a diverse one, and it makes for mostly even matches, yet for some peculiar reason, it was deemed fit to include Red Earth, an odd, obscure title that barely surfaced in the arcades. These characters are the oddballs of the bunch and don't mesh with the others. The gameplay is pure Street Fighter, with the usual half- and quarter-circle motions and charge moves, plus the controls respond splendidly most of the time (thumb-taxing Super Arts techniques aside). The optional analog-compatible stick is a decent option, as it makes complicated moves like Zangief's Screw Piledriver much easier to execute. The visuals are loaded with the trademark Capcom 2D splendor, and the fighting stages are loaded with subtle details like other Capcom characters lurking in the background. In the end, however, Evolution is too routine to stand out from the crowd--especially for Capcom fighting vets. After a few rounds, you should be more than satisfied.",Five franchises for one game?
B0002CHJAA,3.0,"The reviews given by Amazon authors Joe Juba and Matt Miller are spot-on.  Xenosaga Episode II is very short for an RPG.  And yes, the gameplay has been altered in a negative way.  However, any fan of Xenosaga is obligated to play this game.  Episode II contains exciting and emotional cut scenes, offers further development of the main characters and continues a deep yet interesting storyline.  Just be prepared for a few inferior modifications.

I, too, was disappointed with the change in voice actors, but I saw it coming and therefore wasn't overly bothered by it.  Not everyone sounds different; I only noticed Shion and KOS-MOS with different voices.  Thankfully, the characters' mannerisms and speech patterns have been left intact.  To me, that's what's important.

Another noteworthy downgrade is the music.  Episode I had a full symphony orchestra (with chorus) for it's soundtrack!  Not so with Episode II.  The music isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing that makes me want to buy the soundtrack CD, unlike the first game.  The sound effects are pretty much unchanged.

If you want to collect everything the game has to offer you must take on the optional sub-missions, called GS (Good Samaritan) Campaigns.  There are 36 of them, some of which are quite lengthy.  The time spent on these sub-missions is equal to, if not longer, than the main quest!  There's also Segment Files to discover, which Xenosaga veterans are familiar with.  They should have named this game's title Side-Questsaga.

Also, can anyone tell me why Episode II comprises two disks?  Episode I is only ONE disk, yet it has more cut scenes and is twice as long!  I suppose Episode III will comprise THREE disks and only be 1/3 as long as the first game..!  It's puzzling...

Oh, and why no database in this Xenosaga?  Episode I had a useful database of facts the player could access any time to keep track of all the terms, items and significant events in the game.  It was stupid to drop that feature.  There IS a brief recap of the events from Episode I available to read, but it doesn't make up for a missing database.

The one, single improvement over the first game is the removal of the mail/plug-in module system.  I found it annoying trying not to miss any of the items and information offered by the mail system attachments.  I was glad to see it go in Episode II.

Despite all the negatives, Xenosaga Episode II is still worth playing, at least for fans of Episode I.  Let's just hope for a grander epic in Episode III.  There's plenty to improve at this point.",Xenosaga's Brief 2nd Chapter
B00E8JZILA,3.0,"I am reviewing only the PS Vita version of this game. Given the number of Game of the Year and other awards it has won, it goes without saying that the game is fantastic, and will draw in everyone from casual to hardcore gaming.

With that said, the PS Vita version, is terrible when compared to the PS3/360 version or others. You will often run into horrid frame-rate problems, constant loading screens, and so much jittery-ness that you will find yourself even more rushed on a decision than you would have been anyway. This version does add touch-controls, but honestly they add little to the gameplay and don't make it more fun than the ps3 or equivalent version that doesn't have them. If you are obsessed with touch, I have not tried it, but I would guess this would run as well or better on a newer iPhone.

As far as the game goes, it's a lot of fun, but your decisions mean very little. Right now, the sequel season to this is out on PS3/360/PC, but not Vita, so if you want 'your decisions to carry over,' as is a big selling point, it might make much more sense for you to play this on another platform.

With the issues in this version, both digital and hardcopy; I would strongly recommend against it vs. another platform. If the Vita is your main gaming device and/or you are like me and find it hard to finish a game that you cannot take with you, I might recommend this, because it is still an awesome game regardless.","Great Game, But Better On Other Platforms"
B0012ZPYQM,3.0,"I enjoyed playing the game.  Its more of a shooter with some editable parameters than an RPG.  My biggest issue with the game is that it is short.  A good RPG should give you roughly 40 hours of play.  This is solvable in ~14.
The game takes place soley on a large space transport.  There are no other ships to deal with and no planetside exploration. As the main character you kill aliens and cyborgs upon your space craft.  You can collect parts from these kills or find them around the ship in containers and boxes.  These parts can be used to upgrade weapons you find or buy health packs and grenades,as well as improve your or your robots stats.
You have the choice to apply cybornetic parts to yourself during the game and these can make you stonger, but you lose humanity.  This opens up various skills in the skill tree and can allow you the use of different weapons.  The game is completable without using them so they are not completely necessary, but a nice way to change up play.
There are two possible story lines in the game, but play is very similar so its almost the same story line, just different dialog and end movie.
The strategy is addictive and using the environment to help with difficult battles is fun.  I don't see a lot of replay value in the game, but perhaps online multiplayer will add to that.
I gave the game an overall 3 rating as it is fun, just too short for the cost.",Fun but short
B00JELFIOE,3.0,"I would give it 5 stars for the first few days of play as they were very addicting, after that it became very stagnant and eventually I traded it in. If this game came out at $30 it would be much more relative to what it's worth.",I would give it 5 stars for the first few ...
B000WCCURW,3.0,"Pros:
- Fun to play.
- Lots of action and cool loot.
- Story and setting based on Greek mythology instead of generic medieval Europe.
- Different skill sets allow you to customize your gameplay to suit your own preferred style.
- Reminds me of old school top-down RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.

Cons:
- Enemy respawning is very frustrating.  You can spend hours clearing out an area or trying to move forward through a new map, but if you have to quit playing for some reason, you end up having to kill the same enemies over again.  It can get tedious after a while.

- Most loot has minimum level and/or attribute requirements.  For example, some equipment requires at least a certain Strength or certain Dexterity in order to be equipped.  This means that, sometimes, when you find an awesome piece of gear, you can't use it right away.  If you want to save it for later, you have to haul it around in your inventory until you finally do meet the requirements.  And get this:  because of the way the savegame function works, if you accidentally sell the item, you have lost it forever.

- While it does have a savegame feature, it is very limited.  Essentially, the savegame resets the game world (causing enemies to respawn and unclaimed loot to be lost), and starts you back at the last Rebirth Pool you encountered.  If you make a drastic mistake, you can't simply reload.  If you die, the game just restarts you at a Rebirth Pool and penalizes your experience.

- It feels a bit dungeon-crawly.  The sheer number of enemies on the map, and the distances between the different points of interest, it feels like there is nothing but combat to this game.  You really only interact with NPCs for quests, and even those exchanges feel limited.

Other Thoughts:

For the price, this isn't a bad game.  I played it for a whole weekend, pretty intently at that, and I barely made it as far as Delphi, the 4th of about 7 major cities in Greece.  But it looks like there are even more cities in Egypt and the Orient.  So, yeah, there does appear to be lot to this game.

The story is a bit lackluster. Mostly, it's just, ""Go to this city and look for this person,"" followed by miles of wilderness adventure; lather, rinse, repeat.

People used to games like Skyrim will probably find this game somewhat dated.

I can't say I love it, but I can't say I dislike it, either; it is frustrating, but also fun.  I will probably finish it just for point, but I'm not sure how likely I am to return to it once I do.",Frustrating but fun.
B000B6MLS2,3.0,"As soon as I had heard Next-Gen was going wireless I'm thinking ""great, Duracell/Energizer found a new way to make a killing"". So I started my search for this. these were instantly loved by all who bought and immediately reviewed them, so I just went right ahead and got 2 for both my controllers, to save all that money on batteries? totally worth it...for the first few months. The Batt Packs actually die out fairly soon, Duracell rechargeable last longer then this, so the Packs turn out to be pretty pathetic. STILL the charge cord itself acts as a plug to power your control even without the battery pack inserted, so if your short on cash to spend toward batteries your not out of luck, as long as your not a literal mile from the TV, the cord is reasonably long (and as a side note the controller is so much lighter with out batteries in it). Wireless is a nice concept but I just don't have the money for all the batteries, especially with all the money I'm putting into XBOX Live, Microsoft must think everyone's as rich as they are.

B009RXUNZI,3.0,"Laptop users: beware. This headset has issues with computers. You see, on a smart phone, (such as an iPhone and Android) you can use the microphone without the entire mess of wires that came with the headset. For some reason, that doesn't translate to PC. You are forced to use all the wires if you want to talk with your headset. Of course, the sound works perfectly with just one wire. But the fact I can't use my mic is really disappointing. Trust me, this headset sounds great. But when you need 4 different giant wires to work the microphone itself, it's just not worth the struggle. I was hoping to have a great quality microphone when gaming with some friends while in other places other than my house. That doesn't seem possible, sadly enough. One minor issue, but it's a huge disappointment.

Okay, I am editing this review, as i've ran into some more issues. On Xbox Live, your voice is EXTREMELY loud. It is so annoying to others, all of my friends told me to switch back to my old headset, as they could not stand to head how loud my voice was.

You can't adjust its placement, which is annoying to my friends. Sure the sound quality is great, but your friends will beg you to change your mic.",Laptop Users Beware
B00005ML10,3.0,"This game begins with some serious promise, and some good old nostalgia with my good buddy snake.  I enjoyed playing as Raiden for the most part.  I was just pissed off that I didn't get to play as snake more instead of playing as Raiden like 90% of the time.

Pros
1.  The story and the graphics were really great.
2.  The characters had some serious depth to them, and you were introduced to some old bad guys and good guys as well.

Cons
1.  There was a lot less boss fights and longer cutscenes in this game, and I didn't enjoy that at all.
2.  You don't get to play as snake that much.  This game should have been called METAL GEAR RAIDEN.  Ughh.  Overall a fun game, but I wanted to play as Snake more.

Overall this game was entertaining, and worth playing just to keep up with the series.  Also this game has one of the most epic boss fights in gaming history.  A sword fight with your adoptive father.  Enough said.

B00519BF0O,3.0,"Hard to do fine movements with this controller.  I do like its overall size, and the triggers are nice (especially L2/R2), but the joysticks make it VERY hard to aim precisely.  There is a big dead zone in the middle, and when you finally move, it jumps abruptly.  I play BFBC2 mostly.  The ""turbo"" function is OK, but basically unusable in that game (cycles too fast and the fully-auto guns ""jam""; pistols jump with recoil and are hard to aim).",Not a precision instrument.
B002E1OXVU,3.0,"It's not terrible, but they made a large number of poor choices. In some ways, it's better than last year, but in many ways, it's actually inferior. For one, there's all this music in the game, including the theme songs for a few of the recent PPVs, but you can't use them for your CAWs entrances. What's that about? I can't afford to download all my songs on my list and port them to my PS3 for that, I just have too many.

I also got my wish of getting the Abilities system back, but until I get a word somewhere about how to unlock them, they gypped CAWs in that department, not allowing them to have Resiliency and the like right off the bat, when you get mostly useless abilities if the ones that are availiable to them right away aren't the ones you want them to have. I mean, what were they thinking? Last year, we had to unlock them and you could start Career Mode with an actual Superstar or Diva to find out what you need to do to get them. This year, you can change them to suit your whims, but even if you do Career Mode with someone who is there, they don't freakin' tell you what you need to do to get them! Although, there are abilities that weren't in there last year.

And why is it that half the single player Road to WrestleMania stories are for unrepentant heels? Seriously. Edge and Randy Orton are two of the characters you can use in RtWM, and in both stories, they're as intolerable as ever. In fact, Randy Orton's story has Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase making an even worse heel turn, and they keep Orton the same. I mean come on, if that were to happen on the actual shows, Randy Orton would be cast into a face role. Or, if they wanted Orton to stay the same, it'd be DiBiase and Rhodes making the face turn, but not here. Their characters all just get worse. What were they thinking?!

And why is it that the music that plays when you're doing anything but playing matches and making your own stories that of heels? I don't want to see The Miz, so what makes them think I want to hear his music? I can't bloody stand any of them who are heels whose music they chose for that. Mark Henry and MVP don't count because they're faces on the actual shows despite still being heels in this game.

And where do they get off putting us on a points system for our CAWs? 48 points. That's what we get, and if we can't get the desired look with that, then we can't have the person we wanted to create. They may look like they're actually people who are there, but they're not as flashy as the real ones. Oh, and the Paint Tool is no help if you're not good at art. Still, I favor more simple character designs, so for many of them I could create, 48 points is more than enough.

Inclusion of Legends like The Rock, Cowboy Bob Orton, and the Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase is a nice touch, though. Even if you can't use them in Road to WrestleMania. Seriously. They got the Million Dollar Man and Dusty Rhodes to do voices in this game, so why couldn't they have a Legends Road to WrestleMania and have one or both of them be the ones? And since we're on the subject of RtWM again, I think it should be mentioned that the only Diva you can use in that mode is Mickie James. And yes, Stone Cold Steve Austin was only available through GameStop. Sorry.

But it's WWE, and you can have your CAWs become champions. That's good, especially when you consider all the titles up for grabs in this game compared to previous iterations. Seriously, you could have one of your CAWs become Champion of Champions.

And on the subject of CAWs, if you use them in any match, not just Career Mode, they gain ability points which you use to increase their skills. To improve said skills, they have to level up. To level up said skills, you have to consistently have them do that in matches.

You may be noticing a pattern here. I'm mostly focusing on the negative things. That's because they didn't make enough good choices! I actually prefer SvR 2009, and that game is horrible compared to previous SVR entries. Not nearly as jacked up as SvR 2010, though. I am seriously disappointed with this game. I am not kidding when I say this game is brand new, but already I'm eager for SvR 2011. And if that one is even worse than this one, I'm gonna stop getting new SvR titles after that one.",In Dead Serious Honesty...

B017L187YG,3.0,"I didn't have high hopes for Overwatch after watching some trailers but a few of my friends had this so I picked it up. Here's my disappointed review.

What is Overwatch? It's a fusion of Team Fortress 2 (First Person Shooter) with a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) selection of heroes. It takes place from a first person perspective and has a variety of game modes to play from escorting the payload, capture and hold, and a variety of rotating modes (such as Mei's Snowball bonanza, or whatever it's called).

As a shooter, Overwatch requires skill and does a decent job of making each character's weapons feel unique. Each hero has to be played in a different style and has unique abilities that they can activate. Tracer, one of the more extraordinary characters has a teleport ability that can be ""rewound"" to bring you back to her previous position and health.

There are a variety of maps and modes. I found most of the maps easily forgettable. As for modes, the best modes are the generic ones - capture and hold, escort the payload. unfortunately Blizzard decided to grant loot boxes (cosmetic items) if you play their rotating modes. I found myself grinding these maps just to get the cosmetic items (or because friends wanted to get the cosmetic items), but not having any fun doing so. The Mei's snowball mode was probably the best and most interesting (one-shot kills with one-shot ammo) while others, hero mode where all characters are the same hero or one of two heroes, elimination (3v3 in tight quarters), no cool-down mode (self explanatory), all felt gimmicky. I'd much rather have played the main game for loot crates.

I've logged a few hundred hours into Team Fortress 2 and have to say that on a wholly personal level, that TF2 is way more fun. I can't pinpoint what it is exactly but Overwatch's matches lack that fun factor that I found playing TF2. The matches in Overwatch seem calmer than TF2. I found myself much less engaged in the Overwatch matches than a typically TF2 match. It's not a bad game, but it was boring to me. The roster of heroes didn't do enough to make me want to continue playing this and grinding for loot boxes on the rotating maps definitely left me burnt out and not desiring another match.

All in all I give this a 3 star - an ok game.",Underwhelming

B008XMSRKC,3.0,"I watched the video walkthrough first before buying and at the current price found it to be OK to play. The storyline is somewhat different and the idea of changing memories is nice but the controls are not smooth. I noticed that there are delays for some reason while waiting for the software to move. (I am playing on an Xbox 360). For example, the first memory change sequence seemed to not startup. I am pressing buttons and nothing is happening until after a while. Or for example, if the game is trying to tell you to aim, it pauses each time after you get killed and must see the same instructions over and over. One thing the developers should have done...when walking through the city, there are shops and people there but if you approach nothing happens. some open ended games would let you buy items or food etc but in this game it is just window dressing.

B003BYQ79U,3.0,"This Space Shuttle sim has a few major problems.
1. No option for changing screen resolution.
2. No user defined keyboard mapping and very few hot keys & mapped keys. 1992 Shuttle sim had far, far more!
3. Web Based DRM copy protection-can only be used on one machine-should you want to install on a new PC, it requires contacting them for new activation-very user UN-friendly.

Personally, while _some_ of the graphics are better than 1992 Vektor Grafix PC-Dos Shuttle, I find the control panel displays better in the older sim and can certainly read the fonts much better! Much more enjoyable for me too.

B00784HHUM,3.0,"I tried everything, even compatibility mode but on Windows 8 the game won't even install. Is a shame really, I want to play these games so badly.

Update: After almost a year I managed to find a way to install this game on windows 8 thanks to a guy who helped me on the Gamefaqs PC board.

What I did was that I booted my laptop on safe mode and installed both games and it worked! I'm playing KOTOR I right now and the only problem so far is that during some cutscenes the game send me out to the desktop, but all I have to do is click the game icon on the task bar and continue watching the cutscene and then playing. It could be annoying because sometimes there are two or three cutscenes one after another and every time a new cutscene starts it sends you back to the desktop but again just click on the game icon in the task bar to continue playing. I also experience minor lag while playing but that could be my laptop which is not much of a gaming rig but it does handle these old games. Btw, I'm running the game as administrator but not compatibility mode and is working so far. My advice is that at least you run it as an administrator because I heard that if you don't and later in the game you have a problem that only you can fix playing as administrator the save files you made won't appear it you weren't running the game as administrator before. I will beat KOTOR I before playing II, but I tested it and it loaded as well without problem.

I will continue playing and if I run into any problem I will update this review.

Update #2: Another minor problem I found, don't loose when you are using the ship turret because the game then won't load properly and all you will get is a black screen with sound. Find a way to quit and restart the game and reload your last save if this happens. Just finished Tatooine and now I'm on the Wookie home world, so far so good. Will continue updating this review.

Last Update: Those were the only problems I had, I beat the game. Also back up your save files after every playing session, there's a glitch that will delete them, it happened to me.",Doesn't work on Windows 8. (Update: How to install it on W8)

B004UHSGUA,3.0,"Compared to the first Just Cause game, I can safely say that the sequel fixes many of its predecessor's problems and takes the series in the right direction to differentiate itself among other open-world games. Overall, the mechanics and gameplay were well-executed at the expense of the story and mission structure.

Positives: The grappling hook mechanics are far more useful, and this time, you can grab on to pretty much anything close by.  Combined with other stunts like parachuting, tethering, and hijacking, this makes the action sequences a lot more fun.  Unlike San Esperito, the country of Panau feels like a much more dangerous environment, and the excessive military presence won't make the game feel like a cakewalk.  The game finally incorporates regenerating health and upgradable equipment to help make it more approchable.  Just Cause 2 takes a more serious atmosphere this time, so you feel that you are actually on a mission instead of fooling around in a sandbox.  In the first game, you could easily charge through the main story missions, and there was very little incentive to do anything else.  But in this game, you have to earn the ability to progress the main story by doing odd jobs for factions and destroying Panau government property.  This makes the action-filled main story missions feel more rewarding.  The environment is more diverse (although not realistic) and gives a refreshing change of scenery once in a while.  It would have been nice to see more unique locations like the Mile-High Club.

Negatives: Where this game really falls short, like its predecessor, is the story delivery and mission variety.  Most faction missions are very dull, short, and repetitive.  There was a lot of wasted potential for the missions in Panau City.  The game's pace can slow down at times because many faction missions have very little relevance to the main story.  The strategy for overthrowing the dictator in this game is generally accomplished by generating ""chaos"" (through missions and destruction), which is a measure that the game uses to unlock more missions.  This is fine, but you never get the opportunity to actually take over villages or cities like in the first game.  One technical detail that affected gameplay was the unusually high rate at which enemies spawn, which sometimes led to very frustrating situations. The game's story and its anticlimactic ending is unremarkable and stale.  And lastly, the voice acting is atrocious.  Particularly, Tom's character is now extremely exaggerated as the stereotypical All-American who loves succulent pig.

The franchise still has a lot of work to do with AI, story-telling, and exposition.  The sequel has made huge strides in gameplay, so if you enjoyed the first game, you should definitely play this one.","A great sequel, but with lots of wasted potential"

B000K9OR4Q,3.0,"Despite the good and bad reviews, I decided to purchase this game and make my own judgement as to how good/bad it really is. My conclusion is that if you do not learn to controll the sixxaxis, you will not like this game. And in my opinion, I think the patch did little to help the gameplay, I still preffer the original motion sensing.

One thing I do want to point out is that this game can be played on your PSP, by using the Remote Play function. This I think is the only game so far that utilizes this option and is a pretty cool one at that. The graphics will suffer on gameplay, but is not terribly bad to play on the psp nonetheless. Also the controls actually work pretty good.

I do have to say that the cutscenes where more like cutplayscenes cause everytime I was getting into the action my play time was cut by them. This can get a bit annoying because they give you breaks in gameplay more than often.

B00FRESTZW,3.0,"I feel like I'm being a bit generous with three stars, but it does get up there with the gameplay.

Story- (3/5) It was pretty good, I felt like it was intriguing enough to keep me playing all the way through.

Graphics- (1/5) This was one of the more disappointing aspects of the game. The graphics, in my opinion, are god-awful. It's blatantly obvious in one of the very first cutscenes, and throughout the game that graphics were not the developers top priority.

Voice Acting- (2/5) Another issue I had. It. Was. Terrible. It sounded like the actors were TRYING to sound bad.

Gameplay- (4/5) This was truly the only reason why I even remotely liked the game. It had good gameplay. Fighting was extremely fun, it fought kind of like a Batman game, and I got caught up in going around the city just beating people up. There were some glitchy aspects to it, I felt like taking down some airborne enemies was painfully annoying and very troublesome to beat.

After Story- (3/5) Roaming around was pretty fun, it gets boring after a while though and you have to keep doing ""Heroic"" things to not get attacked randomly by over powered enemies. Going to ""live"" events (crime) throughout the city was also okay, but I think it had too many cut scenes when transferring to stopping the crimes. I often found myself sighing and rapidly hitting buttons to skip the cut scenes and get to the action.",Gameplay? Pretty good. Everything else? Not so much.
B00SULMRI4,3.0,"So I'm back on Amazon doing another stick review.  This time it's for the HORI RAP 4 Kai.  This is currently the cheapest current generation stick on the market which makes it worth a look.

Lets start out with the good.  You have a great price point.  With at least $50 less than the competition means that it's going to get some looks.  It has a carrying handle which makes it really easy to transport.  It's a bit lighter than the competition  and definitely has a smaller frame which means you are going to have no problem putting this into specialized bags for sticks are just common backpacks.  The frame is really solid and doesn't feel like it's going to give at all because of the metal frame.  The grip on the bottom of the is nice and makes sure you won't scratch anything the stick is on as well as making sure it won't slide.  The cord length is also great along with the compartment.  Really big and the cord is really easy to store.

Now lets move to the bad.  Unlike the other two sticks in the compassion currently this stick is not easily opened.  The other thing is once you open up this stick you void the warranty.  The buttons aren't really as good as the competitions but they aren't horrible.  They are also easily replaced.  The lever is about the same.  The only thing that is bad about it is that it's harder to change the gate.  The Hayabusa lever has the gate screwed in and it's a lot bigger than a Sanwa gate.  You can put a Sawna octagon gate in it's place and usually it stays.  It just doesn't clip or screw into place.  Some people will not be happy with the base of the stick because it's not as wide as the others so there is a smaller place to rest your hands.  Also in the inside there is a lot of glue, so it's harder to change out wires or see what wires go where because there is glue over the labels.  Last thing is that space isn't at a premium with this stick so you won't be able to add things in as easily.

All in all this stick is a decent stick.  Especially at the price point. I would say if you have the money you should get the T.E.2.  If you don't this is a stick that will work and you can always swap out everything to sanwa parts to improve the performance.","Good budget stick, not mod friendly"
B007CSF3GO,3.0,"It's a decent rpg, and worth the price, but didn't really stand out for me.

* All of the characters are annoying jerks. I didn't care if they lived or died.
* The voice acting is not good. After the first few scenes I put the voice volume on 0, which helped a lot, though for some cut scenes the game turned the volume back up. That was disappointing.
* The music was okay. Not particularly memorable. It's mostly ambient, and lots of minor keys. It sounds like something from Shadow of the Colossus. I'm a huge Nobuo Uematsu fan and was hoping for something of his older style, like classical music with a rock beat, but instead it's formless and depressing.
* The main enemies are generic and forgettable. Some really interesting mini-boss monsters though.
* The combat system is mind numbingly simple. You basically just press in the direction of an enemy. You can win most battles without pressing any buttons. For harder battles, you have to do a little more, but it's still mostly effortless.",Not bad

B000O5I0F8,3.0,"At first glance, Ultimate Mortal Kombat is an arcade-perfect port of the original game.  But as with most handheld fighters, it reveals itself to only be a visual achievement and a technological anomaly.

What sets UMK apart from other DS fighters is that instead of onscreen buttons that activate your character's special moves, the touch screen provides a very specific command list for that character.  The problem with this is if you mess with the button configurations to suit your own style, and if your attack buttons don't match those on the command list, you'll miss even the simplest techniques while getting pummeled by the game's unforgiving AI.  You'd think the programmers would list a special move as ending with HP or HK instead of A or B.

Unlocking the game's hidden goodies isn't a picnic either.  First you end the game after losing a whole match and then enter the cheat code using a weird slot system within 10 seconds.  But most of the unlockables are just arenas, so no biggie.

Also ported from Mortal Kombat: Deception, Puzzle Kombat is an easy-to-play-hard-to-master mini game in the same vein as Super Puzzle Fighter, but with Midway's personal touches all over it.  I actually see myself playing this as much as, if not more than UMK; not a good sign.

B00IIHU44E,3.0,"Out of all of the Xbox One games I've played, Titanfall is probably the most fun.  However the game is not all it is cracked up to be.  It is pretty much a multi-player only game, and it doesn't do a whole lot to differentiate itself from other online shooters.  It's a good game don't get me wrong.  Maybe it was just all of the hype that caused my expectations to be high.  This game was hyped up to be revolutionary, but it's more evolutionary in my opinion, and the game itself doesn't have a whole lot of substance or value.

With that said, considering it's essentially free (over 16GB download) the overall package is pretty decent.  Just hope you don't get a unit like my launch unit where the disc drive made grinding noises.  Fortunately my replacement unit works fine so far.

Another alternative is the PC version if you have a decent system.  It doesn't require much -- a mid-range build will run it with better framerates and better image quality than Xbox One.  I have played both versions and the Xbox One's framerate dips into the 40's a lot of the time, and sometimes even into the 30's (look at Digitalfoundry at eurogamer).  The framerate was much on the PC I was playing on, which was running a Radeon R7 250x ($100) and a FX-6300 CPU ($120); running at 900p with similar settings to the Xbox One.  Framerate is important in a 'twitch' shooter like this.

I also found that the PC version was a bit less buggy than the Xbox One version.  There were a few times where the game was briefly a slide show.  Fortunately this didn't happen during any battles and it was quite rare.  Seeing as how a few reviewers mentioned this (ie Giant Bomb), apparently I'm not alone.","Decent bundle, fun game"

B01GWTYXSC,3.0,"I've tried quite a few headphones for gaming on my PS4 and my desktop, and these are an interesting concept with some pros and cons.

The first main pro is the feel of the build quality.  The metal, the stitching on the head cushion, the volume wheel, the 3.5mm cord all feel as nice and solid as any headphones I've ever used, and are nicer than my Sony headphones that cost 4 times as much.  If you plan on being seen in your headphones, these are a nice choice, and if you're the kind of person who really likes aesthetics, these are a good option for you.

Having to recharge with a usb cable is an acceptable hassle for cordless headphones.  These of course aren't cordless.  The cord is shorter than my other similar headphones, but when attached to your dualshock controller it can be nice to have less cord in your way.  But that kinda gets to the problem: these still have that cord in your way.  If you want less cord in your way and don't mind recharging headphones, you can get wireless headphones, often with surround sound, for a similar price to these.

These have a beautiful sound, and I suppose that's the most important feature.  They aren't as loud as 40mm headphones should be, and I think that helps avoid distortion.  I think anyone wanting louder headphones will eventually have hearing loss.  The boom mike sounds much better than the in-built mike, but this is mainly news for phone calls.  If you're chatting in games, the audio quality is going to be low no matter how nice the mike is.  Having the extra mike is a good idea.

At the end of the day, these are competing against gaming headphones that look and feel cheap in comparison, but have far more features and I'd say convenience.  Once you've used surround sound headphones for games, it's hard to downgrade, and wireless headphones are just more comfortable all around.  The three stars reflect what I consider to be an average value.  Great sound and great finish on a product that does less stuff for the money.

If you don't want wireless, or if you really want that quality feel, these are still a viable choice.","Sound good, but for gaming headphones you need to consider the pros and cons"
B006476322,3.0,"I am not a hardcore gamer, and due to neck surgery, I don't always have full control of my fingers, so I don't particularly care for the default style of play (particularly when it comes to pitching; my fingers shake too much to be accurate).  There isn't a manual included--or at least, I've never been able to find one--and I'm puzzled by some of the things that appear on the screen, again mostly during pitching.  I was able to switch to a classic control, but the menus are hardly intuitive and it took some time to be able to maneuver through them.

That said, the graphics are outstanding, and 2K sports has done a fine job of capturing the nuances of each player's batting and pitching motions.  There is the ability to fine tune the game to your ability, even in game, which is outstanding.  There are just stats upon stats that even sabermatricians will love.

I'm addicted to the ""my player"" feature. Recommend this game.

EDIT:  I previously loved this game.  However, due to the ""MLB Today"" feature that loads as soon as you start the game, I cannot get the game past the title screen.  Why?  Because 2K Sports didn't think ahead to the days there wouldn't be any games.

There are workarounds online that include back-dating your system to one of the last days of the regular season in order to start the game.  When you are able to play this game is great; it is simply frustrating that a lack of foresight has caused so many issues.

B00IFRH6JS,3.0,"This turned out to be an excellent gaming mouse. I had finally worn out my aging MS Sidewinder gaming mouse which I was afraid I'd never like another type but this one is better! Controls are perfect. Feel is excellent. It looks a bit cheesy but it performs like a $60 mouse.

EDIT### 03/22/2015

 Well sadly the little mouse died. Here is the deal... it has cheap micro-switches that are sprung with flat, copper plated contact springs. It basically uses the spring to complete the circuit. The spring for left click relaxed to the point the mouse was unusable. I took it apart to understand the failure and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of everything EXCEPT the switches. They are the point of failure and will fail eventually with daily use. If you buy this mouse, buy 2. You will need the 2nd to use while you shop it's replacement.",Great mouse and a bargain too... but you get what you pay for
B001HKPUKC,3.0,"I have finally finished this game and it is average to slightly above average.  If the Wii is the only system you have it is still one of the better games on the system.  The game is average because of the problems.

First,

I was able to shoot enemies through doors.  On one part I just walked through the door and backed back through and let the door shut.  The enemies came to the door and I could see their head through the door and shot them.  I was at one section were I shot multiple enemies through the cover they were behind.  This happened in many places.

Second,

The enemies are dumb.  They will run out in front of you a lot and just stand there for a few seconds while you wipe them out.

Third,

The game is not very challenging even on the highest setting.  With the dumb AI and the ability to get enemies in situations were you can shoot them through the doors and the walls/objects it take some challenge away.

Lastly,

The online is not near as good as i was hearing or expected.  I have never experienced connection problems with any other game or even when downloading games and software.  But i played online for a while and noticed that you could unload 2 clips into another player as they charged in for a melee kill with one hit.  I caught on and tried it and sure enough.  Just charge in and melee and you will 9 times out of 10 win.

That is what i thought was wrong with the game.  Now, for what i liked.

I thought the controls were pretty good and responded very well.  The graphics are not bad at all and things look like they are suppose to with the detail needed to make things out.  The story isn't to bad if you like this kind of story.  And the enemies keep coming, out of the portals so you are forced to push forward and close them, or out of egg pods that you have destroy to stop the growth of new enemies.  And although the problems above were apparent I still enjoyed the game as it was fun and the online can be fun with friends.

All together i recommend this game for the Wii owner.  Without the problems i would have given the game a 5-star as it is really fun.  So, if you can look past the problems definitely get this game.",Average

B00FYJ0I6S,3.0,"Ok,

So I own just about all major MadCatz fight stick releases. I was expecting big things with this bad boy, and didn't mind paying $200 for the fight stick.

Pro's: Its pretty, and big which I like some may not. The LED back lighting is bright again some may not like. The level of access to the guts and art work is 2nd to none. The card is long, and can be store inside pretty easy. However, to detach from fight stick you have to unscrew it.

Con's: THE CORD NEEDS TO BE UNSCREWED.... seems like no big deal, but the actual process sucks. Why no one in their R&D said ahhh guys this is pretty dumb lets remove it. So I do not bother removing the damn this and it just dangles there. However, that is not my biggest issues with this fight stick. What is I paid $200 for it, and I expected fit and finish to be as good or if not better then the previous TE sticks. The latch where the top locks has play on it, and when you rest your hands and play the game you feel/hear the clicking and flex of the plastic. Opening the case revealed lots of room unused for proper padding, so that this play could be eliminated. I used some packing foam inside it, and seems to remedy the issues. So yeah, can't put the cord away process sucks, and the ability to open it well....god so pissed.

I really am enjoying the game, and having the fight stick has made the experience better, but the fit and finish of this thing sucks. I called MadCatz to see if this was a issue of my actual unit, and I was told that its the way it is so yeah not sure what we can tell you. If the bending of the plastics don't bother you, or that the latch never really locks buy it. Otherwise, wait for a revision or different model. I am hearing a lot of custom stick builders are making the now, so I would go that route instead.",Sub par fit and finish.

B000UU5T7E,3.0,"It surprises me that in spite of all the obvious TLC that went into Fallout 3, no one in Bethesda thought to give it decent storyline. Interesting characters introduced at the beginning of the game will never be heard from again. Your rivaling faction will get in your way maybe twice, then simply disappear after a ho-hum fireworks show. And, to add insult to injury, the game doesn't even have an end-boss. That's right, all that leveling and gun-tuning won't mean a damned thing in the final chapter of Fallout 3 - you'll be fighting trash mobs from the beginning of the game to the end of it. Don't bother saving those Mini Nukes.

What a shame. Underneath the narrative, there is a time consuming and entertaining video game in Fallout 3. The mechanics of combat are so fun, that I actually looked forward to enemy combat (whereas in too many RPGs I find myself dreading it). There's lots of great weaponry, towns, characters, monsters, and items. The side-quests are often fairly engaging and satisfying. The gameplay is open-ended (for the most part), and runs smoothly on my mid-low range laptop.

But what good is it all in a game that is so driven by a narrative that could pass as a poorly written fan fiction?

Overall good, but frustratingly disappointing.",Sugar in the fuel lines.
B00LMRL00O,3.0,"This controller came with my Nvidia Shield TV. After using  the PlayStation 4 Dualshock 4 controller, this one left a lot to be desired. It is very bulky, almost unnecessarily so. The touch-buttons sometimes give me issues where they stop becoming responsive, and they are hard to locate without looking at the controller; would have much preferred real buttons instead. The bottom of the controller has a small touchpad, but as of May 2016 it has still been left completely disabled by the system due to software issues; basically the touch pad doesn't work at all, you might as well just forget it's there. The volume control buttons were a good idea though and I use them a lot. The analog sticks feel too tall and have too large a range; playing a game like Inferno 2 where you are controlling entirely with the thumb sticks gets tiring because you have to throw the sticks so far back and forth constantly.

The rest of the buttons are satisfactory. The biggest issue I find is that the button mappings in apps are not always standard or clear so I often find myself completely confused on how I'm supposed to navigate and control different app; this is more of an issue with the apps though.",Not perfect but no too bad

B0016BVYAM,3.0,"The original BioShock was a breath of fresh air for me when I played it about three years ago. The combination of an unorthodox presentation, a unique setting, and non-derivative gameplay mechanics made it, in my mind, one of the best games of all time. Certainly, it had some flaws, but was, and still is, an instant classic.

Now, almost three years after the original, Take Two has decided to create a sequel out of the game, after seeing how financially successful it was.

The sequel takes place in 1970, ten years after the events of the original game. Andrew Ryan is dead, and now, a collectivist called Sofia Lamb is ruling what remains of Rapture, attempting to culture a socialist utopia out of the previously capitalist Rapture that Ryan created. The protagonist is a Big Daddy called ""Delta"", and he is trying to search for his daughter, Eleanor, who was once a Little Sister.

What gripes me most about this game is how unchanged most of the game is, in comparison with the original. Sure, they may have introduced some new enemies (like the Big Sister) and some new weapons (like the Rivet Gun), but by and all, the core gameplay remains unchanged. Even the level design is more or less the same. You are thrust down a linear pathway, and unlike the first game, you never get the opportunity to revisit areas you have cleared out previously. It's still all good and fun, but I feel that 2K Marin could have done a much better job at creating a real sequel, instead of merely recyling old assets from the first game into a new game that they call a ""sequel"".

There is multiplayer as well, featuring ranks and unlockable weapons/plasmids as you level up, but it feels very tacked-on and obviously is not the reason why most people are buying this game. Furthermore, there are no dedicated servers either, since BioShock 2 uses Games for Windows Live for matchmaking.

And finally, I would like to say a little something about the DRM. There are two types of DRM in this game: SecuROM, and Games for Windows Live. SecuROM is used for the physical DRM (i.e., you need the disk in the drive to launch the game) and GFWL validates the game via a product key to unlock achievements and multiplayer for the player. I don't find SecuROM to be much of a hassle (you can always use a no-DVD crack to bypass the disk check), but I do have a problem with GFWL, since you can only activate the game 15 times before you have to call Microsoft for more activations. I find this atrociously anti-consumer and a complete hassle for those of us who reformat often. That said, I don't seriously find the DRM used in the game to be a major problem as a whole, but the whole limited activations thing is a joke and simply inconviences the end user in the long run.

Overall, I give this game a 3/5. It's fun, but worth only $20-$25 at best.","BioShock 2 - Derivative and uninspired, but still fun."

I was particularly impressed with the storytelling, graphics, interface, and actual game play.  I am a huge KOTOR fan and this fits so well into those story lines.

However, I became bored with the game a few months in because there is only one story line characters can follow.  While each class has their own individual missions, all characters must travel to the same planets in the same order and the story lines on each planet are the same time and time again.

They are very similar to what thq has done on the previous UFC games so you will be able to pick them up quickly if you have played those in the past. The problem is they are less intuitive and responsive. This game does weird things like for instance counterpunching is pointless. you can sidestep and work a jab but the computer will still throw some spin kick strait through it. The only way it works is to use the perry system then counter which defeats the purpose. The stamina system makes no sense is unrealistic. The submission system is soo bad I usually don't even pay attention to the actual submission my character is doing. Judging is worse than real life to the point that the winner just seems like random selection.  It is not all bad , the game looks amazing.

Pros - the game is easy to jump right into and play right off the start. No need to learn any new fighting styles (e.g. - Wither 2)and many of the commands are very similar to all of the other sandbox/RPG games out there.  The story line is pretty good, the ability to quick save is great.  Also the game loads very fast and each level is quite small so it is very easy to move from one end to the other.

Cons - i'ts not the best looking game ever, the AI isn't very smart and the developer uses the same crates, lockers, boxes, plants, computers, monitors, doors and people throughout the entire game.

This game has strict limitations about the PC hardware it runs on.

I suppose this game would have been good if we had been able to get it installed in any of our 3 laptop PCs.  All in all an HP with Windows XP, Acer with Vista and a brand new Acer Windows 7 (bought significantly after this game was released) none were able to run it, we tried everything.

My husband picked this game more than a year ago for about twice the prize.  I wouldn't have bought it, period.  I like Half-Life (1 and 2) storyline too much and was pleased with the versatility it offered (and the compatibility was the widest I've seen).  He had just bought a brand new laptop at the time, and thought it would work.

I read the specs and let him know that sadly it needs 2.3 GHz processor and his laptop had 2.1GHz.  I also told him it called for an NVIDIA card which he did not have.  He tried it in his older HP laptop which did have an NVIDIA card, but the speed was 1.8GHz so it would not work either.

He told me that he liked the game so much that he would be willing to wait a year to get a new laptop.  One year passed and around February I needed a new laptop but the game was the last thing on my mind, and mind you, the game wouldn't have made a difference in my decision.  I wanted the latest technology for web, but at the same time didn't want to spend more that $600.  So I got myself an Acer 2.3GHz.

Hubby of course said to me ""Hey! let's check to see if Fallout 3 works on it""!!!

I wasn't trilled - 5GB on a game I didn't even care for, but WHO on earth would say NO to their hubby?  Well, again we were installing and uninstalling ""Pandora boxes"" into my brand new laptop trying to get it to work.  Misleading reviews and fan sites lead us to believe that ""Yes, it will work, but you need..."" blah blah blah

No it didn't work even after installing everything we were told.  We even uninstalled Nero and ANY CD burning software (there were rumors that CD burning programs would scramble the installation of the game).  Further investigation revealed that most ""serious"" gamers wouldn't even buy this to run on a laptop.  They said ""if you're a gamer, stick to desktops, laptops are junk for games""... we found eventually that any laptop able to run this game would cost no less than $1000 (and this was one year+ after the game was originally released)!

This reminds me of the old DOS games, even when you had the right equipment you had to go through hoops choosing the right drivers and memory settings.  I see that we weren't the only ones who had trouble trying to get this game to run, all over the web all you see is ""trying to run fallout 3"", ""fallout 3 won't run"", ""fallout 3 crash on start-up"", and other similar ordeals.

I believe game installation, specifications and mechanics are equally as important as the game-play.  What good is a game that you shelve after you play, then when you decide to install it a year later to re-play it you have to activate a millions libraries you do not need?  Or find that your new computer won't run it?  What if you do not have the money for the right computer?

Since I am not a desktop computer user, this just won't do.  Surprising though, in the Mac platform, any Mac game released BEFORE a computer is released works with the newer equipment, usually without flaws.  Simple as that.",Technical specs?

Pro - Lots of different ways to play, you can play tournaments, or practice, putting challenges, and you have to get birdie badges.  Con - Usually Mario is the bomb guy, but in this game he's a really bad golfer :}  But overall, this is a good game, that a five year old can play, so go out and get your copy today!

B00275A7LI,3.0,"I've been a big fan of the R&C games since the first.  With the lone exception of Deadlocked, I've loved every single one of them.  A Crack In Time is a very good game, don't get me wrong, but there just seemed to be something missing.  The weapons weren't as much fun as others in the series.  My biggest complaint is that the game just seemed short to me.  This is a growing frustration for me with this generation of gaming.  It seems that every game has to have an online multiplayer component, which usually comes at the price of sacrificing the length of the single-player mode.

This is one of the reasons why I stick with Playstation over the Xbox 360.  Playstation console usually has stronger single-player games, where the 360 is more online multiplayer focused.  To each his own, but I don't get into online gaming.  Unfortunately, a number of my favorite franchises have gone downhill because the developers feel they have to focus on online.  If this trend continues with R&C, this just may be the last one I buy.",A bit disappoiting

B00D3RBYM0,3.0,"The graphics on this game are stunning.  The driving is fun.  The challenges are exciting.  The overall gameplay is highly enjoyable -- so why only 3 stars?  Because there are several technical issues which make this game frustrating.

First, games can spontaneously end when the leader goes offline, then you are stuck waiting for the system to connect you to another server.  Most of the time you can play for hours without interruption, but I've had it bounce me between servers 3 times in an hour.  This can become so frustrating that I just want to turn off the game -- never a good sign.

Second, Kinect voice commands -- ugh.  These are very helpful in some cases.  For example, you can say ""GPS Repair Shop"" and it will instantly map you a course to the closest repair shop.  Unfortunately, there are other far more useless commands which are not only helpful, but make it difficult to control the car!  If you say anything that sounds the Kinect hears as ""look around"" the camera will spin around your car, making it impossible to steer.  Saying anything about looking behind, or rear, will cause the camera to look behind you.  Anything that sounds like ""change view"" will move your view from floating behind the car to inside the car... There appear to be several different commands for the different view changes, and I have not found anyplace that lists these or tells you how to disable them.  This forces me to play in silence because saying something as simple as ""Really?!"" sends the camera into a spin.  The only way to disable the voice commands is to unplug the Kinect.",Could be great... but it's not.
B0009PAUJM,3.0,"This game was so over hyped it even got a behind the scenes show on g4tv. Now I wanted 2 play this game cuz well, I being an xbox owner, wanted a good romp like god of war since I already finished ninja gaiden. This game leaves me feeling; like something is missing... it could have been so much more. Let me give u my reviews.

Graphics 7/10:They focused on cramming a huge amount of enemies on screen at the same time which is cool sometimes but when u look at the cut scenes and bland areas. YUCK is this really xbox?. But it's not totally horrid.

Sound 7.5/10: When I listen to the excellence god of war soundtrack and ninja gaiden's soundtrack I can't help but think the corny rock tracks playing here was jus tacked on. The weapon sounds are nice clangs and clashes. Then we get to the voice acting um no no this simply will not do. These have got 2 be the worse directed voice acting ever.

Game play: Well as much as they hyped it 2 be it's just a basic hack and slasher, which is fine if u like that genre. The weapons in the game although are pretty cool... they jus don't seem 2 carry any real weight with them. I mean when I play the other top 2 action adventure games, ninja gaiden and god of war I really do feel like I'm causing bodily harm 2 folks. The action in Spartan jus feels real muted. The tons of enemies are cool...but when they all surround u alone and u can't find a power up it becomes frustrating.

Control 5/10: The controls are adequate u got ur light slash and heavy. But The bow control is totally wack!! The camera is controlled by the right thumb stick which I personally don't like 2 much cuz it can become disorienting. The overall control feels like it's stuck between pc mouse control and console controller style... I don't like it that much.

All in all if it seems like I keep bringing up Ninja Gaiden and God of War.... I must use them 2 compare, because those are now the measuring stick by which these games will all be compared, ESPECIALLY Ninja Gaiden. I understand they were trying the huge battles and what not...which I think is real cool. But it could have been better in other departments.",did not live up 2 the hype
B008ZXBYJU,3.0,"The GOOD:
-Grip feels nice and comfortable as long as you are NOT reaching for L or R buttons (see ""the bad"").
-Holds 2 additional 3DS games in the back.
-Can be used as a nice stand if you view videos on your 3DS (NintendoV, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu).
-Prevents ""poking"" of headphone jack when laying unit on your chest/belly to play games.  Dumb point I know, but it's actually more comfortable from that alone.

THE BAD:
- Reaching for L/R buttons makes the unit almost neglible.  For my hands at least, it is not fleshed ""wide"" enough to make this comfortable.  A fair term would be ""less annoying, but still not comfortable"".
-total DOH moment: it blocks the stylus!!  Luckily i can get by with finger for most games but if i were to throw Metroid Prime Hunters in, i'd be kicking myself (or trying to figure out where to put my stylus so i don't lose it when the phone rings).

THE VERDICT:
-ok buy, a cheaper price would make ""the bad"" negligible.  I would shop around first and minimally make sure your stylus won't be blocked however.",Is ok but only SLIGHTLY improves grip

B0014ULQDA,3.0,"Read the reviews which weren't that great, but I liked the games that were included in this.  Guess I now have to agree with a lot of those reviews.  The Bocce ball is fun, but the manual didn't explain all the moves you can make.  Just kinda discovered those by fussing with the controls.  The volleyball is just flicking the remote.  Not much to that.  Still haven't figured out what I'm actually doing in soccer.  I win every time, but have no idea how.  Obviously doesn't take any skill to play.  Disc Golf was the same.  Flicked the remote and it went into the basket every time.  Didn't even aim, but it went in every time.  Am afraid to play cricket since I already don't know how to play that, much less on the Wii.

B00163ROMW,3.0,"Positive: + excellent graphics + some of the POW moves are really cool + the Sonic universe is portrayed well +

Negative: - dreadful camera - battle system could use some help - pretty boring - poor sound effects - annoying enemies - Big the Cat! -

Sonic is in desperate need of a great game. Sure the Sonic Rush series has been doing well, but he still needs some kind of huge success to get him back on his feet. In an attempt to bring about that desirable future, BioWare has brought Sonic into the wonderful world of RPG's in Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood. Does it succeed in bringing our beloved hedgehog back or does it only put him in more desperate need of revival?

Sonic Chronicles starts off by having you rescue Knuckles, who was captured by the Marauders when they invaded the earth. Upon finding Knuckles, you befriend Eggman and proceed to infiltrate the Marauder's headquarters. And that's as far as I got before I got sick of the game and started writing this review. The story didn't seem too bad but I couldn't bring myself to play it enough to find out how it ends, or progresses, for that matter.

Being an RPG, Sonic Chronicles naturally relies heavily on its battles for gameplay. In these battles you get to use four characters at once, which is cool. There are quite a few characters too but to change your party you have to go all the way back to your `base of operations' (so to speak, the first of these is Tails' place), and this is pretty annoying.

The battles progress in rounds: you tell each of your characters what to do, then you watch them do it. Unless you have them do a POW move, in which case you will have to drag or tap circles with good timing to execute the move right. This way of doing the attacks is pretty fun and easy to learn, and overall it's not bad. There are many attacks that use combinations of two to four characters, and despite the fact that they can be really cool, they're not always worth doing as they take a turn and the amount of PP from each character involved.

One annoying thing about the battles is that your characters miss too much, and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it. Another gripe I have is about the enemies, I mean do I really enjoy fighting enemies that come back to life all the time? There are way too many self-regenerating enemies in the game that come back unless they are the last enemies you defeat in the battle, and they don't stop coming back until you end it. Too long!

Enough about the battles, now let's talk about the gameplay outside of battle. Well, actually, I'd rather not... but for the sake of a review I will reminisce. The first thing I noticed about the bird's-eye view gameplay is just how AWFUL and DREADFUL the camera is! It is CONSTANTLY shifting and shaking, not to make you lose track of your character (thankfully) but it does make my eyes hurt when I play it for very long. This is definitely one of the big problems with the game.

There are puzzles to solve outside of battle too. These involve you moving your characters around on switches to get to the next area! Uh... woo hoo? That's what I thought. Not much fun. Then there are the characters' abilities, which are good and bad. Tails' flying is fine, Knuckles' climbing is ok, and the power ability is neat, and thankfully everyone can JUMP, but what's up with Big the Cat? Why did they bother putting poison gas in the game? So they could annoy you by making Big the only character that can walk through it? Let me know if you think of a better reason.

On a more positive note, the graphics in Sonic Chronicles are excellent, maybe some of the best on the DS. They're super smooth (except when the camera is shifting) and the cel-shade effect makes the game look REALLY nice and clean.

Unfortunately not all the technical aspects of The Dark Brotherhood are good: the sound and music could use some help. The sound effects range from the classic Sonic sounds we all love to a ""BOING!"" when you kill an enemy... yeah, that's what I want to hear when I fight bad guys in a video game. The characters also make funky sounds when they get hit. The music isn't necessarily bad; it just isn't very good either. There's not much to describe in that section.

Overall, Sonic Chronicles isn't a bad game... it's just not very good either. It earns enough merit to make some people like it, but there's also enough bad stuff in it that can make people (like me) really not enjoy it. So I personally recommend you pass this one up, but you there's a chance you would enjoy it. All the potential the game has seemed to go to waste, and if there's a sequel I expect a LOT more.

Gameplay: 6.5

B003S55EWS,3.0,"For a game that was trumped as supposedly being superior to the original it's really not that much better except with more characters. But when so many of them play the same what does it even matter.

Graphics wise it looks ok, but nothing significantly better then the last one, but at least the camera seems to be a little less broken.

Ultimately their isn't too much wrong with the game, but unless you're a big fan of Dragon ball you're going to get board of it fairly quickly. 3/5 stars",For Fans only
B002DC8GKO,3.0,"The biggest thing you need to know about this product is that there is absolutely

NO Online community.  The PSN crash last spring doomed this game, well that and the lackluster gameplay.

You can only start a game with those who are your level or higher, so lower level players can't be added

to your session until they search for you.  I think a little more gore would've made this a more enjoyable

killing experience; there's not much realism, and you just feel like you're knocking down sterile, lifeless bots.

The framerate's decent, only hiccuping occassionally.  The environments are flush with color, but lacking in definition.

There's not alot of value (light/darkness) gradation, so when you walk into a dark corner, it seems really messed up.

There are alot of ways to play in the world of Brink, but you may become frustrated when you're unable to accomplish

your goals.  I don't think I'll ever pass a couple levels, because they're so hard.  If I were playing with people online,

it may be possible, but the AI is designed to dominate during certain points.  It really is useless to have a customizable

character, since this is a 1st person game, and I haven't seen a soul online in weeks.  Despite the gaming community's gripes

with this garbage game, I would how ever recommend Brink to those who like to mix things up.  There's a short variety

of guns to choose from, but once you see the best one and know your personal preference (rifle, smg, pistol or shotty),

there's no need to use the others, unless you want to handicap yourself.  I was suprised to learn that weapon attachments

are ONLY earned after completing challenge courses.  In summary, the designers of Brink chose to concentrate on character,

skill and weapon customization instead of creating bad-ass gameplay (a real mistake).","Skinned knees @ release, never got itself up off the ground."

B00G3TV6Q4,3.0,"sort of a meh for me. these little rubber grips are too soft in my opinion. getting them on takes a fair amount of effort, and once on the pretty readily slip right off again. the plastic is more slippery than the rubber that is already on the PSV nubs so they effectively made my grip worse.",they are just meh.
B017S3OPZM,3.0,"I bought this game since I loved the demo and it got great reviews. Plus, several YouTubers that I follow also gave this game good recomendations. However, it is not as great to me as I was lead to believe.

The graphics look like something from the PS3. They aren't bad, but they just look like great graphics for a last gen console. It alnost feels like this game was supposed to be one of the last games released for PS3, but then at the last minute revised to be on PS4.

Controls are a mixed bag. There are multiple different styles of play mashed into one here. It will go from a twin stick style shooter, to a shoot em up, to an action platformer, to a 3rd person God of Waresque style, and so on. The camera is fixed for most of these as well. It works most of the time but during boss battles this creates unneeded frustration and added difficulty that shouldn't be there.

The save system is old school. It can be cool and add an element of strategy to the game. However, there are plenty of times as well where you'll long for the standard of automatic saves during long stretches of level design that can be infuriating the further into the game you get.

Customization of skills, weapons and items are pretty bland here. It was confusing to me as well trying to craft and upgrade just about everything.

Story is pretty weird. I guess if you love traditional Japanese JRPG story lines you might like this. I found the characters pretty weak and uninspiring, too.

If you're seeing all of these 4 and 5 star reviews and you're thinking this is a slam dunk game to add to your collection, please do so with caution. For me there are plenty of other titles out there that are plenty more fun than this title. This game tries to do a lot and for the most part it does all of them to a satisfactory level. I recommend this game if you plan on spending far less than initial asking price. After spending about 6 hours on this title I knew it wasn't for me.",Just another average action RPG
B00Z7V9P8K,3.0,"I'm actually very disappointed in this game.  Does it look good, yes, is the combat engaging, yes, is the story well done...sorta... But you get to drive the Batmobile right?  ...well, about that...
For a certain kind of player this game would be great, but I think the game suffers from two very big problems, possible three, but I'll get to that.
Problem #1:  the car/tank/thing.  So the Batmobile is iconic, no doubt and at first the driving mechanic is pretty sweet, but then...well it turns into a gimmick, and not a very good one at that.  Three of the boss battles that should have been epic hand to hand brawls like then the previous Arkham games are reduced to little more than aggravating races and/or a game of Battle Tanks.  Now don't get me wrong a game of Battle Tanks is great, but not in my Batman game.  Sorry big fail.
Problem #2:  the setting is far, far too big.  Now for many this isn't a problem, and with the games that are out these days with massive open world maps the map of Batman does seem a bit quaint in comparison.  But I don't play these games for sprawling maps,  I play for the story, for the iconic characters.  Now is Gotham's three islands a great set piece, absolutely, but there are to many things here that fall under problem #1.  All the car stuff gets repetitive and either boring or infuriating, and I don't want to play a game that makes me mad!  I want to have fun in this big Batman world.
Problem #3:  The main story.  I'm sorry but anyone who knows anything about Batman's lore knows who the Arkham Knight is from his first line of dialog.  The cut scenes get to be overwhelming or in some cases very underwhelming.  Now don't get me wrong, it's a big world so there's a lot of stuff to do and many, many bad guys to go after.  The story is predictable, some of the character elements were done well, and Mark Hamill's Joker has never been better acted.  The voices and the look of the game are very solid, but in the end I actually preferred all the character based side missions as apposed to the main story.  The side stories, including the DLC are great, but the main story isn't really something I enjoy.  One exception to the side missions...the Riddler, my god, the Riddler missions...  The first game was great, the second and third games were great, but this one...dear lord there are so many things to do with this green-wearing goofball and that mission, above and beyond all others is why once I finished the game, even though there is a new game + feature, I put it on the shelf and said never again.  It's just not worth replaying.

In my humble if long-winded opinion, a game should be fun to pick up and play and you should be able to complete missions with relative ease, nothing that will make you grind you teeth like some of these missions will.  And again much of it boils back to problem #1.  I heard a rumor they were going to make a new game, if that is true I hope they do not include the Batmobile and get back to something that looks a little more like the first three games as far as story.  And maybe just for one game either remove the Riddler or have him be the main bad guy, since his stuff is always the thing you have to finish last anyway.","It's ok, but there are some serious problems..."
B00005QIQM,3.0,"If you are looking for a classic game for a really good price, this is one. It takes place in World War 2, you get to shoot Nazi's and complete mission with historically accurate World War 2 gear. The graphics are dated, but the game it old. The missions are simple, but the enemies are super-human. They can spot you through fog and walls, but do not worry patch 1.3 will resolve that, the real kicker is that on Vista it will play up to level 3, but when you try to go to into level 3 the program crashes at the load screen. I have a feeling that it is relevant to Direct X, but I am not able to confirm it.

Also a jump function would have been nice to get over small logs or blades of grass that are to tall ha ha. They could have done without the fishing in the game because it is a little cheesy. But overall it is still pretty fun. Hope this helps,Not bad
B000K9OR4Q,3.0,"A bit disappointed. I really loved the idea of using the 6 axis controller to control the dragons flight, but I found it to be lacking and slow to respond. Also some times the game did not recognize my controller movements and the dragon did not fly as I was directing it too by moving my controller. I really hope that this is the first of many game to be like this and in the future the response to controller movement will just get better with time.",Great Idea on paper.. not so good in real world

B00KY1HZ62,3.0,"I'll go into this review admitting that I'm punishing this game somewhat for not being Raging Blast 2.  It IS a vast improvement over Ultimate Tenkaichi and Battle of Z.  And I mean vast.  First and most glaring plus is the fresh take on the story.  DBZ games have caught a lot of flak over the years for rehashing the same story over and over again (though considering the manga has been done for over a decade there's only so much ye can do).  In this one ye get to create a custom character in an interesting way and plug them with supers and ultimates, change wardrobe, etc etc. The interface is actually kind of fun once ye get the hang of it (I still have a bad habit of constantly going the opposite direction of what I want within Toki Toki City and have to basically run through the whole thing.  In all the game seems to be a condensed console version of the Dragon Ball Online game that came out in Asia, which I consider to be a good thing since that seemed interesting.
For the bad, The graphics are good but a bit overdone for my tastes.  The power curve of the AI is frustratingly inconsistent.  Level grinding can be maddeningly tedious.  The play controls are manageable but not what I would call good.  Of course, here is where I MAY be guilty of needlessly punishing it for not being RB2 since that game had, in my opinion, the best fighting system.  Parts of the combat in this game seem to be like ""well we can't just borrow the play controls for that other game, we have to be different for the sake of being different!""  It turns out to be a rather big deal because this game REALLY suffers for it.  There is no reliable homing dash so ye run into this problem of either plodding slowly up to yer opponent or trying to use the dash function and blowing past them.  Ki Charging is a special technique itself rather than just being a separate function.  Super Saiyan transformations only last as long as ye have energy to fuel it and ye drop out of it when ye get to 0.  I mean honestly if Dimps had just used the fighting system from their own Budokai games while just making it an over the shoulder fighter it would have been MUCH better.  I flat out don't understand alot of the decisions made with the play controls in this game.  Also alot of the function of the game seems dependent on connecting to the Xenoverse server, which at this point in time is kinda a crap shoot as to whether it's working or not.  Since I rarely use the online functions in games I'm not counting this against it, and it'll probably get better later on, but for others this might be a problem.
In conclusion, I gave this game 3 stars because unlike the previous two offings it's not an unplayable mess.  I found the new story functions to be interesting and the character creator to be a fun aspect.  However, it loses points because the combat itself is clumsy.","Not Perfect, But A Step In The Right Direction"

B00MU1YEE0,3.0,"This only covers multiplayer. I read up before I bought this, and nearly all the professional reviews on gaming sites had a consistent theme: ""It's not an evolution for the franchise, but it's freshened up just enough to be worthwhile and exciting again."" I call B.S. The theme was so consistent that the rumors of big developers sending out ""talking points"" to the sites who score advance copies (and want to keep getting them in the future) must be true.

If you loved COD multiplayer in the past, and aren't yet sick of it, then you will love this game. If you were growing weary of the repetition before, this year's COD will not ""breath new life"" into the game as the professional reviewers would want you to believe. You can try a different topping on your pizza every night of the week, but come Friday night, you have still had pizza every night for dinner. Every yearly installment of COD has turned into pizza with just a different topping. The perks are largely the same. The weapons are largely the same. The only (minor) nuance is the addition of the jet pack/exosuit, because adding a vertical dimension with jet packs is the flavor of this year's gaming year. (see Titanfall and Destiny for examples). This new wrinkle is not enough to make you go ""OMG, this game is so new again!""

Soon, I felt like I was playing the same matches I played last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. Some are saying this is the greatest COD since Black Ops 2. I respectfully disagree. Black Ops 2 had great maps. These maps, to accommodate the jump packs, have been built more vertically, rather than out. It's like turning a one story house into a two story house with the same amount of square feet. It's taller but a bit more cramped. Some of the maps are also really bland and generic looking, and are how I would imagine Mass Effect 3 if it was a multiplayer game.

Do I hate it? No, but I am kicking myself for buying into the hype and BS reviews that claimed this years installment was just fresh enough to ""reinvigorate"" the franchise. To me, they might as well claim new seat covers and some air freshener will make my car feel ""new"" again. If you gotta have and play the yearly COD, then by all means jump on in and have some fun. If you are on the fence, and can still recall when the dread of familiarity first started setting in for you with this franchise, hold off until the inevitable holiday discounts. If you gotta eat pizza every night for dinner, you might as well use some coupons.","Same old, Same old."
B00HKEI4HU,3.0,"Pros:
-The wrist rest is very well made, helps me relax my hands onto the keyboard
-A nice amount of spacing between the keys helps with accuracy
-The lights are not annoyingly bright when I am trying to sleep with the keyboard on, but help you see the keys at night
-The key disabling function is great for disabling the windows key and other keys to keep them from disrupting the game
-Thin and sleek keyboard, but takes up a bit more space than the average keyboard
-not bad for a membrane keyboard when it comes to competitive typing

Cons:
-WORST choice for people with oily hands, the oil is hard to come off or doesn't come off at all
-Because the keys have a bit of space from the key and the frame to allow the lights to show through, it is a particle and dust magnet and sometimes it can get stuck in there. Can be cleaned out with compressed air but not 100% of the time
-No macro keys, I was a little disappointed about this but then again, it was expected

B0047THYWC,3.0,"First of all, I enjoyed playing DA2.  Just thought I should put that out there.  But I could have enjoyed it SO MUCH MORE!
Here are my issues

  *Recycling terrain over and again

  *The limited amount of animations in combat and dialogue.  Watching Hawke make the same gestures and pace around the room got old after the fourth or fifth time, and combat with him making the same repetitive moves swinging his staff about in the same rhythm also got tiresome.

  *The ""dark"" setting.  I didn't consider DAO to be particularly dark.  Looking back I suppose it was.  But the mood in DA2 is simply contrived.  Sure, it's not all black and white, but when you present a reasonable character and then make him go completely nuts (no spoilers, but if you've played, you know who I'm talking about), the issue just seems forced.  It seems towards the end of the game nobody has any sense anymore.

  *Level scaling.  Level scaling is a cancer on CRPGs.  I hate finding some nice item only to see it become obsolete next chapter.

  *Items seemingly randomly generated.  Having to sort through a few dozen belts all with similar benefits that don't really stand out much anyways is annoying.  If I want randomly created loot, I'll play Diablo.

  *The dialogue wheel.  Yay!  My character's personality is now limited to three choices!  Wooo!

  *Wave combat.  It kills strategy.  Where before, I had to set up my dudes and prepare to cast spells like death cloud in certain places or maybe have my aura guy stand right there that's all sort irrelevant if enemies are just going to jump down next to you from the roof.  If that were the case for some combats, I'd be fine with that.  I'd even like it.  But for all of them it's just annoying not knowing how many more you have to kill (like, when is this combat going to end already?) and not knowing where they're coming from (why can't I go on the roofs to find them, anyways?).

  *Bugs.  I bought the game early, and encountered some quest breaking bugs.  I assume those have been patched out.  Still disappointing.

  *Rogues are just fighters, now.  Maybe you could try making sneaking useful?

  *Setting again.  Why do I keep getting attacked by hundreds of bandits in the middle of the city?  Where is the city guard and why are there still bandits after I've killed so many?

  *The equipment for my character was pretty limited, and a lot of it looked pretty silly.  Maybe if I'd spent extra money on DLC...

  *Health.  Injuries in DAO were interesting.  A concussion  would screw your mental stats, a torn muscle your strength.  In DA2, all injuries are health percentage reductions.  Blah.  I don't remember if health healed automatically after battle in DAO, but the fact that it does really removes any fears of survival, and it makes healing spells much less appealing.

  *Classes.  I'd have liked to have been offered a little bit more choice.  I didn't want Hawke to be a blood mage or a spirit healer, you know.

All in all, Dragon Age 2 is actually a good game.  But it's the sequel to Dragon Age: Origins, and that was a fantastic game.  Therefore it is held up to a higher standard.  DA2 doesn't add anything to the series.  Instead, it takes things away.  Naturally, this makes it a worse game.
I don't understand why devs think it's a good idea to remove beloved features from a game's sequel.  If I made video games, my slogan would be ""Add and improve, don't remove!""
I honestly can't think of anything Dragon Age 2 does better than it's predecessor, or anything it has its predecessor didn't.  Even the graphics don't seem much different.  I'd have been happy with another expansion for DAO.
Oh well.  Here's to hoping for Dragon Age III",I miss Origins...

B00005TQ0X,3.0,"I played this DVD game for all but two hours and got tired of it.  It does feel like you are truely on another planet and the visual animation is very realistic, eg. rippling water, ect; but it is very hard to control your movement and the two centeral characters are terrible actors and I hate hearing thier voices. The puzzels are solvable but not brain teasers, just having to write simbols on paper and copy what they say(I hate copying).  Most of the puzzles are not logical, if you work with them enough you can solve them without even thinking!  A cut scene or two at the beginning at least would have been nice instead of that cheezy narration and slide show.  What else is there in adventure games?
Control- irritating,
Puzzles- mindless at times(just take notes),
cut-scenes- non existant,
character interaction- non exsitant except for brief ghostly visits which you can't talk too.
Acting- terrible.
One thing you want in an adventure game is at least ONE of these things to be good.  I have played adventure games in the past and for a while they were good, but it seems lately they are just cheezy put-together's.  I guess because PC games are mainstream and most mainstreamers like action.

B00C9UND8U,3.0,"Having played every game in the Nancy Drew Adventure Game series, I've experienced the truly scary places that HER Interactive can take us (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew-Curse-of-Blackmoor-Manor/dp/B0002ZALES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor</a>) and the frustratingly boring (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew-Ransom-of-the-Seven-Ships/dp/B0026EV5FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships</a>).  Because of the great expectations other games in the series have created, this new offering just falls short of its predecessors.  While the mystery itself has engaging moments, the horror hinted at by the developers just isn't present and the game ends up being more boring than scary.

STORY - Jessalyn Thornton has gone missing just before her wedding is supposed to take place.  You, as Nancy Drew, are called in by famed ghost hunter extraordinaire Savannah Woodham (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew-Shadow-at-the-Water-s-Edge/dp/B0041CASX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge</a>) to investigate the disappearance in relation to supposed ghost sighting by family members. As you look into whether or not foul play is involved, it increasingly becomes apparent that supernatural forces may be the ones trying to keep Jessalyn from her wedding...

To begin with, this story has already existed in the Nancy Drew Adventure Game universe...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nancy-Drew-Haunting-of-Castle-Malloy/dp/B003BHGWMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy</a>&nbsp;anyone?  Same story premise, some of the same plot twists, same ghost elements, etc.  The story just isn't original, it's a huge turn off to anyone who has played the other Nancy Drew games.

Also, the scares are practically nonexistent.  Hardly anything jumps out at you, the atmosphere is dilapidated not creepy, and several of the incidents that are supposed to scare players are instead cheesy and repetitive.  For instance, nearly every time you walk past a certain location, a statue head turns and looks at you.  Not only is the animation cheesy in the first place, but it also happens a lot and just gets downright boring after a bit.

There aren't many plot twists; for a ghost story, everything is fairly straightforward.  Backstory plays a large role in place of twists, and it just adds up to something of a fictitious history lesson for the entire game.

GAMEPLAY - Like all other games in this Nancy Drew series, this game is a first person, point-and-click adventure game.  You have a fairly small house and its grounds to explore for clues as to where Jessalyn is.  There are puzzles for you to solve, such as decoding cell phone passwords, unlocking boxes, and creating pictures with a set amount of shapes.  None of the puzzles are particularly deep or challenging and for the most part, left me wanting to have to think just a little bit more (and I played on the supposed ""hard"" difficulty).

Interacting with suspects is another huge portion of the game.  There are approximately four characters for you to speak with, and you get to choose how you interrogate them and how you respond to what they say.  You also have three people that you can call on your cell phone to discuss the case with.  These people act as your sounding board, offering often humorous suggestions as to how to solve the mystery.  Dialogue wasn't very interesting since it was quite predictable.  For example, if you ask a suspect if they kidnapped Jessalyn, of course they'll deny it.  Most discussions were like this.  A new feature in this game, though, is the ability to skip dialogue.  If you read faster than the suspect talks, or you want to replay the game without listening to the same dialogue, you now have the option to skip it with the click of your mouse.

There was a bit of lag in this game, which is uncharacteristic for the other Nancy Drew games.  I supposed it could possibly be my computer, but I don't think the graphics or memory is drastically different.  Also, I see several other reviewers complain of the same problem, so I'm more inclined to blame the developer for these areas.

The length was a bit disappointing; the game only lasted about six hours.  I would have liked more.

GRAPHICS/SOUND - I found the backgrounds to be beautifully designed in this game.  The house was particularly breathtaking; the characters were not.  Past games have had more realistic characters, and the lip syncing was a bit off in this adventure.  I was disappointed.

Music was also disappointing.  I didn't find any of the tracks to be particularly memorable.

Sound effects were great, however, as was the voice acting; characters sounded very authentic.

OVERALL - On its own, the game is fairly decent.  It's not as scary as it claims, and it could do with a few more challenging puzzles, but it still manages to be fun.  When this game is compared to others in the series, that's when it falls apart and just can't compare.  For veteran fans of the series, don't get high expectations and buy the game only if you can get it on sale.  For new fans, I'd recommend trying a previous title in the series before this one.","Not scary enough, too short, and fairly predictable"
B004M191TY,3.0,"Full disclosure--I've played WoW for 5 years, and greatly enjoyed it. After playing Rift for a month, I haven't. Rift has incorporated many of WoW's best features:leveling allows you to shape the character you play; it has a robust set of skills and spells; and professions to master and gain gold--I mean resources. Rift also increases the excitement of play by having the rift-events, in which you can join with others to overcome an unexpected incursions. You get a mount very early in the game, and the grafics/cinematics are very good.  So what is wrong?

The biggest is the lack of sense of humor.  Encounters with NPC's are like hitting an ATM. In WoW you meet funny and interesting characters, and there are quests that can be silly (goading a monster into spitting vile slime onto you, then collecting it). Rift is for accountants.

The unpredictable rift-events that I looked forward to have a little problem, which is extreme predictability. The first one is a challenge, the second one less so, and from there on you know what is going to happen and when.

If you are going to try this game, do consider the Collector's Edition. It gives you a good-sized bag and a mount, making the early levels much more interesting.

B0050SWYTC,3.0,"It's a very good game, but it was drastically over hyped. Gameplay is decent but it definitely feels like a small handheld game. Levels are often very basic and linear, textures are used again and again, and encounters with AI feel very ""dumb"". The biggest problem with the game for me was the poor AI and level design. I often felt like i was playing one of the PS One Metal gear solid games, which for their time were great games, but I've come to expect a little more ""Intelligence"" in my AI. I'll avoid going off on every little detail in the interest of time but in the end the game isn't the FPS that Vita owners have been dying for, no matter how badly we want it to be. While it does provide a respectable shooter experience for the vita I've come to the conclusion that the Vita itself is simply not capable of providing a true console quality FPS experience.

They fit perfect on my xbox 360 controllers, they are too big for xbox one, and they spin... I did manage to get one to fit nice and snug after wrapping the left joystick with teflon tape several times, THEN putting the short concave pad on over it, and I use a KF FPS grip on the right...I just love my controller now, plus I got a purple FL controller cover that adds nice grip, but sadly, I also had to hack it, and cut a bigger opening at the bottom so I could connect my headset adapter into it, but thankfully the rubber is strong enough, and doesnt run when u cut it... (after I made the cuts I needed, I made a small slit on a scrap piece, and tried pulling it apart... Suprising how much effort it actually took, so I am confident it will last!)

And last con incase you decide to get both... You will have to cut a tiny bit around the joystick hole too, as the thumbstick is too wide and short, that the rubber from the grip of the stick, and the grip on the controller cover will make slight contact.... not a big deal for most games, but ones where u must make quarter circles, or larger it will grip together...

Ok.. First of all, they took my pointers and tried improving this, but the old version was better in some ways, and decided to keep it on and give these away, as for I... I am a purple kind of guy, and kind of my signature color....

I have bought from same seller's old stock, and the purple shown, and the purple i got were similar..... this time the color purple shown in description is the same as old stock description, but the actual color is much lighter, and more pink than anything.

You need to try out peripherals before you buy them to make sure they fit the individual. That being said, I used this mouse for less that 24 hours before I put it back in its box and sent it back to the seller. For me and the way I use a mouse, the right button was far too sensitive and the mouse felt very light. Some people may prefer the weight, but I have always preferred a hefty, chunky mouse. I do not have big hands, but I just like the heavier mice. I noticed that anytime I went to click or double-click something I would inevitably right click. I could not stand it. Additionally, the mouse scroll-wheel is a click-by-click type of scroll wheel. This might be fantastic for games, but I need a mouse that can multitask and I cannot sit there and scroll and scroll and scroll through a website or large spreadsheet when something like a logitech lets you toggle between infinity scroll and click-by-click scroll wheel.

I was disappointed to find that the only real perks to buying the full version is the amount of turns you can play, and the civilizations that you can control. Each civilization has a different leader with slightly different attributes (some start with certain technologies that others don't, or maybe roads will be half price, etc.). Other than the attributes, there is no real difference in the civilizations. There's little variety when choosing different starting civilizations. Also, the game doesn't allow you to play for a long enough time. It cuts you off before you can really create a vast empire. Yeah, if you bust through this game, you can win domination victories up the whazoo, but sometimes, I just want to learn all of the technologies, create a superior bank, have the greatest culture... and then crush my enemies. I don't know. This could just be me, but I wish it was constructed a little bit more like Age of Empires. The turn-based system gets old fast, and the tiny little dink armies get frustrating. I want to be able to build a massive army of archers, or a huge fleet of galleons. We are sadly just limited to three units per army.

B002I0IVC4,3.0,"I was thrilled when I heard about a Street Fighter game being released in 3D. Awesome! Of course, I have none of the most recent consoles, but then I learned it'd be out on the 3DS. That I do have, so I was glad I could still play the game without needing to somehow get an XBox 360. What I learned right away is that Super Street Fighter IV is not the same as Ultra Street FIghter IV. Whoops! So don't expect to find Poison in this version.

Overall, I say the game is average. The graphics are pretty nice, the voice acting isn't so hot, and the controls are hit and miss. Keep reading for more in-depth reviews of each aspect of the game.

GRAPHICS: 9/10
I thought the graphics were great, the attacks were nicely animated, and there are some neat anime cut scenes for each character when you start and finish the game. No complaints here.

CONTROLS: 8/10
No annoying mile-long combos in this game! Rather, four attacks are at your disposal on the lower 3DS screen. Two combos are always available, one becomes available I think after you land a certain number of hits, and the ultra combo becomes an option only after you get the crap kicked out of you enough (in other words, you can't use the ultra combo if you intend to go for a perfect). The other controls are pretty easy and, as always, button mashing will be your best friend to pull off more than just the basic punches and kicks. The reason I'm giving the controls a 8/10 rating is because there is no way to block during fights. There's an auto-block feature, but it's pretty useless. I hate that I can't do anything to prevent my opponent from shoving his/her foot up my arse except jumping across the screen like Daffy Duck (though a silly laugh would make this an acceptable alternative).

AI: 5/10
The computer sucks for one huge reason: your opponents can and will block absolutely everything, including your ultimate combo. You can't block their ultimate combo attacks, though. Isn't that just dandy? And good luck with Seth at the end because he's just complete BS. Word of warning, jump when each round begins because he likes to strike first with Dhalsim's low stretch punch. And he will be considerably harder to defeat after you beat him once. For the heck of it, I fought him with Blanka and just spammed his electric shock attack. Seth would just walk right into it like an idiot and I beat him doing just that. Round two, he got much smarter and would use his little magnet pull-you-closer attack and then his ultimate combo. Seth isn't the reason I'm rating the computer so low because I figured the final boss would be a pain. I just hate that I can't effing block anything unless the computer decides to block for me once in a great while. It's like signing up for auto-pay and your computer just doing whatever the hell it wants regardless of what you want it to do. Meanwhile, the regular computer opponents seem to be hit and miss, depending on the difficulty level you pick.

SOUND/MUSIC: 8/10
To be fair, I don't pay much attention to the music when trying to focus on not getting pulverized, but from what I can tell, it seems very fitting for Street Fighter. The voice acting could be better. This isn't news to folks who have played other Street Fighter games, but many of the characters aren't American. I'd like to have heard more accents among some of the characters for the sake of a little diversity. Would it have been too much to ask for Chun-Li to not sound like a moody American teenager?

It's definitely an interesting experience playing Street Fighter on a hand-held system compared to a regular console. Would I buy this again knowing what I know now? Probably not. I don't know how this compares to the other recent Street Fighter releases, but this one's nothing to write home about.","Ehh, not bad. In retrospect, I wouldn't buy again"
B003UFAZZW,3.0,"I have enjoyed Dragon Age 2, but there are lots of negatives attached to it. For one, the inventory system pretty much sux. All the coolest items are relegated to your main character, and if he isn't the class specified for the item, then it is useless throughout the entire game, except as something to be sold. The storyline isn't nearly as deep or as intense as Dragon Age Origins. On the plus side, the graphics are pretty sweet and the combat system has more flow to it. It is fun, but not so much so that it can hold my attention for more than a few hours. Quite unlike DAO, where i spent a few days holed up in my apartment playing through it twice.

Like i say, it is fun, and you won't regret owning it, but it won't be the prize of your collection either, and you will set it down in favor of other games repeatedly.","Fun, but not nearly as much so as the first title"
B002BRYXRQ,3.0,"I have been waiting for L4D2 For so long just to get disappointed. I want previous characters. They were so much fun. This new characters are boring. I don't want to play it because after first L4D it seems so different. I wish next L4D be better with story line and characters of course. Stop killing them on other consoles. We want to be able to play them. Be it a campaign or a death matches. And now the good part: loads of weapons, and new zombies. But yet this game lacks something that L4D gave me, the sweet atmosphere, the desire to never stop the game and play and re-play the level. So I finished going through all levels, and unlike Left 4Dead 1, I'm not playing Left 4 Dead 2 again. I don't want to.",Not better than first L4D

B000RPHJDO,3.0,"Eastern European gaming companies have came up with some great ideas in the last 5 years (STALKER and THE WITCHER pop to mind, to name just a couple). Unfortunately, although it tries hard, YOU ARE EMPTY is NOT one of the best examples.

This game's strengths are mainly the story and the settings. Soviet-era mentality had always been obsessed with mind-control sciences, and when something goes terribly wrong the world is turned into a zombie and cyber-entities cesspool.
The graphics are nice (comparable, at least, to those of HL2 - a 6-year old game mind you), the surfaces are not too shabby (notice that they have been done painstakingly in polygons, not bump mapping!) - and the game engine, although previously untested, hardly ever glitches! Now THAT is solid kung-fu programming!
The scenery, with all the Soviet propaganda posters and the beautifully done cut-scenes, is gorgeous; whereas, the sounds and music have been tastefully chosen, with radio loop-announcements cutting through the cold Russian wind making the power-lines whistle: this is a game that is really easy to get immersed into!
Interestingly, YOU ARE EMPTY runs for well over 16 hours(!): this is how long FPS games used to last - and not the miserly 3-4 hours the latest over-hyped releases do...

On the down side, the weapons may be realistic yet could not be more generic and unimaginative; movement is slower than flowing syrup, something especially nerve-raking when enemies have the tendency to jump you from all directions; and the damage (both sustained and inflicted) is hardly balanced: it is preferable to get hit by a grenade than to jump a single floor, to absorb several bullets that get bitten by a single rat and to keep using your sidearm than a rifle, since they do about the same damage, appear to have the same range and the sidearm can hold more bullets...!

This is a game that had been available since 2008 in Europe before finding distribution in the US - and, undoubtedly, this is not helping its chances to impress. We should count our blessings though: the European release also featured the infamous...StarFORCE.

This is a solid first effort by DIGITAL SPRAY, a newly founded group, that although fails to stand out in this pre-Christmas crowd, lays stable groundwork for its future developments. Let's only hope they do not get outright absorbed into a gaming mega-corporation...

All in all: a creative and atmospheric game that is worth a budget admission price.",AN ATMOSPHERIC GAME IN NEED OF BALANCING
B00ZM5OXD8,3.0,"I absolutely loved Dishonored and hoped that this sequel would build on and add to that beginning. But although this is a good game, it lives in the shadow of Dishonored.

First though, if you do buy this, here is something I wish was clearer. Do not play each mission purely goal oriented. If you rush through to the goal, you'll be missing what was intended as the most rewarding game play. You should explore each mission area entirely. You'll find things of use to you well beyond that particular level, as well as interesting asides.

As to the game itself, here's the good and the not so good.

Good: Incredible graphics. Nice balance of hard and easy in how you do things. Some interesting gameplay.

Bad: Overall lack of variation. The levels seem repetitive and not nearly as dynamic and different from one another as the first game (remember the brothel? And the brewery?). And, although on the face of things, it looks like you have as many options about how you play as in the first game, there is a problem with the stealth feature. First, adversaries seem able to see you around corners, a mile away, on top of a building, and generally ... anywhere. Even if you're sneaking, sound can give you away. And the movement and clusters of adversaries gives you little chance for one-and-done stealth attacks as the first game did. You simply can't weed them out like you could in the first game.

All that said, this sequel is hardly a terrible game. It's fun, if sometimes a little boring (hey Bethesda, dial back on the forever cut scenes!).","Good, but not as Good as the Original"

I immediately regret that decision.
While there's traces of it here, it's very vague.
The thing I like the most about this game is that you have to work as a team if you play as the humans.
The monster aspect seems very slow, but that may just be because it's something I'm not used to.
The dlc they rolled out in pre orders seems confusing.
From what I hear the season pass is mainly made up of color changes to character skins and nothing more.
I would gladly pay it if it meant new characters and weapons or maps but not for color changes.
The maps work well but to be honest, half the times I couldn't tell the difference between them.
There are only a few characters unlocked at the beginning so don't be mislead if you've read you can choose from 12.
You have to unlock them by leveling your character up.
Graphically the game doesn't impress, gameplay wise it's a new take on fps.
Story wise...there's very little.
If you're on the fence about whether or not you should buy this, wait til it's $20 or rent it first.

It was the same franchise that many have come to know and love, but of course it's very short, and because of that, you don't have much opportunity to explore many different outcomes, or get to know the characters.  This is to be expected, since it's only an hour or two of play time, and that's going pretty slowly through it.  If you've played Season 1, and you can get this on sale, I'd recommend it, but for me (being a total cheapskate) I wouldn't have paid 5 bux, though I was glad to get it for what I believe was $1.25 on sale.",It's fine

Unfortunately it reminds me of the days of genesis control functions where going up a hill made your character look strange on the screen but, it's evil dead! If you're a fan, you'd love it.  I have to give the game one thumb up.... not bad for a begining.

B0041RR0TW,3.0,"I am a bit conflicted with this controller...

At the price, it is a decent controller. It is fairly solid and works quite well, but there are some cons:

-Batteries die quite quickly (sometimes I'm not sure if the controller is off)
-There is a decent amount of interference (I often see my character rotate around for a few seconds)
-The sticks feel too large and loose for a FPS
-The triggers are awkward and smooshy

I would personally recommend using an official Xbox One or even Xbox 360 controller. For ~$25 you can buy an adapter that would work with a windows PC and allow you to use any Xbox One controller. This contoller just does not feel up-to-par with the competition.","Okay if you are on a budget, but not great."
B0009R1SRS,3.0,"When I seen that Madden is going to have competition this year, I was more than excited to see someone testing EA and their purchase of the market.  But, after playing nearly the whole campaign and against several users, this game is OKAY at best.  It really seems like this game was rushed to meet deadline.  There are so many bugs that hurt this games rather than positives that enhanced it.

The first thing I noticed when playing the game was the kickoff.  When you return the kick, the opposing team follows the carrier, and I mean follow.  When you go right, EVERYONE goes right.  The team pretty much emulates your moves w/ the controller.  This reminds me of the 'ol Ten Yard Fight controls on old regular Nintendo, didn't work for them, don't know how it would work for this.

This game just really doesn't feel like a football game.  It is so arcade its almost uncomfortable.  NFL Street is more real football than this.  And that game was over the top to the extreme.  I wanted so much to love this game but there are so many things to dislike it was hard.  But, needless to say, I love the injuries.  Breaking someones leg or arm never gets old.  But, it does amaze me that they will only sit out 2 to 3 quarters even if you do not chose to drug them up and send them back into the game.

This game overall is a renter for hardcore gamers and Madden players.  I found this game just too easy.  I have played Madden since Madden '95 on Sega so I know football games pretty well.  I conquered this game w/in the first 10 minutes of playing.  I knew what plays worked everytime by halftime.  The defense unfortunately does not have knowledge of defensive plays.  So, they forget to cover and are lost when you get behind the safeties and juke back and forth, like the days of Super Techmo Bowl.

I tried so much to like this game.  Just way to bad to LOVE.  I did like the idea of the game and the attempt Midway made on creating SOME form of competition.  I could see this game being great a few years down the road.  But, for now its just a starting point, and you can see a promising future, just not this year.

Just buy NFL street 2 and wait for this game next year. It will cost you 30 bucks less too.....",Nice effort.....

The game must load EVERYTIME you start a road rage board, mission, or sunday drive.  The missions are only 50 or so seconds long (no extra time) and the loading time is nearly the same length!  If you restart a level it has to load again.  It should ""remember"" the board and be able to start over again in seconds like the Xbox does in games like Halo and Amped.
The game itself is short, and can be beaten pretty easily.  You could probably rent it from Blockbuster, end up spending 15 - 20 dollars on late fees and be done with it.
If you have a friend with an Xbox, split the cost with him and buy this game.  Besides for the above problems, IT IS A REALLY FUN GAME.  I love the Simpsons.  This game is a MUST PLAY, and whether or not it's a MUST BUY is up to you.",Game Flaws!!  Wasn't this QA'ed? Loads too much and too long
B00DBM1RVA,3.0,"In a short summary it's an ok game worth buying but it's not a fabulous game that would be memorable..
The initial few hours are very exciting when you explore the world, get into the initial fights, etc..
After the first 10-15 hrs you start to notice you're doing pretty much the same stuff (conquering camps through fighting and blowing up things, clearing scavenging locations, destroying scarecrows and sniper posts) all the time.. After 20+ hrs it's getting tedious.
The missions/quests are fairly repetitive and straight forward as well.. you go to place fight some dudes, find artifact/car/something and that's it..
The game is also pretty short if you would decide to follow just the main story..
The fights are interesting initially but as everything else get very repetitive after short time.. you counter and hit, counter and hit, counter and so on and on until everyone is dead.. The only challenging part for me was the race against Stank Gum and I had to reload that part more than few times before I succeeded.. but that would be the only thing..
Worth mentioning are also glitches and bugs that usually involve music and sounds but also sometimes quests.. They usually resolve atfer restarting the game but still are annoying.
In overall I did enjoy it for few initial hours but after 20+ hours I just wanted it to end.. I finished the main story and cleared most of the lands but I'm not motivated to go back and get 100% of everything..","Good, but gets repetitive.. and then it gets tedious.."

Pagan Min is very interesting, and riding in on elephants with a machine gun is cool. But wait, Pagan Min isn't in the game for more then 30 minutes, and you get used to everything else really quickly. The combat and missions are almost all exactly the same.

The 'hallucination' sequences are pretty dumb as well. Like I said, this game blew me away for the first 5 hours, and then I just wanted to finish it.

B000X99VYE,3.0,"I've been a fan of almost all of the Tom Clancy games, and expected to like this one as well as I also really like RTS games. Sadly, ENDWAR just didn't live up to my expectations. The gameplay is simplistic and doesn't require any use of tactics or strategy. I found the game to be very easy, but fraught with frustrations like the irritating limiting of the camera. You cannot scroll around freely like in VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER RTS GAMES. Your perspective is limited to that of your units, with a sort of modified 3rd person view like in a FPS.

Another issue is that the game lacks intensity. Blowing things up is entertaining, but it only goes so far. There are no situations created by either brilliant AI or odds stacked against you that get your pulse up. Nothing to compare even to much older games like STARCRAFT (especially the map on Char when you have to defend a base from a massive ZERG invasion for the first time). It feels like a super simplified eye candy fest that will not likely appeal to hard core RTS fans.

There are some great things about the game. The story is interesting and believable (to a point--it is a video game). The idea of the US and Europe locked in a war, a post apocalyptic Middle East, and a resurgence of Russian military power all are frighteningly believable in today's geopolitical situation. The storyline is also interesting, and the acting very well done. However, this isn't enough to save a game with relatively boring gameplay; you'll find yourself either frustrated with the story because it is better than the game, or wishing that UBI had made a movie rather than an RTS.

Worth noting is that this game was released DRM free, for which UBI Soft should be commended. They also released Prince of Persia (which is a much better game on the whole) DRM free, and here is hoping they continue that trend. I also hope they get back to making interesting, playable games instead of this weak effort.

2.5/5 Stars. Only worth buying if you value storyline over gameplay, or just want to see things blow up with a minimum of effort. If you are a hard core RTS player, skip this one.","Simplistic combat, annoying camera anlge, but it's fun to blow things up"
B00005B8IX,3.0,"The Good: Great sense of speed, nostalgic feeling from SNES days, challenging

The Bad: Gets old quick, only four vehicles, feels more like an expansion to the original rather than a new game, difficulty can be overwhelming

F-Zero is a much loved series, but it doesnt get much love from Nintendo. With the Gamecube having the last F-Zero game, fans are wondering if the series is completely dead and shelved by the big N. Thankfully, fans who loved the SNES classic can have even more with Maximum Velocity.

Maximum Velocity is pretty much built on the same engine as the SNES using Mode 7 graphics. However, this may not have been the best choice to go as there are other more advanced racing games on the system. There are only four cars to select and I found the controls to be incredibly slippery and the AI to be extremely difficult to beat. The tracks are fun to drive, but the sense of speed is great, but the game is just lacking in overall content and polish.

You could write all that off on the age of the engine, the GBAs inferior hardware, or lazy design. Maximum Velocity feels more like an expansion pack to the original game more than one that can stand on its own two feet. After you have memorized all the hazards and turns in each track it does get easier, but not by much. This game is for players who want a serious challenge with the retro feel.

While the GBA isn't exactly ideal for racing games, this one really stands out as one of the best, people going back in time may find it nearly impossible to play due to its ancient gameplay ideals and design. However, you are missing a great opportunity to spend a fun afternoon racing on your GBA.",Not the F-Zero return we wanted
B00TY9KYKE,3.0,"I bought this in the last week from another retailer promotion. The deal was just to good to skip.

Anyways I have been avoiding this console for some time and to be honest...at the current price it simply isn't worth the cash. Don't get me wrong I am seriously enjoying my time with Forza but in the last week I bought as many games for my Vita as I plan for the X1 in the next year.

Okay now I am going to go onto other things.

First, this thing is SLOW. The only thing slower is my 3ds and Wii U. It isn't even on the same level with my PS4. That thing is turned on and in netflix in seconds where this is like a min. The UI is terribly cluttered and busy. While I never really cared for PS4s simplistic approach I now understand why it is there. It is lightning fast. The PS4 actually feels an entire generation ahead in this area.

Second, Microsoft for some reason believes people like crazy vivid colors and crushed blacks. Issue with this is that it seems to apply to the entire console. Games have crushed blacks, media...if you don't know what that is then allow me to explain. After a certain level of darkness the X1 just turns the pixel to absolute black. So in the event you are looking at a dark jacket you won't be able to see the fine details. In Forza Horizon 2 it makes night driving quite awful. I had to jack up the brightness to offset it but THAT ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO FIX THIS.

Games..this is where it gets hairy. I personally think we should try and own all the consoles. I am not getting Forza Horizon 2 on my PS4 and I am not getting Star Ocean or Uncharted on my X1. They each have amazing game libraries to pull from. I really think this point needs to be drove home. This is why I can overlook some of the issues. In the end the games make the system.

Anyways my suggestion to a new buyer with no consoles would be to get the PS4 first and get this second. This is a good console but I would NEVER purchase it as my main machine. It is just to slow and clunky. It is hard to believe this is going on 3 years old and still has errors all over the place. Games though :p

B001UW9ZW6,3.0,"Basic: If you liked Marvel Ultimate Alliance, you'll like this sequel even more.

Graphically: Similar to first, but improved. The environments look a lot better and the character interactions aren't too bad. It's a RPG so you're stuck with a certain viewpoint at times, but you do control how close/far you are from your four characters for the most part.

Bugs: They're working on some problems. One was joining an online game and the hangups. There are some glitches on some of the missions, but I've found if you exit and reload the game save, it'll fix itself. One in particular was a boss battle and you have to eliminate the surrounding enemies before you can damage the boss (rinse, repeat), but one of my characters knocked one of the guards off the edge, preventing me from causing any harm to him.

Gameplay: The added fusions are lots of fun and the character abilities are close to what I would expect them to be able to do. The different fusions in the game are definitely where it is at, tons of different interactions between the list of characters. There are some similarities when using like characters, but for the most part there are three basic fusions (guided, targeted, clearing) and depending upon which heroes you have and who you're trying to initiate the Fusion with, you might be limited to what fusions you can do.
The missions aren't too bad, and I think the best part of the game is choosing sides and having different bosses through a section of the game. I'd recommend playing through twice, once on regular/hard difficulty through either Pro or Anti-Reg, and another time through the other on Legendary difficulty.

Sounds/Voices: for the most part the voice-acting was really well done. Most of the characters sound like they should. And a lot of the familiar marvel sounds are there.

Online/MP: as mentioned, the online can be problematic, but it is more fun to play through the scenarios with a co-op buddy (on or offline). Especially since the AI doesn't do the best of jobs of managing your non-human controlled allies.

Recommend?: Yes and No. Great for Marvel fans and RPGers. If you liked MUA, XMen Legends, etc., you'll like MUA2. The DLC is kind of pricey however (it's cool that they added Carnage, Psylocke, Magneto, and Cable tho!). The Juggernaut is fun to use, but is only available separately. If you have a friend that has the game and the character, just join their game to try out the Juggernaut (there are free patches to allow for Co-op members to share DLC while online, but once you quit, you'll be back to your standard team list). The game takes some time to get through considering it has a bunch of simulator challenges, hidden conversations, hidden collectibles, and 2 different playthroughs, but after that you're done.",If you liked MUA...
B00W8FYFBA,3.0,"Cheaters are now exploiting the game and with limited content at the moment EA/Dice better put a cap on it otherwise they will lose a lot of players. Played a round of walker assault last night where a cheating player (""LEEBSKLEEBS"") was some how able to take endless damage from myself as well as my buddy and not be killed. My buddy was Darth Vader, he hit this person 5 times with the saber and the player took no damage. That player then went on a 28 kill streak until the match was over and he was just a grunt, not a hero of any sorts and he was not equipped with a shield.

Not sure what the cheat was or how it happened but with very limited game modes this would have the potential to ruin it for a lot of people.

Other than that the game is lots of fun even though the choices and weapons are very limited. Hopefully the freebies are coming because I won't be dropping another 50 on DLC unless the base game is spruced up by about 200% on all accounts.",... game and with limited content at the moment EA/Dice better put a cap on it otherwise they will lose ...
B000006OVE,3.0,"Breath Of Fire 3 is a traditional RPG with a combination of 3D and 2D graphics.  The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.","Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game"
B00024W1TC,3.0,"I recently purchased this game, because I grew up watching the 'zilla films on Saturday late morning ""monster theater"". The rubbery suited creatures had become a part of my imagination for some time, so to acutally be able to play one was indeed a thrill. I also own the game ""War of the Monsters"", which was purchased for the same ""nostalgic"" reasons. I will have to say that when you compare the two games ""War of the Monsters"" wins hands down. The interaction with the environment with WotM is definitely better than in GStE. Although the monster in WotM don't have names that are familiar to people the ""stereotypes"" will be (from giant ""bugs"" that echo movies like ""Them"" to giant apes and lizards similar to Kong and 'zilla to Japanese robots and Army made automons).

The definite ""fun"" aspect to GStE is the fact that you get to play as the old familiar monsters. Even Jet Jaguar becomes an unlockable playable character. The graphics are great, yet the interaction with the environment leaves a lot to be desired, in comparison to WotM. You can pick up ""chunks"" of buildings and throw them at your opponent, which is similar to WotM, but you cannot chuck ""gas trucks"" or impale your opponent with a ""radio tower"" like in WotM.

The buildings in GStE just sort of fall to the ground and even the animation of the monsters walking in the water leaves a lot to be desired.

After saying all that if you are a Godzilla fan then you will most likely enjoy this game (like I do, but on a different level than with WotM). Similar to my review concerning the X-Files game I believe you will like this game more so if you are a fan of the genre than if you are looking to get a good monster smashing game.","Godzilla - Fun for Fans of the ""'zilla"" genre"

Well like I said this game had potential to be great, the plot was awesome and there weren't any loop holes. The battle system was great and the charaters were pretty good.

B00BGA9Y3W,3.0,"I have not seen everything Destiny has to offer. I know this, for a fact. And in fact, I may go one step further and say that I will, in all likelihood, never see everything this game has to offer. Of course, part of this has to do with the absolute chore it is to get this game to get connected, stay connected, and not throw about a dozen different cryptic error messages at me. But I'll save that complaint for later. Because if Bungie's overhyped exercise in the power of marketing was worth putting up with the horrible connection issues and egregious crashes was truly a great, original game, it would be worth it. But it's not. Like many dedicated video game players expected, Destiny is not particularly an original, innovative, or even a fantastic game. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is one of the most derivative, by-the-numbers experiences I've had with a piece of software this year, held together by a half-baked story and truly awful progression.

The story, what little of it is there, is a hodgepodge of cliches filled with utterly forgettable characters and needlessly convoluted terminology. What can be sussed from it is that a giant orb, known as the Traveler (it's a Bungie game, so get ready for about a zillion capitalized nouns,) appeared out of nowhere and beckoned in an era of space travel for humanity. But the Traveler itself has had enemies in its, erm, travels, and those enemies of course end up attacking humanity and ravaging Earth. What remains of humanity is on distant planets, fighting against said enemies, most of whom are comprised by the generically-named Covenent wannabes, the Darkness.

All of this exposition, and so little to care about. Honestly, you can ignore most of this story and be fine. In fact, you might be better off, because it's some of the most uninspired tripe out there, and I honestly expect more from Bungie at this point. This is a studio that's been around since the 90's, giving us the Marathon and Halo games, both series that have interesting lore and compelling narratives. But here? It's the stereotypical ""humanity must survive"" narrative we've seen time and time again in games, and considering this is 2014, where games have evolved to tell fantastic narratives grounded in believable yet fantastical worlds, stuff like this holds the industry back. Simply put, the narrative content of this game is bland and intellectually offensive, and not even worth trying to put thought towards. Because it feels, frankly, like no thought was put into it to begin with.

No real thought seems to have been applied to the rest of the game, either, from what I was able to play. Yes, the core gameplay is very tight, and satisfying to a degree. The gunplay is polished and snappy, the melee feels good, vehicles control like they ought to, but... something is missing. There's a certain kind of spunk the Bungie-developed Halo games had to them, a type of freshness that's almost impossible to describe unless you're actually playing it. Yet that's entirely missing here, much to my chagrin. We have a futuristic story with strange weapons, mysterious worlds, a foreboding intergalactic threat, and yet all one can muster while playing this game is a resounding ""eh."" There is nothing broken here, yet nothing particularly wonderful. It works, but it doesn't excel at its task. When you think of a typical, big-budget, stereotypical ""AAA"" shooter, well, this is it. Right here. Just with some Borderlands elements slapped onto it haphazardly.

And yes, I did say haphazardly. I'm not a big proponent of Gearbox, but with the first two Borderlands, they really nailed something special. They took the addictive qualities found in dungeon-crawling lootfests and somehow translated them successfully into an open-world shooter. There were hundreds of guns, a lively world to explore, and upgrades that packed a real punch if you knew what you were doing. Bungie, knowing that they couldn't just crank out another shooter and call it a day, looked at everything that series did right and figured they could produce a carbon copy. The problem? Borderlands takes place in a living, breathing world inhabited with memorable characters and a constant stream of new and unique weapons. Destiny, on the other hand, exists in a lifeless, dull vacuum, sprinkled with a few characters whose names you'll quickly forget, along with a few guns that wholly unremarkable. Yes, there are upgrades and perks, but why bother? Their progression is incredibly limited and stunted, and can be cheesed by exploiting the patently broken leveling system. Every similarity to that other, better game is only surface-level. It is a sociopathic imitation of an established formula, going through the same routines yet failing to truly grasp what makes it work.

But what really undoes Bungie's allegedly ambitious new game is the insistence of having the entire experience be online. For the uninformed (I don't blame you, Activision has done an awful job advertising this fact,) everything component of Destiny requires the player be constantly connected to the game's servers. Want to progress the stale story? Grind a few levels? Go solo for some loot-hunting? Too bad. Even if you have no interest in playing with anybody else, the game insists that players be connected to the thing like an MMO. The problem I have with this is that the game functions nothing like an MMO. There are a few players in your lobby, and every once in a while, you'll see them do something. Maybe kill an enemy or open a chest. For the most part, though, you'll be wandering the lifeless landscapes by yourself, with no need for any other players. Yeah, you can invite whatever player you run into to form a team, but that's about it. This is a game that could have easily been a single-player experience, and forcing an always-online system onto players just wanting to experience the world by themselves is a pretty scummy thing to do.

Aside from the vast expanse of nothingness to explore and the limp noodle of a campaign to go through, there are some other multiplayer options. There are deathmatches, which are pretty typical affairs albeit with some neat little gadgets, and Bungie promises a future of scheduled community events, such as raids. Again, everything here works as it should, I feel, but it all ultimately comes together in something that feels very undercooked. Bungie has done multiplayer before, and honestly, they've done it in some of the best ways I've ever seen accomplished. But that was with Halo, not this. This just feels a bit forced by comparison, at least for my purposes. For my money, there are better games on the market with playable deathmatch modes, and quite frankly, better games on the PS4 if you're looking for an MMO to sink some hours into.

There are very few other things I can say about Destiny without really forcing myself to try. It's pretty to look at, sure, but as I've been saying this entire write-up, there's nothing particularly engaging the aesthetic on display. There were games about space travel released several years ago with worlds that felt more like living and breathing spaces than boring plains with some stuff to jump on. Even with very polished graphics that look almost lifelike in some areas, nothing can disguise the fact that Bungie has given players a tray of plastic fruit. That is to say, it's all very pretty looking, but there's nothing to really sink your teeth into and pull you into the experience.

Writing about Destiny, I can't help but get a strange sense of deja vu. They are two entirely different games, yes, but this game reminds me very much of this year's Watch Dogs. Both experiences were built up with colossal amounts of hype, using buzzwords like ""revolutionary"" and ""innovative"" to drive preorders up. But at the end of the day, neither product was anything close to what I'd call a game-changer. They're riffs on things we've seen before, and quite honestly, seen done far better. Just because we're in a new generation of consoles doesn't mean developers get permission to just hit the ""reset"" button and start again from the ground up. That's not how this works. Each console generation does not exist in a vacuum, and nobody should get a free pass to just shove something we've been playing for years in our faces and call it the next big thing.

But I guess this is where my opinion of the two games differs. Watch Dogs at least tried. It was a GTA clone, yes, but it had some novel hooks and a nice world, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft has never tried their hands at an open-world crime game. But Bungie doesn't get that much lenience from me. They've been in the industry for a long time, and have been developing shooters for most of that time. They know what they're doing. And for them to put out something this poorly thought-out, this soulless? Well, it's kind of insulting. It's insulting that I ever thought that they were capable of something great beyond Halo.

Ultimately, Destiny is not a bad game. But it's certainly not a good one. It's above-average, yes, and better than the last attempts at shooters Activision has published. That being said, it's still a wholly derivative start to a series that, from first impressions, is looking to be absolutely nothing special. And from the people who crafted some of my favorite console gaming experiences to date, that's a real shame.

Pros:
- Polished gameplay
- Pretty graphics
- Good soundtrack

Cons:
- Awful plot
- Progression is uninspired, dull
- Always-online is unnecessary
- Bungie can do better

B000ZK9QFK,3.0,"What a waste of a legendary character, the game is mediocre at best. It has its moments but every level is pretty much the same. This is probably the dumbest ending to a story line since the Sopranos. If you must buy this is defiantly a $10.00 game.",Where Legends die
B006C27JXG,3.0,"This double set of KontrolFreeks are a good deal; it's a pair of CQCs and Recons, so you can try out either size, or mix and match to suit your playstyle. I have preferred using the shorter ones, personally.

A downside, in my opinion, of the construction of these devices is problematic. It's fairly cheap build quality (the plastic factory seams were still attached to mine), and the clips that slide over and around your analog sticks are stiff enough to shear the rubber coating that covers the top of the thumbsticks, permanently damaging them. This also leaves them without much to grip to, so if they pop off, they don't snap on as tightly after. This is with the original XBox 360 white controllers.

All in all, I'd say this is a good idea, with mediocre execution. Worth having if you're a FPS gamer, and cheap, but don't expect perfection.",Worth having; rough on sticks
B00KDJJL8A,3.0,"I got the game for PS3, but I think it will be more visible here to inform people of what they are getting.  Graphics and sound might be slightly better on PS4 and Xbox one, but the game will be the same.

This game gets 3 stars, mainly because of it's replay value. Let me break down what I mean:

Does not feature a game+ system, so you literally start over fresh every time you complete the game and want to start another play through after completion. This game is good for 6 play throughs, and that's if someone is adamant about playing all 3 of the available classes as masters of each individual class with good alignment and evil alignment. Unless a person doesn't mind grinding out the levels to master all 3 classes which gets boring after a while, then it'd be good for 2 times through. Fights are wash rinse and repeat, especially towards the end in Blackfrost's Domain. Trash mobs are ridiculously long fights there, as they are excessively resilient and borderline boring to fight, think the scale of some of the trash mobs in Dark Souls 2.

This game is progressive, not open world exploration. You complete a ""Chapter"" you are ushered to a new zone, so make sure you complete all the side quests BEFORE you progress the main story line because there is no going back and finishing anything for the xp bump. The zones are fairly large, and can give you a sense that you are going some where as you trek around, but it's more along the lines of how Last of Us is with chapters and zones.

The companions you can have tag along with you are extremely squishy, and the casters are particularly ignorant even after you change their combat tendencies and set their combat roles. The healer isn't as useful as one would originally believe, the mages are useful with their cc ability neither has any sense to move away from their attackers, so they usually go down pretty quickly. They also do not do a very good job of keeping up with you when you sprint area to area. I fought several mobs all by my lonesome, having absolutely no idea where my companion was. Also, there are irritating parts of certain chapters that you have absolutely no input on who your companion is, and the companion you are stuck with may only be good to keep some of the mobs off of you until the companion is killed while you set your traps and work on the archers.

Ok, those were the cons, now for the positives:

Combat works smoothly. Few hiccups here and there, but nothing major. Works a lot like Dark Souls 2, without the 2h wielding of a weapon for boosted damage, and you don't have to worry about stamina.

Weapon/Armor customizing is nice, however, you will develop your favorites based on effects more than aesthetics. To be effective you MAY not look exactly like you want to look.

The atmosphere is pretty cool, and the music, though mostly one song on repeat the whole game minus the boss fights, is pretty good. It just meshes with the atmosphere in my opinion, probably why they picked it...

Though the fights are repetitive and sometimes extremely frustrating, each fight gives a sense of accomplishment, because anything has the potential to kill you at any given time if you are not paying attention. This is especially true with boss fights.

Crafting consumables is convenient, and very necessary to make life easier. Very easy to get the hang of.

Well, that sums it up I think. 3 stars, but primarily because of the lack of a game+ system. Myself, I do not want to start over, level 1 with crap gear every time I complete the game. The story line is WAY too short not to have a game+ system. All that work that goes into a play through is wiped away when you kill the final boss, and for me, it killed any desire to do it all over again knowing that everything I had achieved, gained and found was null and void and I'd have to play the same content over as if I just opened the box.

B00029QR7O,3.0,"In late 2002, I took a second job at a major electronics retailer and decided to use my employee discount on what looked like a cool game: Civilization III.  That game changed my life... in the gaming sense.  It was everything I ever thought a computer game should be: turn-based strategy with multiple avenues to test my ego and self-promoted genius.  Above all features of Civ3, however, my most favorite was the customization of the game through the map editor and the wonderful online resources of the Civ community.  (I've downloaded more Civ3 files than MP3s.)  This allowed me to express my self-proclaimed genius with new rules, technologies, and units (and all the accompanying chronologies and requisites) at my discretion.  Nothing could get any better, I had thought.

When Civ4 was being talked about, however, I couldn't imagine on what grounds they could improve - except perhaps making the game even more customizable and thorough.  Well, you've already read about the differing features of the game: less micro-management, more diplomatic and trade features, new technology trees, enhancing popular mechanics found in previous Civ titles, and of course, going 3D with it all.

When playing Civilization IV, you sense an overwhelming POTENTIAL to be a really great game.  In my mind, that potential has not been fulfilled, and I hereby advise you to purchase Civ3 Complete instead and forego Civ4 if you haven't chosen so already.  If you have already purchased Civ4, let's send a message to Firaxis Games that they need to do better - let's stop purchasing Civ products until they are actually without so many bugs, that aren't rushed to be released for the holidays, and that don't insult our intelligence by requiring expensive ""expansion packs"" which merely add content that should already have been included in the original release.

Here is a list of comparative reasons to only own Civ3 and not Civ4 and boycott future Civ titles until something changes for the better:

1.  There is no map editor in Civ4.  Instead, they included a ""World Builder"" which is so awkward and strange.  It is not like Civ3's map editor where you can set starting positions, resources, civilizations, and terrain BEFORE you play the map.  The ""World Builder"" of Civ4 only allows you to alter scenarios from the installation or randomly generated maps.  You cannot create maps from scratch - you can only change what has already been created within predefined parameters.

2.  Who needs 3D graphics for a turn-based strategy game?  Civ4 is not fully 3D; it merely allows a tilting view from ground level to overhead.  That can be cool, but consider the offset: it is unnecessary for this genre, it diverts computer resources from other cool and more thorough features, and it makes the game extremely difficult to modify.  For Civ3, there are well over 1,000 things you can either download or make yourself and put right into the game.  You don't have to know XML or Python programming languages as you would in Civ4.  Civ4 requires advanced education (like a graphics design or computer science degree) to simply alter things like governments, units, buildings, and game rules.  Waiting for others to design them (like the amateur online community or the professional expansion packs) isn't so fun anymore.

3.  Expanding content for more money?  This was a problem with Civ3, as well - its first expansion pack was a total waste of money because everything was later put on the second expansion pack.  People bought the first expansion pack because they loved Civ3 so much and didn't know it was a waste.  (Many video game makers are taking advantage of gamers in this way, not just the Civilization makers.)  My point here is to fight back.  We already know what they are going to pull: Civ4 has an expansion pack out there titled Warlords.  It basically includes elements intentionally left out so as to somehow formulate a ""new"" product.  In the base version of Civ4, you have the Great People: artists, scientists, merchants, and prophets.  Hmmm... now we get the warlords, eh?  Oh, and a few other civilizations and buildings left out from before.  Nice try...  Boycott this type of marketing out of sheer principle.  Play Civ3 Complete until Civ5 comes out if you have to.  Maybe Civ will be less of a cheap shot then.

4.  The last reason why you should be content with Civilization III and completely forget that Civilization IV was ever made is the most simple.  Purchasing Civ3 Complete right now (1) will cost you less than half of Civ4; (2) is fully expanded while Civ4 is still looking to make more money off of us; and (3) Civ3 has the very same level of addictive game play as any other Civilization title.  If you have already dropped the cash for Civ4, simply do not support Civ4 any longer.  In fact, uninstall it and put it in your drawer as a sad chapter of shameless marketing.  Yes, Civ4 is fun, but it is does not live up to its potential in most ways.  Playing Civ3 will take up your time quite nicely until they release a REAL title that doesn't take advantage of us so blatantly.

To conclude, my overall point to stick with Civ3 and forego Civ4 is this: without an easy, efficient, and overwhelmingly powerful customizing interface (like an awesome map editor that allows FULL customization), we are simply asking for ""re-tread"" products.  The fact that Firaxis did not include a kick-butt map editor proves in my mind that they expect us to wait for their ""expansions"" to come out and spend at least $150 each before they move onto Civ5.  Hold out with Civ3 Complete and wait until Civ4 goes away.",You Don't Need Civ4

B00009TW6R,3.0,"Life has gotten a lot tougher for video game makers.  Ever since Doom and Grand Theft Auto 3, all serious video games have shifted to lush 3-D environments.  Halo is no exception.  What sets Halo apart is it's innovative story line which makes a game like this much more engaging and rewarding to play.  If there is a solid plot line behind the action, the game succeeds (look at again, The Grand Theft Auto series, and Manhunt, though the plot was dimented, once you got to the end of the story, the plot made great sense), if there is a weak or little plot line and just action, the game fails to generate excitement (see 'State of Emergency') regardless of how great the graphics and action are, if the plot stinks, the player loses interest rapidly.

Halo, has a great story line, which makes it's graphics and gameplay a very rewarding experience, especially when the player reaches the end of the story.  I commend Microsoft for an outstanding job on this title, now I need to run out and buy Halo II.","Very Good, not great, excellent story line"

B0012N5MIO,3.0,"Usually, I don't review any items I haven't fully examined.  But after (finally!) getting a taste of this, I couldn't resist.  From what I've experienced firsthand, the long-awaited 'sequel' to the game that started the fighting genre is pretty much everything we expected, and more-or-less of what we wanted.

Inspired by a Japanese painting style, the '2.5D' graphics make SFIV a living canvas.  From Ryu's scorching fireball to the fighters' new Focus Attacks to their cinematic Ultra Moves, it's obvious that the franchise has come a long way since the long-forgotten EX series.  Speaking of special moves and combos, a joystick is still recommended if you ever want to execute them.  At least you can configure the controls to, for example, pull off 3-button attacks with one attack button.

It's great to see the 12 original World Warriors strut their stuff again.  And throwing 4 new characters, 6 fighters from ""Street Fighter Alpha,"" 2 secret characters, and a new boss sets the stage for new challenges and old rivalries.  So the only real gripe with SFIV is the $60 price tag.

This review will be revised with further testing of the product.

B00005R5PU,3.0,"Intially I bought this game becasue I was at Wal-mart, and I decided that I wasn't going to leave the store without a new game... meaning new to me, not NEW as in just came out. Anyway It was sitting there for 20 bucks, so I grabbed it and said, ""I wonder if this will be as bad as I think."" I took it home and put it away... we kinda forgot about it, and Christmas was coming so, since it was still unopened, I wrapped it and gave it to my wife for Christmas... She didn't apreciate it... The first level was actually kinda fun, but then it got to the surfing part... this part was more frustrating than X2, and you have stupid Rosie O'Donnel yelling at you the whole time... Half the time I remebered to mute the TV, but the other times I had to sit in complete annoyance. This all would have been semi-OK, except that extra lives are harder not to get than get, so I could never just GAME OVER my way out. After I got so annoyed at Rosie O'Donnel, that I focused my Chi enough to beat the surfing level I was thrust into the wonderfully bad WaterSki level... This one was even worse that the Surfing... Here a strange Giant bird pulls you Tarzan into rocks, ill-tempered bass and strange acid moss that kills you in two seconds... My wife had to leave the room at this point... the sound of Tarzan's bones cracking when he didn't make the jump over the many tree branches was too much for her, not to mention the fact that the bird would drag Tarzan's dead limp body through five or ten more obstacles before the level would reset. At this point I put the game away for about 5 months.
Two nights ago I had this strange urge to play Tarzan Untamed again... perhaps I having withdrawls from school being out and not having to babysit 7th graders all day... maybe I am just a glutton for punishment, but I poped Tarzan back in the Cube and went for it... this time the stars must have been in alignment because I kicked some trash... I got through Level after level with narry a thought for how frustrating and bored everyone else was getting watchign Tarzan smack into rocks and slide through green crystals (apparently Superman and Tarzan have an aversion to glowing green rocks). I ignored the cries of my wife and child and kept playing.
Around this time the game informed us that we needed to go back and find more Film reels, or else they wouldn't let us go to the ancient Elephant burial ground... I went back to the surfing and skiing levels,and My wife went on-line to look up divorce attorneys. After a few hundred hours of Tarzan testing his skull strength against rocks and trees; I had enough film to move on.
At this point I think it is important to mention the boss battles. These are one on one fights in the tradition of Street Fighter,and MK, but instead of fighting you furiously tap on the ""B"" button until it reveals your ""special wrestling move"" which you must perform in a matter of mere nano-seconds or else start the whole ""B"" pounding again... now this button pounding isn't smooth or easy like one might imagine after having played a Mario Party game, no, this is hardcore, your finger will hurt after the last two bosses pounding... in any case if you happen to pull off this feat of controlled magic Tarzan switched into a cut scene of him wrestling or running away, or whatever...
When I got to the third Bungee level (the Baboon one) I had to run to the bathroom-- the game had somehow given me diarreah. My wife tried the level a few times, while I expelled the entire contents of my digestive tract into the toilet. When I came back Tarzan was still falling hoplessly into trees and rocks... this didn't change much after I took the controls back. Eventually I got the all important Film Canister winning the respect of the Baboons. They take their film VERY seriously.
Ok... so Then I got to the last level (before the final ""boss"" battle) I go crusing through the level dodging kryptonite and saving baby monkeys only to find Turk or Tantor... whatever the elephants name is... standing there to tell me I needed to go back to the start of the level and find the ""real"" entrance to the Elephant Grave yard. I went back to the start and having won the trust andlove of my Baboon friends I was alble to gain entrance to the Elephant grave yard...Here I went on the final Boss battle where I had to ""fight"" two people at once... This ended with a cryptic cut-scene that I think promised me a better ending if I found all the film canisters...
All in all my marriage survived and I found that Tarzan really was worth the 20 bucks I spent 7 months ago in Wal-mart... did I mention that It was about 2 A.M. when I bought the game...
I give it a Z+ or a Q- depending on what scale you want to use...",Taming Tarzan Untamed

B000BNUXL2,3.0,"I definitely love some of the greatest challenges in sports video games. Well it might be all worth its money, there are times to where the game isn't worth the dollars it has been made out to be. FOr golf games, they've been mostly no acception. Although there have been highly successful editions like Mario Golf for the Nintendo Gamecube, that hasn't been chipped in with other games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour. That could possible be said with what needs to be percise for the Nintendo DS too. Although there has been many noticibles, could Nintnedo DS have a decent golf game of their own?

True Golf Swing for the Nintendo DS is a interesting kind of gold game, but it definitely doesn't have all the makings of a hole in one. The object of the game is very simple, you have to try to score big in your games and holes, inorder to unlock much more advanced levels and trickier courses. The control here in the game of course is completely conjured with the stylus. Here you need to use your stylus percisely, to make a great swing shot across the fairway. Although that might seem easy, it absolutely isn't. One wrong miss, and you'll be penalized with an extra stroke. The graphics does fair very well and the sound is definitely masterful toward each one of the courses in detail and design, but it isn't really enough to make it a must buy.

All in all, True Swing Golf isn't one of the best games out there for the Nintendo DS, but it is good for die hard golf fans. For others who have a realistic desire to make a hole in one, I absolutely suggest that Nintendo DS owners wait for a better golf game to eagle with.

I was very disappointed that we can't use the 360 controller, which we do with Skyrim.  I can use the keyboard, just don't enjoy it and my husband says his fingers are too big  and has no interest in using one so we have the game and I started it but stopped after about an hour.  I even tried a couple of control software but for us, it's not as much fun as just playing Skyrim.

B0009Z3K9O,3.0,"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into.  Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great.  And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems.  Sometimes scary problems.  Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so.  But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.

Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way.  Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception.  He looks a little like Alucard.

But we're not here to discuss that.  Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers.  Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of  Valachia.  Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in.  He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved.  If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge.  And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome.  And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot.  The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story.

Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania.  This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania.  You explore a large castle riddled with goodies.  This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more.

Playing the game can be quite fun.  Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters.  That isn't as boring as you might think.  You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the circle button.  You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos.  This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without.  Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em.  Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that.  Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing.  This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage.  Again, you must be locked on for it to happen.

Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system.  In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time.

You also have little helper monsters.  You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon.  They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do.  It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone.  Each enemy also drops evolution crystals.  Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve.  You won't grow to like them, though.  That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay.  The monsters have special abilities, though.  Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground.  But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same.  You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve.

One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons!  And Hector can do it at any time he wants!  That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it!  Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger.  You can do this simply by opening the menu.  I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that.

The weapons have their own little downside however.  With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat.  You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use.  Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon ""type"".  This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points.  Unless you're a person who likes to use ""cool"" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun.

It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle.  Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia.  Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more.  So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change.

The problem with this ""world"" is that you don't see enough of it.  There's not enough detail to it.  You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at.  The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments.  You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over.  If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those ""looping"" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle.

The monsters are also not so great.  What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters.  The attacks they use on you.  Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect.  Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety.  You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new.  Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new.  Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on.  The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all!  They'll never change.

I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not.  It takes away from the challenge of the game.  The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true.  And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge.  The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all.  The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy.  Later on, however, they get  start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun.  Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try.

I wish I could say the graphics are great.  Hey, Hector looks great in combat.  But the enviroments don't have enough detail.  Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now.  Where's the detail?  You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving?  We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting.  Visually, it doesn't look half bad.  It's just that there could be so much more.  The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail.

However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME!  As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming!  Is it better than Symphony of the Night?  No, it's not.  It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game.  Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD!  I just wish I could've heard more of it!

Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game.  But there are a lot of things that keep it down.  It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation.  You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games.  It's got nothing that makes it stick out.

If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop.  If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of ""Dawn of Sorrow"".  It's a much better game.

The Good:
+Great Music!  Some of the best in gaming!
+Good weapon system
+It's pretty fun to play
+You can steal from enemies!
+Great Voice acting!

The Bad
-Little innovation
-Lack of cutscenes to advance the story
-Too much of the game gets recycled too fast
-Too easy
-The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments
-Not a whole lot of different enemies
-It's too easy
-Boring level designs (not enough of them)
-You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation!  It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D game

Get Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game.  They seem to fare so much better than this one does.  Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland.",The Curse of 3D Castlevania Games!

B00KWHJ2JQ,3.0,"Daughter and I enjoyed the original series, thought I would make Santa surprise her with this series and most of the characters (I don't touch the toy box only characters, they're pretty worthless).  The series is enjoyable with its 3 playsets, even if the play sets seem to be a little shorter/smaller than the ones from the 1.0 series.  Overall though, I'm somewhat disappointed in the 2.0 game.  It doesn't bring anything new to the table.  Although the 3 boss fights do seem to be much harder (than in the 1.0 version).  Otherwise, just more of the same; 3 play sets, and you're all done with the game, other than doing the sets over again.  Yes, you can play in the toy box mode, but really, that's just wasting time that you could use to do other fun things.  My daughter still enjoys this series (she's 9) and I jump in from time to time with her (I generally dislike replaying a game/movie/etc), but its fun enough to go back from time to time.

If Disney had any brains, they'd have released additional play worlds as DLC.  While I generally despise DLC/IAP, for this game (and 1.0) I would buy like crazy.

I've played on almost every home console
so my point of view should hold some value
My first console wasn't the PSOne

SNK/Neo Geo is such a shell of there former shelf when you look at there amazing work in the 1990's
even when they lost there mind with a Super Over Priced Arcade Home Console  in Neo Geo
There brand still was pure gold as of late not so much
I was able to pick up Samurai Showdown Sen for a great price so i figured why not it's a SNK title for the 360
it's a 360 Exclusive must be somewhat HQ
it's a train wreck
maybe the game was out-sourced to  Xseed Games
Everyone involved really did a terrible job with this title  SNK at one time could do Arcade games like no other (They have a back catalog of titles that's impressive) They dusted off Samurai Showdown  to try and re-boot it
take it out of the classic 2D Fighting realm
and put it with the like of Tekken and MK9 in a mix between 2D and 3D Fighters!
Which isn't a terrible idea but, something just didn't transfer over in the final product

Graphics
The game looks outdated even in 2015 (a lot of 360 titles still look extremely good) this game looks like a DreamCast title sometimes it looks really good other times it looks flat out ugly and washed out  (I Love the Dreamcast still to this day this game isn't good enough to be on the DC)

The Controls  A+
the controls are one of the best things about the game
Once you get the hang of the controls and how to play it's a somewhat easy pick up and play title  (Not as easy as DOA but, not as complex as a Street Fighter title)

One thing I'll give the game developers credit for is the use of the M
this is the first Samurai title to ever get a Mature rating
It's actually very violent has more gore then I would've expected SNK isn't known for doing Mature rated games
This might be the first SNK title to ever get the ESRB  ratting of Mature

The Gameplay is there it's not classic SNK Arcade pick up and go style
it's more trying to be like the big boys like Soul Calibur, MK,  and DOA
some game mode will not work (all the online are defunct they were offline a few years ago when i tried to get the 1000 gamer scores of the disc)
you'll get 65% of the gaming Achievements without the online mode
The story mode gets old fast

There are much worse games out there that have you grind for 100+ hrs and you get nothing (like Destiny)
you can put like 6-8 hrs into this title get all the  Achievements that are possible (then sell it, trade it in, donate it whatever)

B001UU1WTC,3.0,"I'm probably showing my age here, but I bought the Madden games faithfully year after year for various gaming platforms for a looooong time before stopping about 5 years ago. I bought 2010 anticipating the magic of past editions, but this one falls short even though it is still okay.

It is quite complex now and the learning curve is steep if you haven't played in years. The myriad of choices you can make in the way of audibles is abundant. You have to ensure you have a lot of time to devote to learning all the details if you expect to provide any competition whatsoever to other people online. Additionally, the graphics are good, but not what you may expect from the 360 after playing first person shooters like COD. There are a few kinks as well. When you go for it on 4th down and fail, the voice-over will tell you its now 4th down. Of course, if you fail, it is 1st down for the other team. Not a huge ding, but they could have cleaned up that easy mistake when debugging the game. The voice-overs also have a considerable pause between speaking a teams name and the rest of any given sentence. It reminds me of older generations of games that tried to personalize the game by speaking specifically about a team or player and doesn't sound even close to natural talking.

If given the choice again I would just rent it if that was an option or just waited for one of the big games coming out this fall (Modern Warfare 2, Bad Company 2, Flashpoint, etc...). I will probably play it from time to time on weekends before/after a game on tv, but I can't see it being a game that you can't stop playing because it is so fun.

B00005NHAI,3.0,"Given that this game is ""based"" on the military simulation, I thought it would be a pretty cool game.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  It didn't live up to my expectations.  Once you figure out how and what units to build, it becomes trivial to conquer the enemy.  In several days I had conquered all of the missions except one.  Skirmishes got boring.
On the plus side, this game features remarkably good graphics.  Seeing your attack helicopters unloading missiles, and terrorists/infantry units doing back flips when hit with artillery is kind of fulfilling given today's current events.
This game does have some limitations, though.
Units tend to get stuck, and give up when you order them to a point across the terrain.  If any obstacles are in their path, you sometimes have to guide them.  I found the hovercrafts (which can carry heavy vehicles across water) especially difficult to control.  When tasked with loading vehicles, sometimes they just wander off.
There are limitations on what you can build, and it isn't clearly documented what units or buildings are prerequisites for building other units.  I found out through trial and error.

B00FLLFJE0,3.0,"Great product. The actual charger itself is cheaper feeling than the 360 version used to be, but it works. I'm not sure why so many have issues putting the batteries in, the battery pack itself clearly states which direction to have the batteries in when you insert it. Only part that I could see confusing would be that the left side of the battery (when viewing it right side up to insert), the tab side needs to be inserted first or you would have to fight it. The battery won't fit upside down at all, which is probably where people are having problems. The cover snaps right on and both batteries worked in my controllers out of the box. When seating the controllers, they don't just fall onto the 3 electrical connections, you sort of have to either be eyeballing the controller to see that its level, or just be watching the remote icon on the front light up when it has made the connection. Not a major drawback, but compared to the 360 where I could just drop it in and it would slide home, it is a slight design flaw.

As for battery life, I will edit this in a few weeks after my winter break as to how well they hold up to hours of use/ average battery life. As is, I definitely recommend them.

As another note, it does use a wall charger, so be sure you have another :( open outlet spot. Additionally, whether you used it or not on the 360, the version for the One no longer has a front USB plug in. I loved having this on the 360 charger, but if you didn't use it on that one, you won't miss it here.

***1 month after owning and using extensively over holiday break***

Definitely be cautious of buying this if you plan any extensive gaming sessions. You're lucky to get 8 hours out of one battery fully charged. While this might be expected given it is not a lithium battery, it is just unfortunate to get such short life out of a product. For short spurts and casual gaming, no reason to not purchase this product. However, if you plan to have even the occasional longer gaming session you might want an alternative. Nyko does make a plug and play product, however, you have to have those separate batteries which would not work with this station... Also, my headset plugs directly into my TV/Xbox for power, however if you have a headset which uses your remotes power, I would expect far less hours of play than even 8. I have already ordered one of the Microsoft plug/play lithium batteries to put into one of my two controllers for my longer sessions, and will save my second Nyko battery as a backup for the other. Hope this helps anyone as there aren't a lot of long term reviews.

For those wondering, my change of rating has nothing to do with installing the Nyko batteries..I have no understanding of why that is confusing to so many of the other reviewers to install.",Original vs 1 month later review.
B00004TSXC,3.0,"If I could think of a way to best describe Neverwinter Nights, it would be Diablo meets Baldur's Gate. The game is made by the same people that designed Baldur's Gate but it's more of a mainstream ""hack and slash"" adventure than an epic RPG. Don't get me wrong, the in-game story is great but it just doesn't feel like a classic RPG. One reason for this might be because of the easy-to-use Aurora Toolset. If you've ever messed around with PC game editors, this one will probably be the easiest custom content maker you'll ever use. It was designed that way so that D&D fans everywhere could quickly create their own adventures. (The game even allows you to act as a Dungeon Master with your spiffy new adventures.) Unfortunately, the official adventure included with Neverwinter Nights also uses the same toolset that was designed for ""Joe Schmoe"" and something probably gets lost in the process because each map uses the same same grid design and 3-D structures. Frankly, most maps just feel the same and after all is said and done, the offical campaign in NWN comes across as an average gaming experience. Keep in mind too that while it's very easy to place items and creatures with the toolset, you'll need a basic knowledge of programming to script actions in your module. If you're convinced that this game is for you, check out the newer Neverwinter Nights Gold which comes with the original game as well as the first expansion (Shadows of Undrentide). You may even want to wait a little longer because the second and last expansion (Hordes of the Underdark) just came out and undoubtedly, it will soon be packaged in a newer ""platinum"" edition. Make sure you check the official Bioware website so that you can download one of the many custom adventures designed by gamers. There is also a fairly large online community and many gamers have set up their own servers that are up and running 24/7 for online D&D fun. I had a good time with Neverwinter Nights, but not everyone may find the game as enjoyable, especially if they don't like online play or the easy-to-use toolset. If you enjoy the feel and gameplay of NWN, it has an extremely long lifespan because of the online community, but many gamers don't find the game that appealing to begin with.","It's a Niche Game, Not Everyone Will Enjoy It Like I Did"
B000GE7O9K,3.0,"Great controls in this game.  There are so many different things you can do and the controls are set up very well for a real-time RPG on a console.

There are so many ways you can replay this game with different character types.  It is not linear by any means, but can be if you want it to.  It's entirely up to how you want to play.  It really sets the bar for other games of this type in many ways.  The world is giant.  There are so many places to go and missions to accomplish.  It's crazy.

There is one big problem I see with this game: The creatures you fight get tougher as you advance in level.  This is a real deterrent to making you want to level up.  Imagine fighting a wolf as a new level 1 character with no problem and then getting to level 7 and having the same wolf easily kill you.  As you gained 6 levels and all the experience and skills that go along with them, the wolf gets equally tough.  How does a wolf train to become equally better?  Does the wolf go to jujitsu school???  So as you advance, it becomes increasingly tougher just to get to your next mission location because a wolf comes up and bites you from behind and you're outta there.  A wolf should not gain experience the way your character does.  In just about any RPG, the wolf would maintain its level of difficulty and as you get better, killing a wolf becomes like squashing an ant. I can accept tougher creatures as you advance (ie demons, dragons, the undead, etc...), but not wolves getting tougher.

Anyhow, if you advance too quickly, the game becomes impossible.  It's easier to play all the way through without advancing beyond level 3.  But then you don't get to learn and use all the skills of the higher level characters.  As a result, the game can become somewhat repetitive.

I heard this problem is remedied in Fallout (which uses the same game system).

In the next Oblivion, fixing this issue alone will make it so no RPG can touch it (unless someone comes up with an MMORPG version of Oblivion for the 360).  But until then, it's not the greatest.",Fun game

B00HGLLRV2,3.0,"This game is more of a demonstration of what the PS4 can do than a thrilling game. It is entertaining at times, but on the whole, I don't think this was a very well made game.

Graphics: Stunning! Great particle effects and very detailed textures. Detailed city, but the city isn't that well designed, and the areas do not feel very unique.

Story: This story was bad, really bad. The protagonist is difficult to identify with because he's a jerk to everyone he meets, and the story is just a revenge quest of sorts. The additional characters introduced along the way are quickly forgotten because they don't have much personality, and the end of the game is disappointing to say the least.

Gameplay: It's kind of fun to fly around the city with different powers, but managing those powers is kind of a pain. You can unlock several different powers, and each of them acts quite differently..so differently that they change how you play the game. This is a clever mechanic, but the feeling of progression doesn't exist much here, since it's difficult or impossible to switch between powers on the fly, and the unlocks you get are only for one power. In the end, you're left with many different powers but none of them feel very well rounded. Finally, even when you play the entire game as a ""good guy"" you never really feel that ""good"" about yourself. The story progresses much the same no matter what decisions you make, so I don't feel like it's worth playing through twice.

Multiplayer: There is no multiplayer. That seems like a missed opportunity.","Great graphics, poor story, characters, and gameplay"
B0012N3T3Y,3.0,"I greatly enjoyed Resistance: Fall of Man for its avoidance of common game cliches, brilliant story telling approach, and solid gameplay, in a wonderful environment.

Resistance 2 however is not that game, this is a lead-by-the-nose journey through a graphical wonderland with little in the way of freeform gameplay, full of cliches from past games and lacking any sort of natural flow.

For example I died 40+ times when fighting the walker near the start before figuring out that I had to walk through a gate that is opened as part of a scripted sequence involving a commander telling me where to go - many more scripted sequences followed this, with equally contrived situations.

Resistance 2 feels exactly like a Call of Duty 4 clone (right down to the health system, and escaping from a tilting naval vessel), very disappointing compared to the logical and well-designed Resistance before it, making it worse is the fact it introduces new plot holes in what was a solid story before.

All this said, Resistance 2 is a graphical extravaganza, I've never seen such well-done environment modeling of the american West Coast before (almost life-like representations of the forests I live near), and there are some really cool gimmick-driven sequences throughout the game, like fighting a boss while standing on a helicopter landing platform that is being buffeted by waves (from the boss!), great stuff, unlike anything I've seen before - but the actual core gameplay falls a bit flat.

The puzzles really aren't that hard, and God knows they give you enough hints and clues for most of the puzzles.  However, like the other Adventure Company games I've played, it is heavy on inventory, and there are at least two items that are hard to find - especially if you don't realize you're supposed to be looking for them!

The graphics are absolutely gorgeous - possibly the best I've ever seen (and, as a Myst veteran, that's saying a lot!).  However, I wish game companies would stop using computer-generated people.  They always - and I mean always - look awful.  They really should stick to live actors.

The music is very heavily synthesized, and comes across as heavily pretentious.  (The music for the third world of Na-Tiexu reminds me of Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"".)  Then again, maybe I'm just spoiled after hearing Tim Larkin's wonderful scores for Uru and Myst V.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Far Cry 2 is essentially the Assassin's Creed of the non-linear FPS genre. It has huge potential, but once again Ubisoft has managed to squander near-infinite resources on what ultimately amounts to basically a tech demo. I once thought Crysis was nothing more than a showpiece for the CryEngine, but now through the lens of Far Cry 2 I see that there was much deeper gameplay in Crysis than I originally gave it credit for.

To rehash the story: you're a mercenary in an unnamed sub-Saharan African nation. It basically looks like a Sierra Leone or an Angola; civil war marked by Western fuel for natural resources. You're sent in with the vague mission of killing an arms dealer, but the story soon becomes mired down in the player's actions in relation to armed factions, other mercenaries, and his battle with malaria.

The story, while seemingly effective at first, ultimately boils down to you doing missions for one of two armed factions to advance the plot. And that is when the lackluster gameplay begins. At first it seems fun: go here, kill this person; go there, blow this up. But after a few missions you'll realize that Ubisoft either did not invest in beta testers, or did not let them play for long sessions. In short, the gameplay is ridiculously repetitive, to the point of boredom within hours of starting a campaign.

And to top the completely repetitive nature of the game off is the fact that many of the game mechanics are poor by design. To begin with, you must manually travel (save a very poorly and sparsely implemented 'bus' system) in between every location on the map. This is no Oblivion, where you could warp between locations once you had been to them prior. Furthermore, you will spend approximately half of your gameplay staring at the oh-so-realistic 'magic' map, which, while intuitive, is kind of drag to have to use to navigate anywhere and everywhere. But even the boredom and tediousness of looking at a map while going anywhere cannot compare to the biggest sin of the navigation system: enemy checkpoints. Here you will have to stop, fight three or four enemies, scavenge around the checkpoint and wash, rinse, repeat every three to five minutes while on the move. It becomes incredibly dull and mundane after the first few encounters, and this is compounded by the fact all enemies respawn instantly after you leave an area. It's a laughable concept from the late 90s.

Furthermore, while battling it out in one of the hundreds of inconvenient and completely predictable checkpoint encounters, you'll probably notice how little thought was given to combat. There is no prone (a major flaw for an environment so based on natural camouflage), there are no lean commands, you cannot even jump very effectively. The controls remind me of the original Half-Life, except here it is almost unforgivable that a game so obsessed with ""the most realistic experience possible"" cannot even include the ability to go flat in the grass. But the biggest flaw of combat is the laughable amounts of ammo you will use trying to kill even one man. Nothing screams realism to me more than having to empty 7-10 rounds from an assault rifle into someone's bare chest before they keel over, only to need a few more to finish the job. Instead of making the AI smart enough to pose an actual logical challenge, Ubisoft just increased the health of the enemies to comical levels, and then gave them x-ray vision and supersonic hearing to boot. Stealth, as a gameplay mechanic, is a complete waste of time; a sniper rifle will make you a god.

Everything about the gameplay in Far Cry 2 screams under-implemented. Add that to a laundry list of cosmetic fallacies- every weapons dealer is the exact same, nearly every interior of every house is the same, repetitive character models, the inclusion of the stick in standard transmission Jeeps which are driven like automatics, weapon models are all left-handed but held on the right side like CS, enemies say the same lines over and over, etc. - and you have a pretty underwhelming playing experience. I've seen a lot of reviews which try to justify the repetitive and downright boring experience offered by Far Cry 2 as a ""side-effect"" of sandbox gaming, but that's just nonsense. Just because FC2 isn't linear doesn't mean everything you do has to be redundant by design; S.T.A.L.K.E.R. felt more refined then this and it had just as many deep flaws.

I guess playing Far Cry 2 ultimately left me feeling betrayed once again by Ubisoft. They take ideas which should make awesome video games, hype them up to near-Messianic proportions, and then drop a product which could have been great with six months more development time in the customer's lap. This was painful enough with Assassin's Creed, but here it's too much to bear. Far Cry 2 could have been a visceral, enthralling experience, a model of non-linear gaming and a milestone for the industry. Instead Far Cry 2 is one of the biggest disappointments I can recall in recent gaming history, and will ultimately leave you feeling bored, frustrated, or thinking of what could have been.

That's not to say that it's all bad. Far Cry 2 is a very pretty game, and runs much better than Crysis on many rigs. The African savanna/jungle is well-done, and the sounds of the game aren't half bad either. But the gameplay feels rushed, the multiplayer is a jokingly bad experience that even console gamers should feel ashamed about, and the story is a big ""Who cares?"" at the end of the day. But perhaps the worst factor is that this game will have no major update, no major patch. Ubisoft is notorious for dropping half-finished work on the customer and then never addressing community concerns. Maybe the FOV issue with widescreen monitors will be addressed, but that is shameful in that such an issue even exists. As far as completely over-hauling the combat system and making this game less tedious, forget about it.

In conclusion, the best thing that could come of Far Cry 2 is a mod fixing the problems so inherent with its half-baked style right now. However, while Far Cry 2 does include a rather robust map editor (a big plus), I have heard that the SDK might not be released to the public. This would be classic Ubisoft; never lifting a finger to fix their own products, they also refuse to let go of ""intellectual"" property rights and let the community fix the game themselves, which is a real shame when you consider flaws like the complete and total lack of any server browser for multiplayer (I know I said I wouldn't divulge too much on the MP experience, but come on, this is a PC game, right?).

Far Cry 2 is a lesson in what could have been. Six months more development and this game could have been one for the record books, instead of a tech demo for the Dunia engine and a gameplay experience equivalent to a mindless shooter of yesteryear. This is 2008, soon to be 2009; we're in an age of games like COD4, Crysis, even HL2 and its derivatives. Ubisoft - you need to step it up.","Oh, What Could Have Been!"
B00M3D8ISS,3.0,"The game itself is great, but this is not about the games content but about how Bethesda sells it to you. First of all when you get the DVD boxed version you get ONLY one disc, that's right. The reason for that is so they can make more $$$.

+ Sniper mode trigger pressure meter is pretty cool

here's is the games signature(it isn't riding beasts, been there, done that):  in any game, typically when you enter a button sequence for a combo, the attack animation plays out no matter what, leaving you open for damage.  in this game, however, you can cancel out of a combo with a parry/evade button press, whichever is most appropriate.  in my opinion this is very refreshing.

However, DR2:OTR didn't try and call itself a sequel. It was something like a third of the cost of a full game, and yet it brought more additional story than this SR4 does from SR3. Where missions in SR3 were very story driven and unique, it seems most of the missions in SR4 simply point you to what were side missions in SR3.

Good Things:
-The game is nice if you're bored of the same old pokemon games and their battling techniques.
-The games texture and graphics are a good improvement from other GBA games.
-The game is long and challenging.
Bad Things:
-The game can become extremely frustrating. Why? Many reasons.
1. Whenever you enter the net, you come across viruses or enemies, to make it simple. They are challenging at first, but in the later stages when you become powerful, they are just plain annoying, especially when you're trying to accomplish long, tedious missions given to you by the game. You must have an escape chip to actually escape! You can only hold 30 chips in your ""moves"" folder. So if you have, for example, 2, your chances of getting them and escaping battles you don't want is 2/30. You get 5 chips per turn that you skip and press ADD during your chip selection. Think about it.
2. The cost of items in this game is way too high, in my opinion. As a player in a RPG game, you would like to improve your weapons so you can defeat your enemies faster/easier right? Well, try to when it takes 10,000zens just to get one M Cannon, which does 120 damage. The common later viruses have like 200hp. The beginning bosses are about 600+. Therefore you need more than 1 powerful chip. How long would it take? Say forever?
3. Oh yeah, chip combos are made by putting same letter chips together. Example, two different chips with the letter L next to it, say Cannon Chip L and Dash Chip L. You can select it both at once and use it without the need to wait for the bar to fill up to select more chips. Its really hard to make the combos and play fast when you gotta check out the letters next to each chip to see if you can play it together. The letter range is long!
4. The missions are nice, IF YOU KNOW HOW TO GET IT! They seem to expect you to know exactly where to go. Well they don't Mr. Creator! Therefore, what you either do is get FAQS or wonder around, mindlessly and extremely frustrated, until you find where you need to go. Got Milk?
5. The only real fun is raising Megaman, upgrading him which is hell, and fighting the bosses and people with powerful P.E.Ts. Megaman is a PET. This is where it *beeped* up. Its usually rare or it takes a horribly ammount of time and work to finally encounter those few people. The rest of the game is filled with viruses that aren't challenging and you can't simply escape easily.

B00001ZWPB,3.0,"Asteroids Hyper is an okay game overall. However, it does has some flaws. First of all is that it's not a game that will keep you interested for hours at a time. It's also pretty difficult sometimes to keep your ship on track and avoid asteroids and comets. Another problem are the UFOs that come by. The big ones are hardly even worth the effort and one would wonder why they even bothered putting them in the game. The smaller ones aren't that much better. They're a whole lot more difficult than anything else in the game (except for bosses) because they are almost impossible to his and will almost always destroy you with their first shot. This makes them very frustrating to kill. The sound isn't exactly top-notch. The music is definetly not good and there is none during the game itself. However, the whole game does have the classic arcade feel to it and that's hard to beat. There are also  things that make life in the asteroid belt a little easier to bear like power-ups and shields (although the shields hardly last very long, but it can make a difference).

B000BNKX9O,3.0,"Naruto Clash of Ninja is the first game. It has a simple story mode and a small roster of playable characters (about 10) for real value of the game which is the multiplayer.

Naruto 2 Clash of Ninja is the second game. It starts with the same story as what the first game had but continues much further beyond. Also the voice acting, graphics, dialog, presentation, menus, etc are all improved from the first game. The gameplay is mostly the same but more refined and lots of game modes are added including 4-player multiplayer. The roster of playable characters is also increased to over 20 and the additional fighters provide a lot more diversity to the fighting game.

Basically Naruto 2 has everything the first game has including the first ones story and all playable characters from the first as well as tons of new stuff so if your considering getting this game... than do yourself a favor and get the second one.

I am not saying this first game is bad... it is just obsolete after the release of the second one.",Great fighter but get Naruto 2 instead
B0021TVYCG,3.0,"I'm not sure where to begin on this.  It's been a long time since Oblivion came out and...well...to be honest it's gotten to where I've played it as much as it can be played.  Two Worlds 2 seemed like a promising fill-in until Skyrim is released and the devs were making claims of having listened to the customers and changed the game entirely from the absolute abortion that the original Two Worlds was.

The good:  Not a lot of difficulty in choosing what your character is going to look like.  He's got the same stupid braid in his hair no matter what color skin or eyes you give him...and you can make him taller or shorter.  This could be a bad, I suppose...but...meh...I honestly can't think of anything that stands out as superb in this game so far.

The bad:  Oh...where to begin.

Controls:  Clunky.  ...that d*mn ""X"" button that's used for jump AND to activate things.  Menu stays open after you loot a treasure chest or go shopping...how freaking annoying is that?  The ""X"" button that doesn't actually do anything when you REALLY want it to.  ""Push X to open chest""  Nothing happens.  Get a little closer.  Same.  Get a little closer.  Same.  Step back to start over and step into a campfire.  Want to press ""X"" to open a door while moving?  Good luck.  Want to press ""X"" to talk to an NPC that will cause a sequence?  Sorry...have to step forward into the little square the game wants so it can activate a cut scene.

Graphics:  Meh...GI Joes doing Broadway.  Arm movements are jerky...and, like I said, these guys look like you can clip a sword or whatever weapon you want in between their fingers and thumb.  Lips don't move in time to voices.  Oh...which takes us to sound.

Sound:  Voice acting...THE HORROR!  ""Hi...my name is generic hero guy...you're going to be finding yourself frantically hitting the button to skip past the cutscenes because it sounds like I've been smoking since I was three years old.  It's obviously also made my joints a little stiff...because I move like a GI Joe that you left out in the rain...that once shiny screw inside the hole in my back will now leave a little rusty spot on that peg on all of your backpacks and radio equipment.  Attach a sword and watch me swing in the same moves over and over like Obi Wan Kinobi from Episode 1...another event promising epic win and delivering mediocrity.

Auto-save.  Really?  I was jerking around after I finally figured out where I needed to go (because the flag and navigation system in this game is absolute balls) and managed to come across some enemies FINALLY!  FINALLY!!!  I get to roam and kill stuff...YEAAAAHHHHH!  I kill a few, level up, open some chests (oh, SOB the lockpicking...more on that in a minute) and then out of nowhere this little goblin (called something else in this game...but they're goblins) comes out of nowhere and Mark McGuires me from full health to nothing.  Yeah...that ""AutoSave"" that kept popping up in the corner must have just been screwing with me.  Started out back before I ever started exploring...at level 2 again.  At least I didn't have to suffer through the clunky tutorials and horrendous voice acting a second time...hopefully I don't have much storyline to suffer through.

Lockpicking:  I wasn't thrilled with Oblivion's lockpicking...but it was WAY better than this.  Half the time I click when I'm lined up with the ""notch"" and I miss.  Friggen crappy controls!!!

This...is a game you're going to want to wait on and get when it's down to about $29.99.  Then you'll have yourself a deal.  Better yet, pick it up used.  If there's a Two Worlds 3 I'll not be burned a third time.",What a waste...

B00DEL3IIS,3.0,"When I first got into really playing this I was loving it, very fun, addictive, fantastic graphics, but after playing it I started to realize that it was going to suffer the same issues as Destiny. I was having fun up until about level 5, 6 where I started to realize that I was beginning to be under leveled very fast as my guns had to use more and more ammo, the enemies were beginning to become more and more bullet sponge-y, and I was finding that I couldn't do more and more of the solo missions so I had to go into mp and find other agents... which took on avg. 10-15min which really slowed down the game for me. The more I played the more repetitive the missions got, fight these guys, kill the boss, go through the same building fighting the same enemies to get yet another virus report, on and on and on. I then got to about lvl. 11 where I was under leveled about 5-10 levels and getting other agents was a pain the butt because everyone else like me was too under leveled and thus you couldn't get higher leveled players to join you, and at this point I pretty much quit. I was totally fine playing solo but to get more resources to build the city back those missions w/ more resources I was way under leveled, you'd have to play the small very low payout missions many, many times over to lvl up. The other issue is that guns are very under leveled and tied to your lvl, if The Division was properly designed I would be able to purchase a higher end gun from sold loot to be able to play the higher leveled missions.

Story was ok and was hard to care about it as you get cutscenes very few and far between. As much as I wanted to get into the Dark Zone as it sounded really fun, I attempted and completely failed at it because it's literally impossible to until about lvl 30 which is the max cap. I attempted it at lvl 11 and was killed w/in literal seconds by the fist enemies I came across so as I quit at lvl 11 I was never able to get really into there and everyone will have to play a LOT of this game just to be able to hold your own.

Too much repetition, waaay too hard to go solo, bullet sponge-y enemies, there's all of about 3 different enemies, game is really fun and addictive for a bit but suffers too many issues for me to continue. I'd recommend if you have a group to roll w/ or else you'll be stuck about a week or 2 in.",Fun for a while until.....
B00HTK1NCS,3.0,The build quality is very mediocre and the mouse has an odd texture.,"If you are looking for comfort, this is not it."
B001TOQ8R0,3.0,"AC2 brought about the same kind of gameplay with very minor changes. It's about twice as long as the first game, with a routine of combing the cities for whatever is left in them, including the eagle feathers, which are basically hard to find gimmick items like flags in the previous game. Finding the feathers unlocks some features, which unfortunately are too negligible to make up for the time wasted. Locations of the feathers are not indicated on the map, which means that finding the whole one hundred of them is the hardest task in this game. You can still climb towers to unlock viewpoints and covered areas on the map as well as points of interest and merchants.

There are 3 kinds of merchants: healers, blacksmiths, and art sellers.
You can earn and spend money, the renaissance Italy version of money I think although I don't remember it having any particular name. Speaking of money, there are many treasure chests located throughout the game, which can be sought after for the sake of, again, `finding them all' and some spare change, but the money is unfortunately in abundance long before all the treasure chests are found.

The story is quite lengthy and includes a number of revelations, either of personal, to the character, or other kind. It's a matter of personal preference whether the story and revelations are interesting or cliche, I personally liked it. At the beginning you're just a young guy in Florence, from a wealthy family albeit a borderline criminal by today's standards and freely running the streets.
The bad guys in the story unfortunately are bland and obvious to the point of looking thuggish and serving only as a target practice.

The grand story is told primarily through cut scenes and an additional CGI sequence, which is unlocked through deciphering various `glyphs' hidden in the game world. I'll come back to this in a moment.

Now, the idea of the revelation unlocked by finding the `glyphs' is a good one, it's the execution of this idea, which is terrible. After finding a glyph you're basically presented with a series of ugly puzzles on a black background completely unrelated to anything else in the game. They include some pictures from history, e.g. a photo of an atomic bomb explosion, a picture of a tank during WW2, as well as primitive Monty Python-style cut-paste animation. The puzzles themselves range from very easy to hard. The biggest travesty of all is that they take you out of the game thus breaking immersion... (there is a stupid `find the apple [of Eden?] in the picture' in half of those puzzles.

There is also another kind of `puzzle' in the game, the GOOD one.
They are Assassins' Tombs, which are the best part of this game, IMO. They are in a sense puzzles of physical nature in which you are required to get to a particularly hard-to-get and very remote location within a building or a dungeon. These locations contain items used to unlock something that I won't spoil here...
Trying to find your way up (or down) to progress in those is fun and most of the time more exciting than the repetitive and ""impossible-to-die-in"" combat.

Combat is repetitive and despite not being able to control your moves correctly most of the time very easy, just how it was in the original AC. There were very few additions if any compared to the original.
Regarding killing people, I could relate to being a mercenary assassin in the previous game. Here, they introduced the main character as someone who's killing out of vengeance and ridiculously enough the head count of his victims at the end of the game is many times higher than what the bad guys did (combined).

Cut scenes are sometimes interactive as in oftentimes during a scene you are prompted to press a button to perform an additional action like shaking hands, etc. those actions are irrelevant to the outcome of a particular sequence and can be disregarded. As a matter of fact I couldn't do any of them because you only have a few seconds to hit a button after you see a prompt, which together with the horrid control scheme for keyboard and mouse and my bad reflexes made it impossible.

While the countryside is very limited, city environments are beautiful and vast. For example imagine Venice at night, when there is a full moon over one of many canals there and you look up at it and an eerie music starts playing and your jaw literally drops. The cities are larger this time. Venice alone is probably as big as the original Damascus and Jerusalem put together and has more variety, too.

NPC related annoyances from the original game are here as well: when the guy is running through alleys or streets and runs into people most of the time he trips over and falls down but they don't. Basically he can climb and jump on the rooftops like Spiderman but dodging standing pedestrians while running, quite slowly at that, is beyond his abilities. Adding more ""challenge"" by hurting realism is a no-no in my book.

In the same vain, traveling on the ground is now preferable to running through the rooftops because the rooftop guards ""agro"" at much longer distance than the ground guards... and are on every roof now. When you're incognito, you can walk side by side with the ground guards without detection but you are always shot-on-sight by the roof guards.

Help (in-game prompts) for keyboard and mouse control scheme is nonexistent. In fact the prompts you see are for the controller, which makes it confusing if you're not using one.

B001AWBYNE,3.0,Let me start by saying I had no intention of buying COD5.  When it was first announced I was automatically turned off by the fact that it was yet another WWII game.  My friends bought it and said it was fun...so I got a copy.  I wasn't very impressed with the online play.  Going from modern weapons to pea shooters wasn't my idea of fun.  I found a few of the maps too large for 6v6 play and they would be more fitted for 8v8.  Sure they can make smaller maps but the game isn't fun enough to sit around and wait for them.  I noticed that you have to lead your enemy by aiming ahead of them when shooting from 10 feet away (hence the pea shooter remark made earlier).  The tanks are underpowered and shooting  directly next to a guy who is behind a wall won't even kill him (you have to shoot next to him since the TANK can't shoot through buildings or trees but some guns can).  The respawn points in COD5 are the worst I've seen since Rainbow Six Vegas 2. Even though I didn't enjoy the MP that much I actually had fun playing campaign co-op.  I tried to go back and play the game again but wasn't able to play more than 15 minutes.  So with the not so good replay value of the SP and MP modes I gave this game a three.  Since I've been watching a lot Killzone 2 videos I can't bring myself to play much of anything these days and COD5 was supposed to be my 'filler game' until Killzone 2 comes out.  COD5 is by far a 'filler game' and should be rented at best.  Save whatever money you were going to spend on this and use it towards Killzone 2.,Not the 'Filler Game' I was hoping for
B00004UDVL,3.0,"This game functions real well as a starter RPG. More experienced RPG gamers might be a little bored with its shortcomings. The are four reasons for this: The story line, the linear game play, the semi-real time battle sequence, and the lack of any real challenge.
Story: The story fails almost completely in both presentation and substance. The main character is Ryudo. He is a mercenary with a troubled past sent out on a job to protect the pure good girl of the land. (Now where have we seen that before?) Of course you see where this is going...Ryudo uncovers his past and finds strength from within to stop fighting for money and start fighting for justice. Now, the story itself isn't bad per se, but the thing is, we have heard it all before. If you take two or three classic RPGs (any will do) and piece together the story lines you get this one. So, if you are new to RPGs then it will be new to you so you won't be bothered by it. However, RPGs are special because unlike other video games they rely heavily on the story. RPG fans won't find much to cheer about with this bland tale. Also the character's lines harp on the same points over and over again. For example, towards the end the game the word ""heart"" appears so much in the dialogue that you would think you are reading Cardiology Weekly. The story awkwardly stumbles along never quite gaining its footing. Presentation is also off key. Annoying voice-overs have Ryudo sounding more like a surfer dude than a sword-wielding hero. The in game movies are also sub-par for Dreamcast's capabilities.
Linear Game Play: This game is extremely linear. This meaning that you always know exactly where to go and what you have to do. Besides one or two ""Special Areas"" when you advance in the story you don't even have the option of going anywhere but forward. For people who object to RPGs by saying things like, ""You spend hours fighting pointless battles searching for your next task"" this is the game for you. Also, for a beginner RPG player this type of set-up puts frustration at a minimum. However, if you are into totally non-linear RPG's like Wizardry, for example, this game will be Boring with a capital B.
Battle Sequence: The battle sequence is the best part of this game. It is a semi-real time/turn based mode of battle. This makes fighting flow more evenly. Despite the times where my characters would attack an enemy out of view, I liked it immensely. It is an original action oriented way to structure the battle sequence. By strategizing your turns and types of moves you can limit certain enemy attacks. Also, you have the ability to make quick decisions to guard from an oncoming attack or evade before the enemy makes it to your side of the screen.
Challenge: The game is real easy. Probably too easy. There are many spells, special moves, and skills to learn. While all these enhance the game and add variety, after about 1/4 way through it is pretty hard to be hit much, forget about being killed. Moreover, at a save point you can automatically recover your entire HP/MP etc. Any enemy near a save point is toast because you can throw everything you have at them and after the battle fully recover. (at no cost to you).  Also, since you can see your enemies (no random fight generator) before battle you can almost always sneak up behind them and get the first attack. After very little practice learning the ins and outs of the battle sequence you can usually kill off most non-boss enemies without them getting a hit off. Again, good for the beginner and sort of pointless monotony for the experienced gamer.
By far the worst part of the game was the story. If you can ignore that you have about 20-30 hours of fun, if not challenging, game play. I would recommend it to beginner RPGers and experienced RPGers that just can't get enough games under their belts.",Good Beginner Role Playing Game

B00BGA9YZK,3.0,"Great graphics.  Decent gameplay.  Campaign is unimaginative, repetitive.",Three Stars
B0023RTCVQ,3.0,"This game is heavy on the side of finding hidden objects. Too much for my taste, so I only played the trial and decided against buying it.

That said, it has a few neat little features such as showing the shape of the hidden object in a jar when clicking on the respective word in the list. That made it easier to find an object if one got stuck. Also, the number of hints largely corresponds with the number of ravens the player can find in a scene - finding more ravens means having more hints available. And when too many incorrect objects are clicked on, the hint raven disappears for a while, i. e. no hints are available during that time, and a hissing one-eyed cat appears in its place for a period of time. Cute, but not that interesting after a while.

There are also a few ""hidden"" hidden objects in every scene - to uncover these, other previously found objects must be used. This is not too hard though because the cursor changes/lights up when it moves over an area where such a hidden object is ""buried"" and pop-up help guides the player.

During the entire 30 minute of the trial there was only one mini game to be played, and it was way too easy. So easy in fact that it almost cannot be called a mini game because absolutely no thinking was involved. I frequently used hints to find objects. Not because I couldn't have found them but I got bored with the repetitiveness and wanted to proceed in order to maybe get to an interesting mini game, but no such luck.

To be perfectly honest, I was relieved when the trial ended. This was just not for me, I would maybe give it to an older child, or a young teenager at the most, but in my opinion it is not engaging enough a game for adults.",A bit boring

B002CZ3SLO,3.0,"The storyline is really good, complex, and intelligent for the most part.  This is *very easily* the best thing about Shattered Memories.

The sexual content is definitely quite high, but I understand those short, simple questions you answer in the beginning of the game is entirely the reason for this. Just be careful- when you select the question that enables lots of sexual content, you most certainly will GET a ton of that!

You will quickly discover a LOT of cussing (and other surprising choices of words being used by all the characters).  I'm not talking about mild cussing either.  It's at a ridiculously inappropriate high level.  This is the main thing that separates this game from the original Silent Hill.  I dislike the negative lauguage rather strongly because it makes the game feel like a sad attempt to draw in gamers with the wrong kind of shock value.

Lisa looks about the same as I'd expect.  She's a really good character as well.

Cybil most certainly does NOT look the way I've always envisioned her. She's kind of ugly here, definitely more mature and older, and not nearly as attractive.

I can't remember that other female characters name, but she is *extremely* good looking.

Dahlia is, without spoiling anything... a major surprise just in the way she looks!!  Who would've known, haha.

The freezing elements are interesting, but maybe a bit repetitive as well.

The environments didn't actually freeze in the original Silent Hill- instead they turned much darker, creepier, and satanic.  I realize this is a reimagining and not necessarily a remake, but even keeping THAT in mind, freezing isn't *nearly* as terrifying to me as unexplainable blood markings and complete darkness (which is what the original Silent Hill mastered perfectly).

I like when Harry runs away from the enemies. I didn't realize the enemies would be THAT persistent in their chase and constantly be on Harry's behind *nonstop*. This definitely increases the fear by quite a lot.  In fact, hesitating for only a moment will probably guarantee taking a hit.

Of course, the fact there's really no way to defend yourself (with a gun) against said enemies (so the only thing you can do is shake free and continue running) is a bit of a letdown.

What in the HECK is up with that cell phone? Talk about a serious way to suck away any kind of fear the game tried to have in a HURRY! I didn't like that idea, I'm afraid. No more cell phones in future Silent Hill games!  Including cell phones makes the game feel too much like modern times and less like a confusing, unexplainable nightmare.  Simply put- cell phones don't belong in survival horror games.

""I LOVE MY DADDY!"" is a line that's going to haunt me forever.

Some people will complain the game is too short, but for me, it was just right.  I grew up in a time when it only took two or three hours to complete a game from start to finish, so I definitely welcome the length of this game.

Anyway, Shattered Memories is most certainly NOT as frightening as the original Playstation Silent Hill.  I don't care how much better the graphics look in comparison- the fact remains the atmosphere is almost completely missing from Shattered Memories.  Just play the original instead.",not as good as the original Playstation Silent Hill

B000692N0K,3.0,"This is an alright game but several things about it disturbed me. The first was the choice of language, it wasn't filthy but I felt it was inappropriate. I also thought it has too heavy of a story line to be a family friendly game. Too much war, too much violence. This should be called Heritage of Kings, The Battles, not the settlers as there is not much settling done due to much war. I think it also has too much of a strange fantasy to it, given that the main heroes can be killed off and if you have nearby friendly units, they jump right back to life, ready to fight again. It doesn't work for regular soldiers.  It wasn't what I thought it would be. The graphics and pictures are nice. I'm glad that the animals in the game are not harmed.",Too Heavy of a Storyline
B00452VG02,3.0,"There are a lot of people who bought this game simply because it had dedicated servers and quite frankly that doesn't make up for what a mediocre game this really is. For a start, like most games the singleplayer is short, but there is nothing new in it. It steals things from other games, especially Modern Warefare 2 and tries to poke fun at it. I'm not a CoD fanboy I swear, the CoD series have some of the most awful storylines in any games (except Cod 1 & 2, simply because they were based on real battles), but to copy things from a bad game, what does that say about Bad Company? The only thing that would make me enjoy the singleplayer would be a co op mode, but unfortunately no such mode exists.

Furthermore, there won't be a MOD that allows it either because, in their infinite wisdom, DICE decided to not release an SDK, so there won't be any chance of community created content. That's a real shame, because that's what made the original Battlefield 1942 last so long. It was the spawn for games like Battlefield 2, thanks to the Desert Combat MOD. There were also some great maps and MODS that extended the game even further, but no such thing exists with Bad Company 2. This game will barely last a year for FPS fans and the only reason people keep playing it is because either, they can't afford a new game or they are just fans of the series.

The game has nothing to keep any other gamer interested. The weapons feel like crap and sound awful. They don't have enough recoil and are incredible weak. I unlocked the last sniper rifle, added the perk that gives you extra damage and still, a shot to the chest in non-hardcore mode isn't enough to kill someone. It's pathetic.

The multiplayer maps are quite big and vehicles are a pleasure to use. Unfortunately it lacks variety in the vehicle department. If they had worked on this more, it could have been a game changer. Even the Desert Combat MOD and Battlefield 2 had more vehicles to play with.

As with every other DICE game, the spawn system is broken. Spawn camping is a huge problem on every map and gametype and it can get incredibly frustrating. Imagine not being able to do anything, because each time you spawn, there a tank in your base blowing you and your team mates up.

For the most part, the graphics are good, except for the fog. The levels are too bright and the fog and dust are more annoying than anything. There are times where you are completely blinded because of it and it's quite annoying.

The game has a leveling system like most FPS games these days. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as polished as Modern Warfare 2's system. I think there are about 50 levels to go through. I was about a level 20 something when I had unlocked ALL the items and weapons in the game. I honestly didn't see any point in playing the game after this point.

Since weapons and shooting aren't the strong points of this first person ""shooter"", the game emphasizes a lot of team work. Running around like a fool, like a CoD player will get you killed. You need the help of your team mates to give you health, ammo and repair vehicles if you want to succeed in a multiplayer game. In fact, the friends that I play with game with, that actually like it, aren't normally good at shooters. It seems that driving the vehicles, dropping health and ammo packs seem to be their strongest ability and is the best way to earn points.

Overall, unless you are a fan of the series you may as well skip over this one. Actually it's not even as good as any of the previous Battlefield games. I'd save your money for something else. 4/10.","It's Okay, but not that fun"

B00170825C,3.0,There are reviews here that have mixed feeling about it. But here is my two cents: 1 cent-not splinter cell or metal gear! This game has vampires looking to kill you and eat you. That is what makes it hard to get around. 2 cent-vampires looking to kill and eat you with no where to go if you are seen is what makes this game hard. And there is my two cents. This game was interesting in what was listed above and I was glad that someone took the time to do something like this but I really wished that they had the fun factor in mind when creating this. Like I said before these are vampires and they have a heighten sense of reality but to make it to the point that you can't even survive long enough to get a feel for it will turn a lot of players off. IF you think this is just your average gun and run shooter which is what got me then you are in for a HUGE surprise. IF think that the tactics in Splinter cell and metal gear will get you by then you are in for an even bigger disappointment. I can't say enough that this game just plain out will have you wanting to just fling it against the wall cause its so hard and not fun at all when you think about other stealth games out there. If you feel that your skills in stealth are that good then here is a challenge for you and personally I didn't even finish it cause of the fact is was jsut frustrating trying to survive long enough to figure out how to get by one or two vampires. And if you are not on the roof in snipeing them off before moving you are dead. And if you shoot one and forget the other then come out of your hiding you are got cause they are moving to the sound of your shot. That is just one example of how frustrating it was. Get this if you think you got game but personally this will just piss you off the way it did me.,Not for everyone.
B00KVRNIQU,3.0,"There is nothing really new from this game. The graphics are decent but not jaw-dropping. The 30 frame per second is a letdown since the last one was 60 FPS on the Ps4.
The story feels too clich. It really is just an average game. It feels too similar to the last campaign. The immortal thing is over-played. The story is predictable at every turn.
The gameplay is super smooth. It combines elements of The Last of Us, Assassin's Creed, and the previous Tomb Raider. At times, you may feel like you're Spider-Man, swinging around and climbing the environment.
The soundtrack isn't very prominent. It feels like the composer was going for a minimal use of music.
I'd say to wait until the game is around $30. I got it on sale with the season pass so it was $60 for the Deluxe Edition and it still doesn't feel worth the price. I hope my review was informative.",Rise of the Tomb Raider falls short of expectations and hype.
B00F0DCH9Y,3.0,"I am used to slim island-style keyboards, but decided to try this keyboard anyway.  Key presses are firm and not  loud, as it is a membrane dome keyboard.  I was mostly surprised by its appearance.  The photos don't do it justice.  It is very attractive in person.

My biggest gripe is that the key lighting is uneven on some keys.  For example, the ""tab"" key isn't fully back lit on my model.  The word ""Tab"" is only partially lit by the back lighting.  It s a trivial issue, but an issue nonetheless.

I am happy too say the media controls work just fine with my PC, and it is nice to have them built-in on the keyboard.",Mostly Happy
B0001XMA6I,3.0,"Not caring at all about graphics, this game is very good, and puts a Star Wars label on the new brand of Checkpoint-nabbing shooter war games like Battlefield 1942, Vietnam, etc.  Except there is only one basic weapon and pistol and secondary... no dropping weapons and picking up new ones.

The game is fun and addicting but gets boring.  The campaigns aren't any different from the actual game at all.  A big problem is that the maps are too small for aircraft to enjoy the joy of flight.  To be effective with shooting, you have to constantly be braking just to hit more things on the ground.

All in all, fun, but quickly boring.  Not really worth buying now, wait till it's 10$ or borrow from a friend",Fun..... just fun
B000NGRIDI,3.0,"When you first start up Oblivion after installing Shivering Isles you get a message that tells you that a strange portal has opened up somewhere. Once you find the portal and enter it you meet a man that fills you in on whats going on and then he lets you in the door to the island. The first thing you notice when you enter the realm is that it's breath takingly beautiful. There is a lush landscape of trees,brush,mushrooms,waterfalls and large hills that seem to go on forever. Even though this game is an expansion pack it is huge in its own right. It can take you a while to travel across the isles and get to Sheogoraths palace. The first thing you notice when you start talking to the people of the Isles is the fact that they are all friggen nuts! Pretty much all the npc's in this game talk to you in riddles and don't make a whole lot of sense. The most crazy of all the people in the Isles is Sheogorath himself,he is the mad God that runs the Isles and he has a bit of a problem(aside from being insane).Creatures have snuck into Sheogoraths realm and he needs your help to get rid of them. Sheogorath is a crack up,he will keep you laughing with his own demented brand of logic. The humor in this expansion pack is dark but not so dark that it offends. The Shivering Isles is a nice add on to Oblivion and is filled with tons of little side quests that will keep you playing for hours on end. If you have done almost everything there is to do in the main Elder scrolls game then you should pick this pack up.",A pretty good add on to Oblivion.

At this point, Dynasty Warriors 3 is out....there is really no need to even play this one.  DW3 is far better with improved gameplay and even multiplayer mode.  Don't waste even a rental fee on this, if you really want to see DW2 play....just get DW3, there's not much difference.  It's not that it isn't fun or cool...it's just that DW3 is the same thing packed with more fun.  The problem I have with this one is, it takes over an hour to beat one level....and there really isn't any save points.  That can be aggravating if you don't have a full hour to waste.

B00005Q8LR,3.0,"When I got my Gamecube at [local store] the day it was released last November, waiting in line for 4 hours, beating the rush at [local store] later on that day to get my already reserved copy of Luigi's Mansion, and scrambling around to find an available Memory Pack, I knew it would all be worth it. I just didn't expect exactly how disappointed I'd be with Luigi's Mansion.
Well, it's not as bad as I just made it sound. The cons will be listed first. The game has no graphical prowess, the music is... repetetive, the gameplay is overly simplistic, and the game is over way too soon... a little TOO shabby for Gamecube's first game. But, I wasn't beating myself over the head for buying it, either.
The pros are fewer, but just let me get through them. While I mentioned that the music was repetetive, Nintendo find's ways to add flair to one song that's played basically the entire game. So it's not like you're listening to the same song over and over, sometimes Luigi will be whistling it, sometimes a harp will be playing it, other times a low bass will be playing it... when your health is low the music will play much slower. So it's not all that bad. While the gameplay is overall simplistic, it is challenging at times, from finding all 50 boos to solving puzzles that can be a little mind boggling at times. The framerate is overall constant, no slowdown whatsoever, the graphics are smooth if simplistic, and there's a Pikmin movie! (Woohoo!...)
Luigi's Mansion is entertaining, for about 3 days. Once it's over, it's basically over, the ""hidden"" mansion doesn't add much either. If you're a hardcore Mario/Luigi fan, like myself, maybe you should invest in this. If not, maybe a rental would be good. And if you're looking for the next good Mario/Luigi platformer, wait for Super Mario Sunshine.",Innovation...?

B0149QBXJC,3.0,"Nice keyboard and feel overall. Not mechanical. I liked everything about it but I noticed that my SHIFT key will not capitalize one letter out of a group of letters when held down fairly often. Not sure if the SHIFT key is just touchy and I'm releasing slightly when holding it down for more than one letter typed or what but I've never experienced this problem on another keyboard. It's only been maybe a year but the CTRL key is now sticky. I managed to get it to work better for now but it'll have the problem again at some point.

I expect these issues eventually but not within a year of ownership. Maybe I got a rare keyboard with some glitches because otherwise I love this keyboard. I paid around $55 for mine and Amazon shows it for $70 at the moment so maybe see if you can get it cheaper or go get the K50 because it's actually a bit cheaper than the K30 at the moment and is more feature-rich.",Great keyboard

It is never going to stop since we keep giving them our money and it is going to keep getting worse and worse unless we actually do something about it, like buying the game used so the company doesn't get our money (which is what I did) or buying a different game, then I guaranteed that they won't ever do it again.",Shame on you EA

B00946FSJ4,3.0,"The combat and class (barbie dress up system) really carry this game.  Sadly, the weak points of the 13 series are still present:  poor dialogue/localization and a nebulous story with unexplained references to the universe's lore.",Good combat and class system

The flaw in the design is the microphone.

B00LCHZRIK,3.0,"This a a Zelda game missing most of what makes an incredible Zelda game. I would put this game on par with Skyward Sword that had the exact opposite problem of this game. Let me say that this is a fun game, but it is not even close to being perfect. Ocarina of time is a perfect game. Ocarina had exploration, a great immersive coherent story, big region unique dungeons with a different memorable boss fight at the end of each one, different enemies in each region, and great side quests. Breath of the Wild has exploration and that's about it.

There are no dungeons just four divine beasts that are all the same thing and take about 15 minutes to go through and then repeat the same easy boss fight with a different element for each one. The enemies are all the same just different colors and elements to make them more difficult in some areas. The actual story could be completed in about 4 to 6 hours if you just focus on it. All you do is beat the divine beasts, find cutscene locations, and beat ganon. I found myself not caring about the weak story in this one. The majority of your time will be spent exploring, finding 900 korok seeds, or finding and beating the 120 shrines. The shrines are supposed to make up for no dungeons, but they are all the same theme with one to three room puzzles or a one same enemy combat trial. The Hylian villages and towns are cool that you find, but the villages like the Rito village in particular just feels small, lazy, and unimaginative.

The few things I did like about this game are that I enjoyed the ability to go anywhere I want and I am only limited by my stamina. I enjoyed the ability to tackle any fight and situation however i could imagine. Finding secrets scattered about with some pretty good side quests or challenges like and island were you are stripped of all equipment and forced to use everything at your disposal where great. The different armors were amazing. Since weapons are always breaking there are tons of different cool looking weapons to use and we finally have elemental rods in a 3D console Zelda.

Overall I enjoyed my 30 hours I spent playing this game, but at the same time I was disappointed at how little true Zelda gameplay there actually was. After a couple hours the game becomes repetitive and lacking in variety. I can't see myself ever coming back to play this game unlike the others in the series which I have played through and beat multiple times. I don't understand these supposed Zelda fans calling this the best in the series and a perfect game. If you have never played an open world game in your life then maybe, but games like Witcher 3 are how you make a perfect open world game. Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever.","Fun, but worst in the series."
B0000CDZBC,3.0,"I went ahead and bought this game based on the generally positive reviews it's received here.  After playing it however, I'm baffled and a little suspicious - as I am with anything Sony puts it's name on these days.  Ok, yeah, granted this game is old but, it does prove that Sony is very successful in it's continued quest to run the EQ franchise into the ground.

For EQ fans, let me just state that the lore is completely butchered in this game.  For example, they put Kelethin in Lesser Faydark and also, the Pit of Ill Omen is stated as being ""right off the coast of Faydwer"", when it should be within Kunark. While most likely this is Snowblind's fault, it's hard for me to even imagine that Snowblind worked on this game, considering Dark Alliance 1 and 2 are top notch games with solid production values (RIP Black Isle).

Ok, on with it...

Starting out in Champions of Norrath you're immediately burdened by encumbrance issues.  To add insult to injury, mobs drop a lot of loot.  Granted, most of it is vendor trash, but you can't vendor what you can't carry - an immediate axe in the dynamic of a Diablo style game.  The Ranger also requires arrows, which are 20 to a quiver @ 3 lbs ... starting out you can't carry enough arrows to be an effective archer.  Normally in an RPG I support the realism of having limited arrows, but really, this is not that kind of game.  Which leads me to wonder if they didn't simply take the more frustrating aspects of classic RPGs and pasted them into an action-RPG template.

Now let's move on to one of the most glaring flaws of this game that I'm a tad shocked is rarely mentioned.  The voice is completely out of synch.  It lags behind horribly!  If my character states, ""I'm out of mana"", you won't hear him say it until about 2-3 seconds after the OOM event.  The voice lag is also a problem with every cut scene.  I would actually finish reading the dialogue before the voice-over actually kicked in!  Pretty bad.

On top of all this, the game fails to deliver the EQ feel at all.  Incredibly, none of the memorable melodies from EQ made it into this game, which would have been an easy way to capitalize on a sense of familiarity.

Really, this game to me, by look and feel, felt like a Sci-fi game.  Design wise it has more of a Star Trek / outlandish feel rather than a medieval-fantasy feel.  Jungles, and deserts, gnomish contraptions, etc.  It's like Sci-fi but for some reason and just because - with medieval weaponry.  They could just as easily threw in light sabers with little interruption.  Granted, in hind sight, EQ wasn't all that medieval either so, keep that in mind if you're like me and went with this game based on suggestions for classic medieval style action-RPGs - like the Dark Alliance series.

Anyway it's not a horrible game, but it's definitely a game I would only play if I had nothing else.  I guess for those with a multi-tap, there's added justification, but for me that would be annoyance x 4.",Champions of Snorrath

This game however is an FPS, maybe more of a successor to Turok. It has some of the trademark bad dialogue and voice attributable another Capcom franchise: Resident Evil. The plot is pretty much nonsense involving the Bermuda triangle and time travel, but not told in any way that enhances the gameplay experience. The dinos and jungle backgrounds are fairly well done and there's some selection of weapons: a 1911 .45 pistol, a fully-auto Glock 9mm, a 30-06 BAR, a 44 magnum, a shotgun, a musket, and an assault rifle. The only problem is that each weapon has essentially the same effects on the dinos, so the bullets from the 9mm act the same as those from the magnum. That took away from the experience for me.

B000PE0HCM,3.0,"While I do understand that the DS games can't be as grand as the wii versions & that the series is aimed predominantly at an audience younger than I, this game was just disappointing. I've played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MySims-Kingdom/dp/B0019R4VCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MySims Kingdom</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MySims-Agents/dp/B00282WKEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MySims Agents</a>&nbsp;for the wii & liked both of them. There's just something about the Sims franchise that makes these games addicting. While a spark of that exists in this game, it really was more of a chore & a disappointment than anything else.

While the wii version (which I also have & plan to play) is supposed to have you forming your own city, the main gist of the DS version is that you have to help give a boost to a resort town that's seen better days. As you play & progress, you'll unlock more shops, more sports & more people will visit your town.

This might seem interesting at first until you realize exactly how much repetition is required to really get the most out of everything. You can get through the game without stopping for the smaller bits like talking to all of your city's guests. The mini-games are interesting, but eventually those just get a little too dull to keep playing. If there was less dialogue in the game I'd just assume that it is because the game designers want to make the game easier for younger audiences, but younger gamers will get frustrated at the amount of reading & the older readers will be frustrated at how slow the game is. This was just a lackluster entry into the Sims franchise- this could have been done a LOT better than it was.

This is a definite rental game. I don't recommend buying it unless you plan on passing it along to someone else or just to complete your MySims collection. I purchased this used at my local GameStop & I really feel that my money would have been better spent on something else. This was fun enough for about a week, but not really beyond that.","Nice enough graphics, but pretty boring"
B00ABTAZV4,3.0,ok,Three Stars
B000U88UVS,3.0,"I have played Sim City and The Sims and liked the idea of building a city based on community values. But this is more of a pretty construction set than a challenging game. First there is no depth to that promised value system. You can put in lots of temples and churches, Orwellian interrogation sites or get heavy into high rises, but you the game play does not differ significantly from one value system to the next. Buildings give or take away points and you are forced to do silly things like insert a ridiculous number of fountains or Real estate offices in order to get enough Prosperity points to build seemingly unrelated items like golf courses, restuarants and hair salons. Adding three fountains to build a hair salon isn't very challenging.

I was hoping that you could stipulate a series of values and let them determine how the people reacted, rather than just building pretty cities. As mentioned in another review, as long as the power is on, you can build a huge city with no water treatment plant, sewerage system or garbage collection. The idea behind the game is a good one but I think combining that idea with the Sim City format was not. The game concept would work much better as an interactive adventure where you play a character and interact directly with citizens to learn how to navigate in their society.

The game ran pretty well on my system but the auto saves were annoying as they occur often and completely halt game play while the program writes to disk. I also found the road tool to be problematic as it seldom correctly reads a simple turn, creating instead a small maze of roadways.

I bought the game yesterday, played it for about 4 hours and the result of that is a medium sized city, lots of medals that don't mean much and a crew of happy citizens. I used the tutorial to start and then built the majority on my own using the ""normal"" level of difficulty. Since I don't have gigs to burn on my hard drive, I will probably take this game off by tomorrow and end up passing it on to a family member. If you are new to gaming and want to have some fun I highly recommend it as it is much easier to do well in this game than either Sims or Sim City. You can even use it to teach your young kids about living ""green,"" showing them firsthand the effects of pollution and overcrowding.

If you are a serious gamer not into teaching children, you will likely get bored very quickly and should probably skip this one.",A Hybrid with little depth of play but fun for new gamers

There are no special / finnishing manuvers either. The game is nothing like the present wrestling games, such as the fact that there is only one arena and present games have seven or more arenas. There is however several types of matches, such as single, tag team, and Survivor Series matches.",The original SNES wrestling game.

B000V728P2,3.0,"Her Interactive has redeemed itself with this game. On the positive side, I enjoyed Bess' pluck, determination, and ingenuity -- and the fact that she had the opportunity to infilitrate a secret society (like Skull & Bones.) The game was well structured and interesting....and the graphics were superb. This game also drew from of the clever affects of previous games -- including overhearing private conversations from hidden passages/behind walls and being able to acquire info by spying on others from peep holes (think Blackmoor and Message in Haunted Mansion).

However, I found many of the puzzles in this game rather tedious (especially the marbles and wasps) which relied more on hand-eye coordination and mouse functionality than wit. I would have also appeciated more character development/interaction...and the plot, while interesting and well structured, still fell a bit flat. Would have been nice to have seen more of New Orleans as well.

It is a vast improvement to recent games. If you generally like Nancy Drew games, you will like this one too.  Good, but not great.","Improved, but Not a Home Run"
B000FG65F8,3.0,"In the 1980s, when human minds are less sophisticated, many video game concepts were centred on the theme of ""rescuing the princess, saving the world"". Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins utilizes the same concept, and it's hardly surprisingly - it's a modern take on the original Ghost `n Goblins from 1986. In this 21st century rendition of this classic game, Knight Arthur returns (with his armor and, ahem, underwear) to save Princess Prin from the undead, again. To make the adventure more up-to-date, however, Capcom have added several new features to it. These include the introduction of 3D graphics, and new in-game tools and techniques that allow Arthur to defeat the enemies that stand in his way.

Apart from his usual repertoire of skills, Arthur has a number of new moves up his sleeves. One of them is the ability to dash, executed when you double tap left or right quickly. This is helpful when you need to clear an area fast, but it usually ends up badly due to the large number of enemies that appear on screen. Arthur also has the aptitude to grab, which makes platforming a little easier, since he can now hang on the edge of a platform without falling to his death after a missed jump. Shields are also introduced into the gameplay, which allow Arthur to repel attacks by simply pressing the down button on the D-Pad.

Despite the new abilities, however, Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins remains insanely challenging even when played on the easiest of its three difficulty levels. To put it simply, the game is hard. Enemies will attack you in quick succession. They will also re-spawn regularly, leaving you with hardly any room to breathe. Even the platforming is tricky, and it regularly requires you to take a leap of faith, which tends to result in a fall to death. Don't be surprised if you find yourself doing a level over and over again until you get it right. This isn't necessary a bad thing, but it may discourage the less patient gamers.

To make life a little better, the game throws in some much needed aid. During the game, you'll find treasure chests, which usually house weapons and magical skills. As expected, different weapons produce different effects and range. For example, the lance (a default weapon) attacks reasonably quickly, but flies only in a straight line. The Boomerang Scythe (a new addition, by the way), on the other hand, flies a little slower, but has the ability to return to Arthur, thus clearing enemies that are closing in. Magical skills are more sophisticated to use, as they require Arthur to be equipped with armor, as well as to have enough MP. They're, however, much more powerful in dealing with the undead. The Time Magic, for example, slows time for everyone except Arthur. The Invincible Magic wraps a force field around Arthur, rendering any enemy's attacks on him useless for a limited period. These abilities only reduce the difficulty level slightly though, since you won't be getting powered-up all the time. You'll still have to be on your toes regularly to deal with the game's deliberately high demands.

The high level of difficultly wouldn't be the only challenge you'd face when playing Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins. Unlike many other games, the game actually forces you to be a completist. Throughout the game, you may encounter some hard-to-find golden rings. You may think that the collection of these rings is an optional side quest (think the Mario Bros.'s gold coins) that won't impact the grand scheme of things. Well, you couldn't be more wrong. The locations of these rings are usually fairly well hidden, and you'd probably not notice them when you're just running for your life in most of the levels. You can run for all you want though, but when you reach the end of 5th level, you'll find that you won't be able to proceed to the game's final level without a prerequisite number of golden rings. This is where the warp portals come in - they'll allow you to return to earlier levels to relive the nightmare. This time, however, the nightmare will be scarier, because apart from running for your life, you'll have to hunt for those damn rings as well. But wait, it's not over yet. Collecting a different required number of rings will also unlock different endings (three in all) for the game. Again, this could be a welcomed challenge for the more daring, but an absolute whammy for the uninitiated.

Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins is essentially still a 2D platformer, but the 3D elements add depth to the already nice graphics. They may look less polished when compared to the more flashy presentations on other PSP games, but the unique art style and level of details still look great nonetheless, even by today's standards. The soundtrack, though remixed, also brings back some fond (and some not so fond) memories of myself huffing and puffing through a level of Makaimura (the Japanese version of the original Ghosts n' Goblins) back in those days. The sound effects, however, are a little weak, and could do with a little more variety. Not that I really mind though, because the music is good enough to keep me contented. The game also comes with in an old-school D-pad (attachable to the PSP's analog button) for those who wants to relive the experience of playing the game on the NES controller. This is a really nice touch that adds some nostalgic value to the overall package.

In conclusion, Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins may or may not be your cup of tea, depending on whether you're in for a challenge. Some aspects of it are frustrating, and it's certainly not an easy one to complete. But in an era when games are perhaps giving too much leeway to the gamer, it's a game like this that really dishes out a nice challenge to those who're in need of one. Ultimate Ghosts `n Goblins is a testament of how solid, challenging gameplay is all about, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's yearning for a good title on the PSP.","Jump Arthur, Jump."

I loved the soccer on the 360 one, but this one is kind of crappy. You basicly kick the ball around a bunch of stationary mannequins.  I'm incredibly disappointed in Kinect games in general with Xbox one. I thought these games would get a little more intuitive and active, but they seem to be toning it down. I think they toned down kinect games to cater to the people who were too uncoordinated to play the first vision. It's really sad, it was such a great idea, and there was so much potential. Now it's ruined, because most people are too spastic to play these games and rather then take the time to learn, they complain and hate on the technology.

The controls are mostly spot on and have enough variety to make combat fun.  Being able to use the shield is a great, and necessary, addition to the game and is done very well.  You can use it to block gun fire and even send the bullets back at the attacker.  You can target and throw it at multiple enemies at once and Captain America actually moves like Captain America.

Compared to previous COD titles, this is a drop off with action and combat realism. Seems like the type of game that is made when a developer knows there is a blind fan base and only wants to make money. I am not going to sit here telling you not to buy the game. Here is what I will say: If you have money to throw away and want to buy an extra shooter title because there is not much out at this time, buy it and it should give you a fix. If your money is hard earned, don't waste your time because you WILL be disappointed with the cookie cutter feel, lack of innovation, and totally uninspired package.

Special Forces has a ability to a 3 second wallhack-meaning I press his special
ability I can see where there at in Multi-Player/Pointman has only 30 rounds od Special
hardpoint ammo/EOD has his thing he pull down his visor on his helmet and more protection.

What this game could of done is more customization with weapons-I like to mix it up have some frags

B00HHUSOLI,4.0,"I liked these skins. They fit quite nicely and are comfortable in the hand.  I have the foamy lizard studded grips for a different skin, and think I may prefer how these feel better, especially for the price.  I got 4 skins for less than the price of the studded skin. The fact that they glow is a fun added bonus.  Though only the white one glows pretty well.  The rest glow, but are muted.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I have a docking station for my controllers that requires a piece to be plugged into the mini USB port at all times. This skin infringes on the ability to use the docking station.  It was easily remedied by cutting out around the plug, but I didn't have to do that with my foamy lizard skin.  The skin is a little thinner than the foamy lizard one as well. So there is a little less protection, but the buttons protrude better.  With the foamy lizard skin the buttons are pretty much flush with the skin. That was annoying at first, but you get used to it.

B000Y3RF6K,4.0,"This is a very fun DS action-type game.  If you have any history playing old video games (which a lot of DS players don't have) this game will remind you a little mix of Defender, Xevious and Raiden.

B000TSX3UC,4.0,"Most people complain how this guitar is cheap feeling or doesn't have the build, feel, or ease of use as the Rock Band 2 and up guitar models. This may be true, but despite these slight issues, the guitar works great for what you pay. The main thing about the controller is the feel and it feels more sturdy than a guitar hero controller, and the buttons aren't awkwardly placed. Sure if you are a real guitar player it takes getting used to the plastic neck feel but overall it has a good feel and good length with an adjustable strap. The buttons also are easy to press and don't get stuck nor are too hard to press down. Of course the strumming bar also feels pretty natural although I wish it was a little more sensitive and natural feeling. Whammy bar is perfectly placed so you can access it while strumming and the effect knob is also a decent feature, although you won't really want to be bothered touching this once the song starts playing. As for overdrive, it takes getting used to but it does work once you figure it out. You need to tilt the guitar vertically while your meter is half or more full. This is a lot easier than it sounds but can take getting used to and is somewhat impractical for hard or up difficulties, but still manageable if you are able to finger and strum while you cock your guitar. Another way that is highly unrecommended unless you are in the middle of a 5 or more second break is hit the select button and while this way is easier and more guaranteed than cocking is also require you to take your strumming hand away from the bar. The guitar is pretty plain looking, even compared to guitar hero guitars and the neck is just one color. Overall though it is cheap and can be found for around $20 new while it is almost impossible to find Rock Band 2 and up guitars under $40. So you are sacrificing half the price for less convenient overdrive and more plain look, but other than this, it does its job and feels how a guitar should feel. If you can afford the Rock Band 2 guitar get that, but if guitar isn't your main instrument or you don't care about slightly inconvenient overdrive, go for this.",Not the best guitar but worth the price

B0001CJCE2,4.0,"This game was pretty fun, the graphics were just beautiful. When I first got the game, it was rather difficult to beat since I was playing the original Spyro games for Playstation for so long. But than I eventually got use to it, grew to like it more and more. The game play is excellent! Spyro is re-mixed in this nice new world where everything seems connected and its like your traveling through a great big maze of colorful, cheerful, and foreboding dark worlds. You have plenty of new task to complete as well as some old ones that are vaguely familiar.
Old Task:
1. Collecting gems.
2. Destroying enemies for gems.
3. Flaming weaved baskets and ramming steeled/iron chest.
4. Egg Thieves, catch the thief of course, to collect an egg. Although the thieves look a LOT different now and there are ten eggs to a set, that if you collect them all, allows you to receive or get to do something special.
5. Ramming through cracked walls or blowing through blocked off entrance ways with a cannon.
6. Spark Shooter, which is different but still familiar, not as hard as the original shooter from Spyro: Year of the Dragon for Playstation.
New Task:
1. Completing St. Byrd flying levels.
2. Hunter Level, where you play as Hunter using a bow to collect an light gem and egg.
4. Blink, where you play as a mole to collect 5/10 Dark Gems.
5. And other random characters that need your help throughout the game.
6. Collecting Light Gems.
7. Collecting Dark Gems.
Old Moves:
1. Flame.
2. Jump.
3. Walk.
4. Running (although its more of a ""bucking,"" gallop now).
6. Head bash.
New Moves:
1. Double Jump.
2. Electric Breathe.
3. Water Breathe.
4. Ice Breathe.
You can also buy different missiles or collect them about the world to beat enemies that might be out of reach. There are also a number of items you now have to buy. Instead of collecting gems to collect them all, you now have to collect them to buy things. Money Bags has changed a LOT! He is now more annoying than ever, having you hand over your gems to buy items to get farther in the game in shops in the home world, he even has his little portals where you can buy them which cost twice as much in the mini worlds! There are Spark Keys you have to collect to open locked chest that ether give you a Light Gem or an Egg, there is also a nice new set of horns that you can buy that increase the damage and force your Head bash move does, there is a bottle of butterflies that you can buy too that allows you to have an extra set of full life incase you die and much more!
You can also play as difference characters in the game, besides the ones already listed above, like Flame or Ember. Of course, you have to collect all ten eggs of a set to play as one. When you do though, they still have the voice of Spyro, so it kind of takes away from being that new character.
The Worlds?
There are numerous worlds that you travel to and at least four homes worlds where you start from.
1. You first start at Dragon Village, where it is has two other worlds you can travel to, Crocovile Swamp and Dragonfly Falls. You also have to defeat Gnasty Gnorc again, who looks pretty pitiful and cheesy compared to him being the villain in Spyro the Dragon, the first game on Playstation.
2. The second place you travel to, after defeating Gnasty Gnorc and getting the electric breathe is Coastal Remains, which you also travel to its two connected worlds: Cloudy Domain and Sunken Ruins. The Boss of this entire new world is Ineptune, who reminds you vaguely of the villain from The Little Mermaid.
3. After defeating her you go to the home world of Frostbite Village, which also has Gloomy Glacier and Ice Citadel. After getting all the Dark Gem, you than get to face Red, well, kind of. And you travel to the last world...
4. Stormy Beach is the last home world and is one of my favorites. The two other mini worlds in this place is Molten Mount/Magma Falls and Dark Mine, but there is also Red's Laboratory where you can finally defeat Red once and for all!
Overall I give this game four stars. The reason behind this is, even though it's a nice game and fun to play, it can get very confusing and things seem all mused together, with barley any distinction between the worlds within the home worlds.",More Spyro fun!
B0000C6FKA,4.0,"Most games within the racing genre are generally very easy to divide into sub-genres; there's the straight simulation, the action-leaning cartoon / kart racer, and the arcade racer, which lands somewhere in between. Project Gotham Racing 2 is the textbook definition of an arcade racer. It's stuffed full of the physics, modeling, real world location selection and intense competition you'd expect to find in a simulation racer, which results in something of a sim-flavored credibility, but streamlines most of the meticulous, detail-oriented specifics that usually turn off casual gamers and anyone, really, without permanent oil stains on their fingers or a rice burner in the garage. This is a game that excels at delivering the sensation that you're really behind the wheel, with the force of several hundred horses behind your right foot, but also at keeping away from the monotony and mindless repetition that's usually associated with a race of more than one or two laps.

Separating it from straight sims, such as Sony's Gran Turismo titles, is PGR's heavy focus on the acquisition of ""Kudo Points."" The driving force behind each of the two previous chapters in the Project Gotham / Metropolis series, Kudos are gathered through a variety of methods, some common and everyday, others more difficult and unpredictable, and always center on the theme of ""driving stylishly."" In short, you're expected to drive an exciting race every single time you hit the track. While almost every other racer in the history of the industry concentrates exclusively on the clock and the ongoing pursuit of faster laps and more efficient driving, Gotham 2 places a much higher emphasis on showmanship and flashy tricks. You'll gain a flat sum of Kudos for passing an opponent's car or taking a turn properly, but more elaborate maneuvers, such as drifting wildly around a curve or catching some air, reward with higher sums depending on the duration of the trick and your willingness to go on longer and longer stretches without complete control of your vehicle. If you aren't leaving behind a patch of burnt rubber and a cloud of foul-smelling smoke, PGR wants you to think you've done something wrong.

The idea is to shake up the usual formula of ""drive three identical laps and don't let anybody pass you,"" and on the large, it works. Instead of enjoying a track the first few times you drive it, then giving in to brainless replication, you'll find yourself constantly challenged and interested in a course. Actually racing is a lot more fun when you can make the most of your big lead by firing off a few donuts at the finish line or allowing the back end of your car to slide well beyond the point of good reason while taking an easy turn. The key is finding a good middle ground between a dull, straightforward race and an excessively daring, mistake-filled hunt for bigger and better tricks, since most of your opponents' cars are merely looking to win the race and couldn't care less about looking good in doing so.

Actually racing in Gotham is largely very enjoyable, despite a few snags, and though it can make you almost blindingly filled with rage, there's just a certain something that keeps you coming back for more, looking to improve and show the game who's boss in the end. There's a vibe you'll get from controlling one of these cars that's difficult to put into words, something that's perhaps not immediately obvious when it's there but absolutely glaring when it's missing. It's something of a sense of reality, that feeling that you're actually moving as fast as the speedometer says you are, that your car really is as powerful as it claims. It's... well, it's really cool, for lack of a better phrase. When you accelerate in one of Gotham's more thrust-heavy high end machines, you'll feel something pressing down right in the center of your chest... that, and just a tiny bit of adrenaline.

As I hinted, however, the gameplay isn't always wine and roses. There are a few aspects that leave me scratching my head, for instance the decision for the player-controlled car to always, ALWAYS begin the race in last place, without any sort of a qualifying lap or anything. You're always fighting an uphill battle, as you must work your way around the painfully slow cars that start just in front of your position while the speedy pole-sitter gets a chance to create as much distance between himself and your car as possible.

One area in which Gotham 2 really makes its case as a front-running title is the amazing variety of its maps and race tracks. You'll find yourself globe trotting from Moscow to Barcelona to Sydney and back, driving on tracks that vary in length from excessively minute to inexplicably long. Seriously, one course allows the driver to finish four laps in under three minutes, while another demands fifteen minutes of dedication per lap! The environments are incredibly lush and detail heavy, and each course is allowed several different racing layouts, providing endless hours of replay value on courses that look similar at a glance, but are laid out completely differently.

In ""Kudos World Series"" mode, rather than giving players a course, a rundown of opposing cars and a quick ""good luck,"" Gotham shakes up the status quo by not only introducing a few new (and almost universally successful) game types, but by making them an integral part of the single player experience, to boot. As you'll progress through ""World Series"" mode, you'll work your way through a healthy mix of seven different spins on the traditional gameplay model. Each variation seems to emphasize one aspect of becoming a successful driver in the straightforward street races, which remain the bread and butter of individual play, and surprisingly enough, none come across as forced, unnecessary or aggravating.

The multiplayer aspect of the game is a nice addition, if occasionally underdeveloped, but should never be mistaken for the star of the show. The online multiplayer does allow for more than straightforward head-to-head matches, but could have done with a little more thought when all is said and done. The actual system of joining a race online is a tedious, boring affair. You'll find a room with slots available for more racers, find that a race is more than likely already in progress, and then find yourself relegated to observing the remainder of the race from a stale, overhead map with tiny colored squares to indicate the location of each car. There's no fly-by observation mode, or really any kind of visual flair in the slightest. If you have the misfortune of attempting to join an excessively lengthy race just after it's started, your options are either to stare vacantly at the screen for upwards of ten minutes or drop out of the room and look for another race. In short, the multiplayer mode is quite weak and borderline unfinished, which stands in sharp contrast to the polished, beautiful nature of the single player game it accompanies. Very disappointing, and something that brought my opinion of the game down a notch or two.

The amount of work that went into every visual aspect of this game is obvious from the very first moment you boot up. Everything from the menus to the surroundings to, obviously, the vehicles themselves is unspeakably gorgeous. It's a shame the HD output is limited to 480p, because I can't even imagine the kind of impact this would've had at 720p or 1080i. The little touches are what grabbed me the most: they didn't have to include that flock of birds, flying ignorantly over the roads, or that enormous, spindly ferris wheel off in the distance, but they did, and they take unprecedented steps toward furthering the illusion that you're actually there, in person, participating in these races. Nothing about this game's visuals seem forced, even areas that have provided nightmares in other games. The glares and reflections off your car's exterior, which could've very easily been tacky and overdone, seem just right. My sole complaint is that the dynamic lighting is sometimes too realistic, as it occasionally becomes difficult to see where you're going when racing among the long, dark shadows of a dusk-time race. PGR2 is just a gorgeous bit of digitized visual realization, something that set the bar way too high for any competition to even hope to match.

In summary... well, I'll say this in no uncertain terms; this game is a hell of a lot of fun. The controls are simple, easy to comprehend and staggeringly easy to pick up on. The courses, set in landmark cities throughout North America, Europe and Asia, are challenging and varied without completely throwing the player for a loop every time they load a new track. The incline of opposition is steep, progressing upwards from relatively simple-minded Sunday drivers to blood-hungry maniacs who know exactly what they want and precisely how to get it. Even the gameplay, which is largely relegated to simple ""race against the computer or race against your friends"" in other titles, gets a breath of life here, in the form of half a dozen different modes of play. It lacks the fine, fine details of tuning a racing auto to perfection, but seeing as how I'm not all that intrigued by that aspect of the business as it is, I didn't miss those options one bit. If the multiplayer mode had been just a little more well-developed, I'd be giving this one a nearly perfect rating, but as it is right now it's still far above average. This one is definitely worth adding to your collection if you have even the slightest interest in driving a car around a track at insane speeds, and remains one of the most visually stimulating experiences I've enjoyed in gaming.",The Best Racer on the Old Xbox
B000WEQL02,4.0,"The Good: The best tactical shooter too date, decent length, excellent multiplayer, lots of cussing, lots of customization options

The Bad: Poor graphics, feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel

For some reason ""expansion pack"" type ""sequels"" is what Ubisoft keeps pumping out for it's Tom Clancy games. I recently did a review of GRAW 2 and complained about this exact same issue. Nonetheless R6V2 is a great tactical shooter and there is more good going for it than bad. Everyone's played the first game so I'll leave out what you already know. Some great new features is the new sprint. While I didn't use this much it's great for running down long hallways to get to where you need too.

There are some new guns (I don't know what's new but I know there's new guns) and the multiplayer is as awesome as ever. Another new feature is the ""Terrorist Hunt"" mode in which you pick your level and hunt down all the terrorist either by yourself or cooperatively. The story is pretty good as well. You have to fight the Mexican terrorists from destroying and terrorizing Vegas while also hunting down a traitor among the Rainbows. The graphics are very disappointing. For using the Unreal 3 engine you think the graphics would blow you away but they are very weak. The game isn't much to look at, but you just play for the easy pick up and play tactical greatness. The game has a decent length (coming in at about 8 hours) and has a highly unbalanced difficulty which sucks since you'll try doing the same areas until your fingers bleed.

If you liked Vegas 1 you'll love Vegas 2 but this game is only for R6 fans. If you have never played the first game (you can pick it up for $20 or so on eBay) then go ahead and pick this game up.",Vegas 2 adds a lot of features that the first was missing
B00LKV44FU,4.0,"is very cool and very easy to use, i very enjoy play with this headset chatting with my friend while playing.

B0016NM7BU,4.0,"This game surprised me. I didn't expect it to be instantly fun, but it was. The racing style is SSX like, except better. You perform tricks to gain points while you race. And the tricks are outrageous and cool to perform. If you play with other people, you'll be screaming, ""Ohhhhhhhh!"", when you or others miss the insane tricks.

Another thing that surprised me was the graphics. I haven't been impressed by graphics for a long time. This game actually got me excited enough to call some of my friends over so that they could check out the graphics. The lighting, detail and environments are great to look at.

Even if you think this isn't your cup of tea, at least try the demo.",Arcade racing with ATVs
B006GHA8EE,4.0,"'Witcher 2' is at once an easy and difficult recommendation. CD Projekt RED's port of their celebrated PC game carries everything I want in an RPG: a complex narrative, terrific voice-acting, great combat, a world I want to get lost in and some of the best graphics I've seen on the XBOX 360. Unfortunately it also requires you to invest a lot of your time and patience to get the most out of it and there are moments where some may feel that price is a bit steep.

The Story of 'Witcher 2' involves Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster-hunter or titular ""Witcher"", who has amnesia and is regarded as a hero for his actions in the previous game (only available on PC). An unknown figure from his past is going around killing monarchs and Geralt finds himself framed and on the run in a quest to find this mysterious assassin. Along the way Geralt get's involved in politics, conspiracies, monster-hunting and conflicts between humans and non-humans. It's a simple enough setup but the overall plot ends up being VERY complex, asking you to absorb lots of information at a time (even more so if you follow every dialogue path like I do) and your in-game character-index becomes indespensable. Nothing ever rings false though and even with tons of branching options I felt rewarded for putting in the extra effort.

In fact the writing of 'Witcher 2' is easily it's biggest asset and the world it presents puts some interesting (and dark) spins on familiar fantasy tropes. Human's wage war with each other over sexual jealousy. Elven nationalists engage in Guerilla warfare with anyone trespassing in their forests (and could eat the Dragon Age Dalish for breakfast). Trolls would rather build bridges and drink vodka than kill people. Even Geralt himself, with his clear-eyed perspective and wry-humor behaves more like a cynical detective than the usual fantasy hero.

When you're not making kingdom-changing decisions or getting snarky with self-serious elves and interrogators, 'Witcher 2' has you exploring the world (which is loaded with shops and mini-games) and solving problems for other characters. These encounters can be anything from fetch-quests to simple monster-hunting, but most of them have you following different threads and you end up finding more to each conflict then is immediately present. What starts as a simple rescue mission can end up uncovering a kingdom-wide conspiracy (again, with dire consequences). Like the story, the missions don't hold your hand as there's usually no clear-cut quest markers and fast-travel. This helps with the immersion but can frustrate players used to more accessible RPG's like Skyrim.

The combat in 'Witcher 2' seems straight-forward at first but requires some strategic thinking as you play. While button-mashing with the newest gear can get you out of some conflicts, the tougher confrontations require you to pay attention to Geralt's stance and place on the battlefield. You also have to mix and match magic/trap abilities with your martial skills which makes leveling up decisions just as much about strategy as the combat. It's a system I found very satisfying, though I would've liked more weapon variety (usually Geralt just has his two swords and maybe a sidearm).

'Witcher 2' is not without it's faults, however and the sometimes PC-centric elements of the port can make things frustrating. While combat is dynamic, having to target specific enemies is hit and miss and the game offers no easy way to switch between targets. The same goes for exploration and trying to do anything precise like talking to specific characters or target certain objects to pick up. The menus are also a chore to sort through with no quick way to bring up maps and character sheets; the inventory screen is sometimes a puzzle in and of itself. There's nothing ""game breaking"" here but 'Witcher 2' isn't as smooth as a console RPG should be.

There's so much to 'Witcher 2' I always feel like I'm leaving something out when talking about it. It's obviously not for everyone as it's PC-ness shows through a bit too much and the story-dumps are an investment in and of themselves. But if you're craving a complex RPG narrative with moral-ambiguity and consequences that make a difference (along with the great combat) then 'Witcher 2' is not to be missed!","A complicated, but rewarding Action-RPG"
B00WTI3JPE,4.0,"This is one of the more involved RPG's that I have played in a while.  That's not a bad thing.  I like games with more depth.  Lots of customization as far as equipment, powers, potions, skills, etc.  Although, one thing missing is character customization.  You play the main character (on the box), the Witcher ,and that's it.  Like most RPG's of today, there is the main story and many side missions.  You can explore around on your own and earn some money/experience, then get back to the main mission as you please.  One thing I need to bring up though, it's hard.  This game can be punishing at times.  Death is frequent in the early stages.  I've had to start over from scratch a few times already.  Many of the encounters you will face in the wild will be a lot more than you can handle.  They also threw in the dreaded equipment maintenance nonsense.  Your armor/weapons will degrade with use and will need repair.  That costs money.  Yup, you guessed it, money is scarce.  So, you really have to play carefully and not rush in to fights everywhere.  I found myself at times with no money and my hardware falling apart.  Not a good situation.  Strategy is very important.  Knowing the weaknesses of your enemy makes a huge difference between frustration and having fun.  Don't ignore the potions.  These are really a key element of the game.  It can be tedious at times having to gather ingredients, but it's necessary.  That being said, I still give it thumbs up.","Pretty hard for the casual gamer, but rewarding."
B005B8DRVU,4.0,"So I've been playing Star Wars the Old Republic. (yeah that's where I've been)

Troopers story missions are awesome. Felt like a soldier in the kotor period, they are very well written with a minimum of the typical mmo garbage missions.

Got to level 20 and discovered most of my guildies are like level 10 or less.

So I started rolling a Jedi Knight..... and the missions on the starting planet? Are Horrible until the -very- tail end. They consist of the usual MMO Garbage Busy Work missions. Just with voice acting... woooo great job Bioware. Give the non force guys the great content (smugglers also get really awesome starter missions) and screw the Force guys which -everyone- and their kid brother is going to play as their first toon.

I suspect initial reviews of TOR are going to be dramatically on opposite ends of the spectrum.. those that played Trooper and Smuggler... and those that played Force users.

I've got some other gripes like the Jedi Knight being nigh worthless compared to the Trooper to the point where missions that me and a buddy rolled over on our first (as Trooper and Smuggler it was still hard too)try took -several- as a Jedi Knight and Jedi Consular. Combat needs to be abit more mobile for ranged characters and I'd like to see an actual cover system put in place along with some more clutter on the maps to break line of sight etc.

Overall though, the game is beautiful, and so very well polished that it's hard to come up with serious complaints beyond balance issues, and starter zone quests for the republic Force Users. I think Bioware though took the Too Safe route and I think it's going to backfire. WOW's bleeding subs because people don't want to Kill X of Y anymore. People don't want to grind to infinitely increasing levels. I mention the last one, because with the way the skill points work out in TOR I can definitely tell they plan on upping the cap at some later date. A move that I don't think is going to help them in the long run. No not all sucessful MMOs do it either. That's one of the reasons RIFT did, and is still doing so well, they understand that people want Content, not more Levels and yet more abilities for an already over taxed and over crowded set of ability trays.

The game is also quite linear and I think they botched partly what made Mass Effect so great. In ME I could go anywhere and pick up missions on my level in this game.. not so much. It makes it feel like you have alot less freedom (because you do) than in MMOs or even Mass Effect.

Also, Guild building, and perks? Non Existent. There isn't even an Events Page, or message wall!  This is Criminal in a modern MMO. Especially when they were doing their damndest to promote guild building, and community building pre launch.

Overall though again the game is very good, and if Bioware would just add in, and address a couple of the things I've mentioned this Will Be the Wow Killer, instead of just the Major Contributor to it's demise, just enough flaws to keep me from giving it a full Five Stars, is it better than WOW? Oh God Yes. Is it better than RIFT? I'd say it's about even with it.

Now, as for the Collector's Edition. Were the goodies worth it?  I have a 9 inch highly detailed... no very highly detailed statue. A journal, and soundtrack. The statue I think is why the collectors had cost me so much. (by the way thanks amazon for screwing up my order and not being able to fix it... Gamestop got my business because of it and I'm never preordering anything from you guys again) But it really is beautiful. I would have preferred to have a Trooper statue instead or maybe the female Jedi in the opening scene instead. But the actual quality and style of the thing was worth it. Everything else is just a bonus. The collector's vendor in game Sucks, the security key vendor (which induces it's own headache since I need the key fob just to play the game every day. (Gee Thanks EA... Give me something I can lose or run out of batteries for)  is far far better. The Holo Girl was cool, and pair of pets are entertaining. But ultimately I think this stuff has to stay in your inventory to use.... which sucks. The Holocamera... is worthless. The stuff in the actual game box basically is the whole reason to get this game's Collector's if you can still find it. (and I wish you luck!)","If this doesn't kill WOW, it'll definitely Contribute."
B00004WLQV,4.0,"This is my first play station 2 game, I have been waiting to get this game ever since I herd about it, that has been a while now. Since I have been waiting for this game I held great  expectations for this; I was disipointed.

B001N1C1J8,4.0,"I waited until the demo came out four months after this game was released before buying it.  I was thoroughly convinced by the demo that there was something special about Demigod, but knew that the game would need to be supported with new content if it was going to thrive.  Anyone interested in this game should definitely try the free demo.  Not everyone will like this blend of role-playing and real-time strategy gaming, but I found Demigod a well-conceived mix of the two.

Gameplay: The story and objectives of the game are fairly straightforward. You select 1 of 8 demigods, fight other demigods on 1 of 8 maps, and try to satisfy the win condition, whether that means destroying the enemy citadel, killing the most demigods, or capturing and holding flags.  You can pick a demigod assassin or general.  The only difference between the two is that generals can summon minions to help them; however, generals--with the right equipment--can be as strong as assassins.  The gameplay can get pretty intense early on as your team tries to hold flags, destroy towers, and push toward the enemy headquarters, all while avoiding being killed.  Much of the fun comes from customizing your demigod with abilities and various equipment, while upgrading your citadel to produce more gold, better reinforcements, and other things. The game is a classic race against time as your team tries to ""level up"" and gain map control before the enemy does.

The game is primarily built for multiplayer, but can be played with and against AI demigods.  There is no single-player campaign beyond a tournament which consists of 8 skirmishes.  It's no big loss; I really can't tell how a single-player campaign would fit into a game like this.  There are hotkeys for most commands, and the user interface is pretty logical.  The game has only a few shortcomings.  The first (and major) one is the amount of content.  Eight demigods is a decent amount to start with, but will get a bit dull after several weeks of playing. Same with the maps.  Stardock is planning to release 2 free demigods shortly, along with modding tools.  However, to remain fresh for the long haul, the game will need a steady trickle of demigods and maps. Modders may be able to give this game some longevity.  Whatever the case, the game has a solid core; it just needs more content over the coming months (an official expansion with plenty of content would be a welcome addition).

Graphics: Beautiful games.  The maps themselves are works of art.  Each of the demigods is greatly detailed and has a good range of animations.  Special effects are also well done.

Sound: Solid soundtrack, convincing sound effects, and appropriately over-the-top voice acting.  The game has a lot of character, which is one of its strengths.

Technical issues/documentation: The game comes with a manual which explains the basics.  However, it should have gone into much greater detail regarding the demigods themselves and the available items and artifacts.  On a technical note, since I bought the game 4 months after release, many of the initial multiplayer connectivity problems have been fixed.  There is still the occasional lag and desync error, but overall the multiplayer is fine now after the patches.  Since the game is integrated with Stardock's Impulse system, you have to register it online in order to get updates.  Unlike Steam, Impulse does not run in the background when you play the game.  However, like Steam, Impulse does tie the game to an individual account, thus killing the game's resale value (to its credit, Stardock, unlike Steam, did allow for refunds for a while).

Replayability/Value: The game has huge replay value, but much will depend on future support and modding.  Beyond the two free demigods that should become available in the next few weeks, Stardock (and the developer, Gas Powered Games) will need to continue providing bug fixes, refining the network code, and adding content.  At the very least, modders will need tools so that they can step up to the plate and show the game some love.  I recommend the game, but also recommend that potential buyers play the demo first.

Pros:
+Fun and innovative gameplay
+Diverse mix of demigods
+Gorgeous graphics
+Solid music, voices, and sound effects
+Huge amount of potential if supported properly

Cons:
-A bit thin on initial content
-Spotty network code at release
-Somewhat inadequate manual
-No resale value (due to online registration with Impulse)",Great game--just needs some ongoing support

B0012NWBH4,4.0,"Between this game and Advance Wars Dual Strike, I will say Dual Strike gets a slight edge. Dual Strike sticks extremely close to the original Advance Wars formula laid out from the prior two games on GBA. But that is not a bad thing, those are near-perfect portable strategy games. Days of Ruin tried to be adventurous. They changed the art style and atmosphere to a much harsher more dark one. The story is almost adult-level sci-fi but told in a kid-friendly way (creeper virus makes pretty flowers pop out of you and pics are non-gory, other sci-fi viruses like zombie stuff etc. get really gory on other hand) and the story looks at the bleak situation of desperate people after comets blast Earth. Starvation, political manipulations of shady mayors, it's the script of a good B-grade movie that would at least beat out the SyFy channel garbage movies.

As far as gameplay goes there is balance changes for vets of the series. First of all the AI is stop notch. Dual Strike really upped the ante with it's AI over the GBA games but this one I feel takes the AI even further, it can be a challenge until you get really good. As for balance changes I will list off the ones I can think of quick: There is a new infantry unit on motorcycles, cheaper and weaker than a jeep and not quite as fast but faster than normal infantry and they can capture buildings like normal infantry. Mechs are 2500cr instead of 3k, this is huge as you can accept the loss of mechs more easily and use them to eat away tanks more. Anti-tank artillery is like normal artillery except it has armor similar to a Md tank, costs 11000cr, and can fire just as far as artillery as well as point blank. This unit can be quite overpowering because it can also counterattack like a normal tank. Standard tanks cannot kill this thing easily, and at 11000cr they are 5000cr cheaper than Md tanks and can really hurt a map of infantry and tanks. The gunboat has only 1 shot that can do about 75% damage to an enemy ship and can carry a single infantry unit, the duster is a propeller plane that is cheap and is basically an airborne jeep, best for countering helicopters. There is a new flare tank that can reveal a good 3-3 range on a map with fog of war.

Summary: This game plays like any other Advance Wars game but the large amount of additions and balance changes makes it play differently. Some of the same strategies that worked in the rest of the series don't pan out as well in this one. The atmosphere doesn't feel as good as the original games, almost like it tries too hard to be edgy with the darker art and heavy electric-guitar rock-type music riffs but stays within PG-13 or below ratings. Good game, it's still Advance Wars at it's core, this is just a different flavor.

B0016G88RO,4.0,"I found this game while looking for a Splinter Cell-type fix, and it sounded like a good alternative. It's a fairly decent game with its own brand of play mechanics, and open-ended, intricate and adult storyline of shifting alliances, and it mainly relies on RPG, shooting, hand-to-hand combat and line-of-sight stealth (not that many shadow to hide in) -- and choosing quickly what you want to say. Dialogue IS important here. Alpha managed to pose quite a few challenges of its own, which you CAN'T solve by going gung-ho -- you have to approach this one tactically.

That said, there are often several solutions to each puzzle or obstacle, and they depend on your skill allocation. Sure, you can evolve your rifle shooting skills to Rambo level and TRY to outgun your many, not-as-stupid enemies (they don't stay there waiting for you to come and kill them), but you'll also want to leave some mojo to your lockpicking, stealth, conversational and hacking skills. Here it's better to have a well-rounded operative so you can hold your own in a variety of scenarios.

Again, do NOT buy this if you expect a regular shooter. It does hold up on its own though. The reason I removed a star has to do with the control-point save system, which always spoils some of the fun for me, and the undocumented bug that causes dialog choices not to appear if you force your driver to anti-alias the game, which can't do this on its own, at least not in the PC version.

It's actually pretty darn cool. The world is very well-realized, with lots of cool characters, and great execution. But...it's hard. I'm no newbie to gaming, and I'm having a hard time getting very far in it. Granted, I haven't given it a whole lot of time/effort at this point, but such is my gaming life. I don't have a whole lot of time to devote to gaming, so when I do sit down to play, I want to feel like I'm making progress. So far, that hasn't been tremendously the case with this game. Fortunately, what I have played has been great fun, so I'll keep at it. I just wish they had more ability to scale the difficulty back a bit. Generally, though, definitely recommended.","Great game, well executed, but hard."
B001Q9ZTM8,4.0,"Placed them (bought two of them) on the DSi Lites for the kids. They provide extra battery life and it is a good safeguard for the ""just in case"" moments with kids who can drop things out of nowhere. The only issue I have is that the Stylus slot is not good. I had to do minor surgery to remove a stylus placed in it because the ejection spring in them was not working. So since there are two and the problem exists with both of them I think it is a defective design and not the item itself.

But I otherwise like this product. Too bad I could not find one for the DSi XL, that would have been great.","Like It, Would Buy Again"

B0050SY5BM,4.0,"Medal of Honor: Warfighter is one of the most enjoyable shooters I've played in some time. The single player campaign was thoroughly immersive and even portions I normally don't enjoy (car chases, for example) were set up so that repeated trial and error allowed you to advance. The combat, the weapons, the diversity of missions and terrain and settings all felt realistic and were a blast. I just wish there was more of it. I think I finished the campaign in about 6-8 hours (and I'm older and a slower gamer ;-). I could see others finishing in 4-5 hours and $60 is a bit much for games that short.

I played multi-player a bit and it didn't really hold my attention like the Call of Duty series. It feels a lot more realistic, a lot more one-shot, one-kill in Medal of Honor, but the fact that it doesn't support same console split-screen coop as part of it's special forces multiplayer mission sort of forces you to play online in two-man teams with near strangers and that isn't super conducive to the type of stealth and support tactics necessary in this seriously hard core multi-player mode.

If the single player campaign had been longer (maybe twice as long) and the multi-player supported same console coop missions, I would have given this a 5 star rating.",Short but sizzling single-player experience
B0007LWMRG,4.0,"Imperial Glory covers the mid point in European imperialism, The game mainly plays out the Napoleonic Wars combined with the industrial revolution.  All this lumped together in a campaign that well, is longgggg.  Quick battles (land and naval)are great and stimulating. They include a pause, real time point and click order, with very slow to very fast speed of play and the naval side has a wind gauge.  The campaign AI is designed to play out as if it were the 1791-1820's, (3 levels of difficulty)with each nations armies evenly matched to some degree.  This is the best game covering the the age of Napoleon!....
  I am still playing this game after 6 months of play. I place alot of priority on 3D graphics and they are good. You can move the camera all around units and buildings during battles.
  Game Pros. Unit graphics, naval battles, easy command and control of units during battles,game pause and save adilities,  beautiful terrian, straight forward technology tree and game play.
  Game Cons. Limited number of unit types, and regions to control, weak AI compared to the MTW and RTW series, cannot mod game with microsoft.

B002I08RA0,4.0,"3D glasses come with Assassin's Creed. The paper type like you used to get when you went to a movie theater.  It is supposed to work with a 2D TV but it looks lame in my opinion.

If you liked any of the previous Assassin's Creed games I think you will like this version also. The underling tones in this game are very similiar to AC II but the gameplay has more nuance.

While the graphics are very good (without the glasses), they do not take your breath away.

The game doesn't require expert controller know-how. Any noob can bash buttons and come out on top in combat. As always the in game camera works well.

There are new types of battles in this version.  One version is like a tower defense. You can put a master assassin on a rooftop which allows you to put crossbow and riflemen on the rooftop also. Now you can shoot at characters below in the streets. It is an innovative way to overcome enemies. Something besides just bashing buttons.

You can turn the blood effects off in this game but even if you did it would be considered violent.

B000066RKC,4.0,"First of all, as one of the biggest John Carpenter fans (I even kind of liked Ghosts of Mars) that I know, I was both eagerly anticipating and dreading this game. I knew that there was no way for it to live up to the 1982 film, but I was hoping that it would. I am both pleased and somewhat disappointed. As a Carpenter fan I enjoyed the way that the game managed to build upon the film. You do find out who was infected at the end of the movie (was is MacReady or was it Childs) and you get to look at the spaceship that Blair (A.k.a Wilford Brimley) was  building - and all of this happens in the playable prologue in a visit to the site of the original film. The nice mood that the game builds up in this prologue (and trust me, its really creepy) eventually winds down into a rather average first person shooter. Now, as a fan of both half-life AND all of the resident evil games (yes, even survivor!) I like first person shooters as much as I like survival horror games - but this ends up being almost too much of the former. While much has been said here about all of the great aspects of this game, little has been said about what just doesn't quite work. Yes, the whole trust aspect of the game is interesting - but there are problems. Certain squad members only follow you so far during levels before they change into a version of the thing and attack you (i.e. they will change just before you fight a boss - they won't go any further - so whether you kill them when they are a thing or save yourself some health and just put a bullet in their head before it happens is up to you. I prefer the latter since it saves ammo and it usually takes off the top of their head in a nifty video game gore way.) Now, I have no problem with this - it was in the movie and so it should be here. However, I see no point in being able to test the blood of your squad if they change into the Thing whether or not the blood test comes back positive or negative. Why even put the blood test in the game? So far, I have had about 5 team members - all of whom who have changed into the monster despite my giving them blood tests in which they tested negative for being infected. So that's a problem.
Second, the real time weapon switching (as opposed to Resident Evil, in which you have to switch to an inventory menu) can be really frustrating. Espescially when you are looking for a weapon, scrolling through a list, and getting jumped by five of those hopping chicken things from half-life. I've been killed many times because I pulled up a sniper rifle instead of my shotgun. Also, the weapon icons are so small that its hard to tell the difference between weapons - and since I only have a 29"" TV - it can be tough.
The controls are much nicer than the ""turn and move design of resident evil - however, since (at least on playstation two) the same joystick you move with is also the crouch button, I often find myself trying to run from a particularly tough foe, only to find myself duck walking away in a crouch since I pushed down on the joystick nub while running.
All in all this game is great for the gamer who likes survival horror or for the fan of the Carpenter film who has never played R.E. or Devil May Cry or Silent Hill. However, it will never replace R.E. Code Veronica in my collection.",My Thing Review

B0002A6CQ4,4.0,"I loved Resident Evil (the Gamecube remake) and I thought that Zero was quite a lot of fun too (I never did play 2 or 3 as they were just ported onto the Gamecube straight from the PS1) but while Resident Evil 4 is an improvement in terms of graphics and hardware it doesn't have any atmosphere or the overwhelming sensation of dread and fear. This is basically down to the style of gameplay.

Gone are the spooky camera angles for a start. Instead, this time the camera is constantly behind Leon, following him in whatever direction he goes. It's a bit tricky at first but after a few minutes you'll get the hang of it. Also, the game is not really about exploration and mystery solving and you never really go back to the same place twice. Okay, this is a good thing in some ways as it did get a little annoying before (the 'door-opening' cutscenes are also gone) and I understand the gameplay of the franchise had to evolve but, the way it is, RE 4 just feels like a shoot-em-up.

In your long, long journey (the game is absolutely MASSIVE) Leon visits a rickety European village that seems stuck in the dark ages, onto an old castle, then to a creepy island and on into a huge fortress and laboratory. In this respect it feels a LOT like a Dungeon Siege game in regards to the constant running around in torchlit catacombs, killing big insects, collecting treasures, trading/building up your stats and weapons and looking for that way out which seems to be miles away through endless, labyrinthine corridors.

All you really do in this game is go forward and shoot. And it gets quite boring after the halfway mark. There is some very slight puzzle-solving but I suspect this was only put in to satisfy hardcore RE fans.

There are plenty of pros, like the brilliant graphics, the sheer size of the game is impressive, the cool extras and mini-games awarded after finishing (I did it in 15 hours and I WON'T be going through it again) and faster loading times. But the boredom of killing the zillionth evil henchman and his twin really gets mind-numbingly dull after hour 10.

I finished this in 6 days (the original and Zero took me much longer) so I suggest you rent this if your not the obsessive RE collector type. While it is a great-looking game and very slick, it just didn't keep me as thrilled (or as scared) as it could have.",Wears thin fast

What makes it fun is the diverse musical backgrounds each game offers, some more catchy than others.

I had some trouble with a few of the games and often was left wondering if it was my lack of musical talent or the games interface. Whichever reason, I often had to give up for a while and then return to finish the challenge.

B00006IJJK,4.0,"As a FPS-phobiac, I don't know why I picked up this game. I'm glad I did, though. With this game, Nintendo has tackled yet another genre with aplomb, adding FPS to a list that already includes platformers (Mario), action/adventures (Zelda), and RPGs (Pokemon and Paper Mario).

I loved the approach to first-person combat. The controls are smooth as silk, and make it easy to move and shoot at the same time. Weapon and visor switching can be done at the press of a button. Overall, I found the game's controls very easy to master. The game itself, however, was another matter.

The level of difficulty here fried my nerves to no end. I would walk carefully through an area, my heart beating frantically as I wondered when the next group of space pirates was going to leap down and ruthlessly attack me. There are almost no ""grunt""-type enemies in the game. Each and every one proves a genuine threat. And don't even get me started on the bosses--not only do they make you know fear with their rabid behavior, but they'll decimate you within seconds if you're screwing around. You'll cry with relief every time you reach a checkpoint and can save your progress. I would reccomend buying a strategy guide so you can figure out where to go and where the power-ups are, but even when you know what to do, it doesn't make doing it any easier. Without a doubt, this is the most intense, nerve-racking, scary, and difficult game I have ever played. And then you can play Hard mode, if you enjoy pain.

So with all that, why do I still adore this game? Well, whenever I would actually get to a save point/beat a boss/get a power-up/etc., I would feel like the bomb. Even though I used a strategy guide, I still felt like an uber-gamer every time I accomplished something.

You've heard me mention power-ups several times now. Well, there's a reason for that: they rock. Torching fools with my Heat Ray is one of the funnest things I've ever done. The Super Missles aren't too shabby either, especially when I shattered that Omega Pirate's knees. The different visors (such as Thermal, X-Ray, etc.) all have neat views. And they're not only cool, they each have puzzle-solving capabilities, so they're useful too. And once you have all the essentials, you can collect the dozens of energy and missle expansions. They're all fun to get, and absoloutely necessary to beating the final boss.

As I used all my cool powers, screamed in terror at bosses and regular enemies alike, racked my brain for strategies, navigated the environments (which also rock--they have all kinds of clever nooks and crannies to explore, and the graphics are amazing), whooped with joy when I beat a boss, and investigated the depths of the game's story (there are no cutscenes, but by scanning objects, an interesting plot develops), I realized something: I was not just playing a game. I was having a life experience--one that rivaled any other, ""real-life"" accomplishment. Buy this game, and you too will go on the ride of a lifetime.",Frustrating First-Person Fun!

B000GI7LOO,4.0,"I'm a big fan of simluation games: Sim City was one of my favorites (until the program got so demanding of my computer that it couldn't hold the upgrades!). I also loved Rollercoaster Tycoon. The aspects of designing and managing an amusement park appealed to my creative side; making those rollercoasters that made even the most stalwart riders sick was quite a thrill! So when I saw ""Thrilville"" for PS2, I was thrilled.

I hesitated buying the game at first, though. Much too often, I've purchased PS2 games that have interested me, only to find out that they are really made for kids, and the challenge aspect of the game isn't there for adults. So I waited, read some reviews, and then decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was glad that I did!

Thrillville is a riff on the popular ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" game, and borrows some of the same elements. You are a park manager, required to build, plan, and improve Thrillville, a somewhat lackadaisical and dying theme park. You are thrown into the park, and within two minutes, you can be designing, or redesigning rollercoasters for your patrons. Your job is to improve the park so much that the next park becomes unlocked. You are given different missions in the park to perform (each mission has a success rate at gold, silver, or bronze). While, as an adult, I feared these missions would be dull or repetitive, they actually turned out to be one of the fun aspects of the game. I enjoyed having to train the staff (and don't worry, for you R Tycoon fans, there are NO lawn-mowing janitors in this game!), and enjoyed interacting with the people. Playing the mini-games also provided to be a fun surprise, although some of them are irritating at best! You'll recognize some of the mini-games as take-offs on old popular video games of the past.

My favorite part, hands down, is the coaster designs. It is incredibly easy to design a coaster for this game. The game offers tutorials to teach you, but honestly, I never looked at one. I just went in and started building. The individual pieces of the coasters are cheap enough that money never really becomes a huge issue in the game. You can design all types of thrilling turns, spins, loops, and corkscrews, depending on the type of coaster you design. One tricky aspect is that coasters take up a lot of electricity, so be wary of how long your coaster is. And one lesson that I learned: scarier is NOT always better, especially in the parks that are more ""family friendly"".

Overall, I have really enjoyed Thrillville. I never found anything super challenging, and found most of my experience just plain fun. For the last few nights, I've been dreaming of roller coaster design.... so maybe it's time that I return to reading some books instead of spending hours in ""Thrillville""!",Going to the amusement park!

B00C71034I,4.0,"This is a very good game.  Is it the best Arkham game?  No.  Is it the best open world game?  No.  But it does shed different light on Arkham series.  Overall, there are two sides to Batman - the 1) 'World's Greatest Detective' and 2) The Bat on the edge of sanity.  The first two Arkham games were definitely a trip through insanity (#2).  This game focuses more on the detective side (#1).  Where the first two Arkham games could be considered 'twisted', this game is much better characterized as 'dark'.

Gameplay- The core mechanics of the gameplay are intact from the previous iterations of the franchise, and despite the new developer, feels much like the first two as far as the way the game responds to you.  The brawling fights are actually upgraded - more diversified enemy types which add variety to the game.  However, about half way through the game, you get a gadget (I won't say what so as not to spoil the story) that literally negates all of the variety of the enemy types and turns all of the enemies into typical grunts.  For fans of the series or for those wanting a little more challenge, I recommend not using this gadget in combat.  The predator side of the gameplay virtually the same, but the levels for predator encounters are probably a little better - the original Arkham games typically featured rectangular rooms with evenly spaced gargoyles around the ceiling.  In this game, the predator levels are much more varied, which require a lot more strategy.  Furthermore, this game has THE BEST boss battles in the series.  These battles can be quite difficult and require a lot of timing in order to succeed.  So, positive scores across the board for gameplay, but the one 'super gadget' makes the combat far too easy.

Story- This is an origins story meant to fit before the original Arkham Asylum game.  As such, it does a decent job paving the way for the original game.  A common complaint I've heard is that the game is not really an 'Arkham' game.  While the game does not take place at a facility that is called 'Arkham', this is still an adequate prequel.  Much of the action takes place at Blackgate prison, which can be seen as a precursor to the Arkham Asylum facility (this isn't a spoiler, since the first scene of the game drops you into Blackgate).  The story's biggest weakness is that it falls prey to the 'checkbox syndrome'.  In telling an origins story, there are certain boxes that need to be checked off in order to fit with accepted canon.  The original Arkham games did not need to check any boxes, and were therefore free to tell the story that they wanted to.  This game, however, stutters a little when it has to take time out of the game's story in order to tell some of 'Batman's story'.  However, that said, the story is quite strong.  There are a few good twists (nothing of the level of games like Bioshock Infinite), but things that make the game more involved than simply fighting off a couple of assassins that have come to kill you (once again, not a spoiler - this is on the back of the game box).

Graphics- I'm not a graphics snob, but there are times when the graphics look great, and other times when they don't.  The game seems to cut to more cut scenes than previous installments, which allows the game to significantly boost the graphics for pivotal parts of the story.  The non-cut scenes, on the other hand, look just like the original two games, which are arguably outdated.

Glitch- Shortly after the game was released (I got it on day 1), I read about a save corrupting/freezing glitch and had a flashback to Hitman:Absolution (where I lost my entire game due to a corrupted save).  This time, I didn't take any chances - I backed up my game saves to a separate storage location, so I could restore it if my saves were ever corrupted.  Luckily, it didn't happen.  I did have the game freeze about 3 times in my entire playthrough, but I simply hard powered off the machine and rebooted.  Backing up the saves added a minute or two to my playing, and resetting from freezing only took a few minutes x3 times.  Overall, the glitch does exist, but it isn't the end of the world - it isn't a 'broken' game, but it definitely needs to be patched.

Overall, this game gets a 4/5 in my book.  It isn't as good as the original two Arkham games.  Also, immediately prior to this game, I played through GTA V and Splinter Cell Blacklist.  Blacklist is a better stealth game than Arkham Origins, GTA V is a better open world game than Arkham Origins.  However, Arkham Origins is still just fun.  It makes you feel like Batman, and provides an interesting take on the story leading up to the original Arkham games.  If the Arkham series were released in story order (meaning this game first, then Asylum, then City), then this game would get a lot of praise for being a good, even great, Batman game.  However, this game can't quite seem to get out of the huge shadow that was set by the original games.","Different, but good"

The main story makes sense and flows well. I wish there was more interaction with the other members in your group like in the first one. Your interactions are limited in this game.

The things I did not like:
-Most of the story takes place in the city. You end up running from one side of the city to the other. Again, the quests are fine, but it would have been better to make quests outside of the city.
-Speaking with your team can only occur at his/her house. I missed having the camp so you could speak to all your members at one time.
-The story just ends. You have no idea where your character is and once you complete the game, you cannot continue to play or wander the town. Your character is stuck in the house.

Overall, it is a good and entertaining game, but the ""open"" feel of the first game was a little better. It took me about 40 hours to complete the game. Would have liked for it to be a little longer.",Good RPG
B002I0K6Q8,4.0,"Street Fighter X Tekken is a great fighting game. Tekken purists may or may not like it, cause this game is suited more towards 2d street fighter gameplay, some tekken fans might find the change as something diffrent and good for once but its aimed more towards street fighter fans as it was made by Capcom. However there's also a sequel in the making that is being aimed at tekken fans that is being made at Namco. Graphics in the game while cartoony (agian street fighter styled)are good maybe not the best and not to much improvement since Street Fighter IV but it keeps the game running fluid. Gameplay is where this game shines as while it is on a 2d plain and has the speed and style of street fighter think Tekken tag tournament when it comes to rules since the tag system is if one person is knocked out your team loses even if the other person is at full health.  They only problem I had with the gameplay was playing online when it first came out it lagged to the point where the game was almost unplayable that way however more recently since its been patched and updated it runs just as smoothly as the single player minus a few sound problems sometimes. My other problem with the game is the ""disc locked content"" that makes you pay $20 for characters already on the disc. While I admit it is a ripoff and should have been free I'm pretty sure its not the first game to do that or pressure you into paying dlc for. Which speaking of characters theres 50+(ps3 version) of them on here and while a few of the characters in the game it could have done without (pacman, megaman) most of them fit very well into the game. Anyway I would recommend this game to any one who likes old school fighting games as this is a very good *street fighter* game and one of my favorites. (my personal faviorte is alpha 3 though)I think some tekken fans might want to rent it first but if you liked both or street fighter I would recomend it since its going down in price fast.","If you can look pass the ""disc locked Content"" its a great fighting game"

B000FDOXL4,4.0,"Let's get one thing out of the way right now. Every ""Kart"" game on the market is a rip off of Mario Kart. Even several Mario Kart entries come off as rip offs of Mario Kart. This game is no exception.
That being said... It's a pretty darn good rip off of Mario Kart. The levels are fun, many recalling classic stages from the Pac-Man World Trilogy. Classic elements like pac-dots and fruit pick-ups make an appearance. The ability to fill your meter and eat your opponents is well implemented. Racers are divided into the common ""light, medium, heavy"" we've seen before, and most of them are a hoot. I especialy liked the new, Steampunk looking Toc-Man. Less welcome is the unlockable ""Prince"" from some game series about rolling stuff into a ball. I know nothing about his games (clearly) but he doesn't fit with the visual style of the game as well as the critters from ""Dig dug"" do. And his race track is ugly, too.
The final track, a mock up of a Pac-Man arcade maze, with Mr. & Ms. Pac-Man playing from outside, is very clever and my favorite race of the game. It doesn't always hold to the high standards set by the racing plumber, but it comes very close.",Leader of the Pac

The game started off well, then it started getting a little weirder, like when you have to punch back some hits from enemies, but the game wouldn't let you - this may be a glitch, or poor gameplay.

Thew game is about two twins dipper and Mable and they go to find mystery junk for their Gruncle Stan and with the game, the mystery junk is hard to get to, and you can't proceed till you gather all the junk.

B0007OGDIC,4.0,"Indigo Prophecy is in some ways a very innovative adventure game, and in other ways, extremely old fashioned with regards to the devices it puts you up against to get you through the story. Luckily, the game as a whole survives the weird amalgam of new and old school, and makes for an intrigueing and exciting experience.

The story is what makes the game stand out the most, though. You play as the hero Lucas Kane, who suddenly finds himslef commiting a brutal murder while seemingly under some kind of possession. It's up to you to figure out what made you (him?) do it, which involves evading the police and gaining the trust of people who can provide clues to unlocking the mystery. Gameplay is different to most 3rd person adventures I have played. You can control your character movements, but all actions other than moving around can only be performed when you see an icon on your screen that relates to a certain ""hotspot"" you have found. Opening a door, using the bathroom and pouring a drink are probably not the most exciting things you can do in a videogame, but they all have to be done in this one, and you do need to get comfortable with the quick response controls because when the tension rises, you have to start making some pretty sharp decisions. The best parts of the game are the bits where you have a crisis situation suddenly develop, such as suspicious police knocking at your door, or a pitch-dark basement crawling with escaped lunatics to escape from, and you need to think fast as well as control what your character does, often with an onscreen timer counting down on the time you have left. I enjoyed these sequences a lot, and you really do get the outcome you deserve based on the decisions you make in those vital seconds. This time-attack approach is also applied to many question and answer conversations with other characters...to get the most out of some encounters you must think quickly and choose appropriate questions (or responses ) from a limited choice before a timer runs out. This can be fun too, and as you can imagine, outcomes vary considerable based on your judgement.

 At other times, a different control scheme comes into play. At certain critical moments, the screen will present you with pictoral representations of directional commands that you must apply with both the left and right analogue sticks, to ensure the best outcome to a sequence. This could be Lucas taking flight from mysterious apparitions, or just playing his guitar tunefully enough to win back his estranged girlfriend. The on screen prompts can be quite punishing, as they invariably get faster and more complex as an action sequence nears its conclusion. Sometimes you are even told to repeatedly mash two buttons as fast as you can to perform some strenuous task such as lifting something very heavy - see what I mean about old school? All good finger-aching fun, though.

The look of the game is fairly polished, although the graphics are not incredibly detailed, but the atmoshphere is quite impressive. The characters are particularly well rounded, with good looking and well animated faces. Lucas makes an effective and realistic hero, and he's not the only playable character. You also get equal playing time with two police officers, Carla and Tyler. All three of these main characters have subtle personality traits and distinct emotions that make them really come alive. The voiceover work in the game is excellent, and there is a lot of it, as all conversations are spoken in full by the voice actors, and they do really good jobs.

I've enjoyed the experience of Indigo Prophecy so much I don't really want to draw attention to any flaws, but I think it would be positive to point them out as the game overall is so effective. Firstly the movement control for the characters is problematic. This is because the in-game camera is totally fluid, so it's constantly swooping around and changing viewpoint, which means your control over the direction you want to head in is continually and repeatedly undermined. In timed sequences (such as a flashback where the young Lucas must quickly find three boys hiding in a dangerous building before it explodes), this movement handicap is a hazard that can potentially ruin the mission for you. Secondly, the action sequences where you must move both analogue sticks in the directions flashing up on screen are some of the most exciting sections of the story...but you can't possibly watch the drama unfolding as your concentration has to stay glued firmly to the on-screen prompts so as not to muck up the sequence you have to follow. I only have a vague recollection of a very striking sequence in which Lucas' apartment literally disintegrates around him, because I was staring at coloured dots and trying to keep him alive, and I could not afford to blink and miss a single one. For the record, game designers, please don't show the best visuals in the game at a time when the players attention will be totally wrapped up in watching something else! A better idea would have been to run a ""wait for it"" visual sequence under the button pressing promtps, and then show the unfolding visuals as a reward.

My last point is rather more of a niggle - throughout the game, you switch between playing as Lucas, and the two police officers Carla and Tyler - yet your motivations for playing them are in direct opposotion to each other! As Lucas you must evade the police, and as Carla or Tyler you must track Lucas down and catch him. Yet whenever you play as either party, you are expected to play your hardest to make that character succeed. This seems most nonsensical in one sequence when, playing as Lucas, you must hide in an apartment as Tyler searches it. If you are found it's game over - yet from Tyler's point of view this would count as a victory. I found this very odd. I suppose the idea is to keep both parties heading forwards, but on a parallel course, so that the mystery can be fully unravelled before Lucas is wrongfully incarcerated by the law. I guess it doesn't ruin the game, and as the characters were all so well crafted, I did want them ALL to succeed, so I always appreciated victories on both sides. Even the rather salacious ones like helping Tyler's attempts to get some lovin' with his girlfriend, which shows the lighter side of the developers intentions.

I think Indigo Prophecy is a success, most obviously because I found it very hard to switch off every time I started playing, and if the few control issues are fixed, I would really relish playing a sequel. The storyline does take increasingly bizarre turns towards then end, and the pay-off is not as epic or rewarding as the mystery-filled early stages might have promised. Even so, with a ""choose your own adventure"" game like this, there's always replay value if you think you could have made better choices along the way, and I'm definitely glad I tried it.",Do and say what you want!
B00E44EZYA,4.0,My teenage grandson really enjoyed this game.,Four Stars
B001IK1BWC,4.0,"In the past, Computer RPGs have focused on many facets that make them fun. Puzzles, stories, combat and customization are perhaps the greatest assets of any RPG. Dragon Age is the best there is for half of these, and pretty good for the others.

Puzzles
-------
Dragon Age doesn't offer the kind of puzzles where you'd scratch your head and say ""How does that fit in?"" You won't push large blocks to fill in bridges or try to find the sword in the picture. Instead, Dragon Age offers most of its puzzles inside of dialog. You can try to talk your way out of a fight or find a way to draw out information from a possible informant.

Dragon Age also offers puzzles inside of the story. For instance, you may be faced with the task of trying to figure out a person's motive -- do they want to help you to hurt you in the end? Or are they really sincere?

Stories
-------
Dragon Age packs a ton of story into this game. Of course, it's a fairly stereotypical epic on the surface -- you must do X, Y and Z to save the world! The meat is in the details. Every choice you make can have an impact on the story. And you may find that the way the game seems to be pressuring you to save the world might not be your way. And if you start to pursue your way, you'll probably find that the writers of this game have given you the chance to pursue it (it might lead to your death, but you can still do it!).

The characters are all book-worthy. They have, well, character. They have pasts, goals and pet peeves. And if you're going to work effectively with them, you should try to figure otu what those pasts, goals and pet peeves are because the better they get along with you and your group, the better they fight.

Combat
------
Remember Dungeons and Dragons? Those rules were essentially the backbone to almost every Bioware game built. Not this time. Dragon Age provides a refreshingly new, simple and intuitive battle system. You can set it on easy and barely ever touch tactics or put it on hard and masterfully out-wit your enemies.

The AI is fair, but not perfect. Even so, you'll almost never lose immersion by thinking ""How can I outwit the AI into making it run endlessly into a wall while I kill it."" If it can see and hear you, it'll probably be coming after you with teeth bared.

If you are a high-strategy kind of player, this game won't offer you as much as some others, but if you turn up the difficulty, you'll likely have a good time.

Combat is only Real-Time w/ Pause. Some players who only like turn-based combat will find the combat too thick, fast, annoying and often for their likes.

Customization
-------------
Your skills and attributes are limited, but not so much that it feels restrictive. You can't cast a lot spells you wish you could (like Wish or Meteor Shower from NWN) and you can't slowly bald while casting spells (like in Fable), but you can craft your characters into the team you want them to be.

The greatest customization isn't in the stats anyway. It's in the dialog. You can be heroic, timid, good, evil or a mixture of all of them. You can take offense at people, be racist, sexist or just absent-minded. You can carry on conversations with hundreds of NPCs and your party. Your tongue is the greatest customizer available.

Conclusion:
If you're looking for an awesome game with a lot of story, then this is it.

WARNING:  This game can interfere with life. :D","A solid game, a brilliant RPG"
B002BRZ6UE,4.0,"This is a tough game to review because it does so many things well but has a few flaws that detracts from the generally solid FPS experience.

Here is my take:

+ Nicely-designed levels with good pacing and variety of missions.
+ Lengthy and challenging single-player missions with little ""fluff"". It took me about 10 hours to finish this on easy setting.
+ Some interesting weapon types. Weaspons feel great.
- Checkpoint system can be frustrating when set very far apart.
- Cloak system makes you feel somewhat underpowered, especially for a super-solider.

B00006C2HA,4.0,"I remember the original Doom quite fondly...I downloaded ""Doom: Knee Deep in the Dead"" back in the early 90's from a bulletin board and introduced it to a number of my Air Force squadron friends, who all got pretty much hooked on it. It was an enormous leap forward from it's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D, except with a much creepier setting. Plus it had a really cool multiplayer setup for it's day...you essentialy went through all the maps of the game either cooperatively or in deathmatch. That said I soon became the squadron champion in Doom, my weapon of choice the chainsaw naturally :)

My brothers got this for me for my birthday. I had heard that there were steep system requirements (a lot of people buy new rigs just to play this) and I was worried it wouldn't run well on my aging Athlon 1.8 with 1 gig of ram. At first it was a little clunky, so I turned the detail down to the lowest possible setting, which seems to have cured the worst of it. Still, even on the lowest detail setting, the graphics and sound are the most mind-blowing I have *ever* seen in a first person shooter...nay....in a game ever.

I'd like to say that Doom 3 is a bit of a departure from it's forebears, Doom 1 and Doom 2 (which was a Doom 1 clone which added new maps and a double barreled shotgun. That was the only difference). Actually it feels like the boys at iD, in an effort to increase the play value, added a few elements from other games in the genre, specifically AvP2 and dare I say it...I sense a lot of System Shock 2 in this as well. The atmosphere is incredibly spooky. The plot revolves around your character, a no-name marine, who gets transported to Union Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars research base. Along the way we're introduced to the other 4 big characters of the game; Sgt. Kelly, your CO, two corporate goons from Earth, Swann and Campbell, and the UAC Mars research leader, a creepy dude named Betruger with milky corneas. Your first mission is to go retrieve a rogue scientist deep within the bowels of the UAC compound and it is when you finally get to him the game really begins. Most of the base personnel become ""possessed"" and transform into zombies bent on finding you and presumably eating you. Yuck.

The game ultimately leads you on a wild chase. Betruger, who is somehow controlling this wild turn of events, is being pursued by Swann and Campbell, whom you catch brief glimpses of from time to time. Always one step ahead I would find myself shouting at the monitor ""Hey! wait up!"" whenever they ran by. The game brings out a whole lot of paranoia as you play. Suffice it to say that survivors on Mars are very rare and the rule of ""If it moves, shoot it"" is pretty safe. Keeping your link to humanity is your CO, Sgt. Kelly, who issues you orders via a series of video linkup displays and your built in radio. I really like this aspect of the game as it helps reduce the *overwhelming* loneliness of the game as you in essence spend so much of your time surrounded by flesh eating zombies and fire-throwing demons hell bent (pun intended) on killing you. An interesting addition is the PDA, which you use to keep track of tons of archives gathered from slain workers of the UAC complex and stores access codes for you. This particular nuance I feel must have been lifted *directly* from System Shock 2, where a similar device was used to listen to audio logs of fallen comrades.

The game is really creepy. iD Software didn't pull any punches with designing a foreboding atmosphere with this game. Hissing vents, bloody walls and floors, bodies strewn all over...the game wants to make you feel alone, and succeeds with panache. The weapons selection is premium, and I find myself able to use most of the weapons I acquire with great regularity. The shotgun will become a mainstay as the ammo supply for it is seemingly endless and it does great damage up close. The plasma gun is a thing of beauty and will make you feel all powerful as you use it. And of course the immortal chainsaw...I went all the way through the recycling center using nothing but it, and it made me feel like a Norse berserker!

And now the cons: The chaingun is powerful, but something of a letdown. You need a whole lot of space to use it, and the cramped rooms and hallways of the base just aren't conducive to it's use, or that of the seldom used rocket launcher. Further the chaingun eats ammo at a horrible rate...if you use it exclusively for one level you'll have to stow it for another 3 before you get enough ammo to really use it again. Dittos for the beautiful machine gun, which unfortunately eats ammo like popcorn.

Naturally the game being so dark there would need to be a portable lighting system with which to navigate your way through. iD gives you a flashlight. On paper this sounds good, but in reality it's a terrible tradeoff to force on the player. See your enemy vs. shoot at them blindly. The designers made the flashlight have an alternate weapon ability, basically you can bludgeon your enemy to death with it, but this also works better on paper. You're more likely to beat an Imp to death out of a panic attack rather than on purpose (it is possible..I did it during just such an attack) but it's certainly not recommended. Were there a way to put in night-vision I'd find that a whole lot better. The base layout is both brilliant and confusing at the same time. At no point during my playing of the game did I think ""Wow...I bet the employees never get lost here"". And my God, the hallways become extremely draining...there's so plagued many of them! You can go through an entire level and only ever see 4 rooms...the rest of it is an endless series of hallways. Why is every human character in the game bald? Why did UAC put so many hidden compartments in the walls? So many unanswered questions.

Still the game even finds time for a little humor too. For a good example of this view the ""Safety"" video from the Recycling Plant, which calmly explains that the two major dangerous byproducts of the refinery are steam ""which is pretty much vented everywhere"" and ""Green Goo"". That and the references to Human Resources (gotten from the room where you move the barrels around with the crane) had me splitting my sides, unexpected in a game like this.

Overall I give this baby 4 stars. A definite creep-out special that will have your skin crawling with each hiss of a steam pipe. In the near future I'm upgrading my machine, primarily to see what this game looks like when it's jacked up to maximum detail. If it's low detail look is any indicator I think I'll be in for a huge treat. Great game that will have you spooked out and begging for more!",I need...my....nitro pills...*gasp*

If you're a fan of on-rail shooters (not having to walk, the game guides you around, you just shoot) then you'll love this when like I love the house of the dead series (2&3 and Overkill). The only issue I had with this game is that a lot of it, is well, too dark. Not creepy/scary, which it kind of is, but the fact most of the game is DARK. You can adjust your TV settings all you want, but unless you find glowsticks in the game, you find yourself wondering where all these noises are coming from. Which I guess adds to the creepy aspect of the game, but I'm a gamer who likes to SEE all parts of the game and take in the sights. Other than the dark levels, which don't last forever - this game is great. The creatures are incredibly creative concepts, the weapons and the upgrading system keeps you hooked - and this game isn't just another Wii game Nintendo developers rushed along. I bought the ""New Super Mario Brothers"" and Dead Space extraction at the same time, and I own every Mario game - and I play Dead Space for more consecutive hours than Mario - and even my girl friend gets into this game (she doesn't play many games to say the least).

I hope you enjoy the game - but if this is one of your first ""on-rail"" or first person shooters for the Wii - I HIGHLY suggest you buy House of the Dead Overkill first. It's a much better game (if you can handle the swears that fly out of ""Samuel L. Jackson's"" mouth.",entertaining but dark game
B00002SVWG,4.0,"This is most definitely a much, much different game than the other entries in the Final Fantasy series.  You control the young hero, Ramza Beoulve, and a party of adventurers as they become involved in what starts out as a relatively simple case of kidnapping and politics that eventually turns into a crisis that involves a trip into the underworld to save the world from the forces of darkness.  Your party starts out as Ramza and a bunch of generic characters, but as you progress through the game you will meet up with a number of friends that will join your party, all of which have their own unique abilities, ranging from forgettable, to helpful, to awesomely-overpowering.
There are a lot of good things about this game.  There are a total of 20 ""jobs"" in the game, ranging from the usual things like Wizards, Healer-types, and sword-wielding Knights to exotic classes such as the Ninja, the Calculator, and those ever-popular Summoners.  Each character starts out as one of two ""generic"" classes, and as they level up and learn new abilities, more and more of the other classes are unlocked and become available.  Most of the battles you participate in allow you to take a party of five characters into action, although there are a few exceptions.  So, the possible combinations of battle parties one can create is almost endless.  The customization part of this game is probably its strongest point, because it allows for hours of fun experimentation as you learn the different jobs' strengths and weaknesses.  The battles themselves are somewhat like a giant chess match, where you and the computer manuever your men around a 3-D battlefield, trying to take and hold the most advantageous positions to use to your advantage.  One of the best things about all this is that you have to be careful how you use magic.  The high-level magic spells in this game can be quite powerful, but the player must learn how to use it properly, or else you will kill off your own group members in addition to the enemies.  There are many different types of battlefields, ranging from open prairies, to castles and dungeons, to swampland, and everything in between.  The story battles are filled with drama and danger, and the random battles you get into as you move from town to town will keep your skills maxed out, since the monsters in random battles level up along with you, so you will always be challenged, even when revisiting areas near the beginning of the game.  The in-game music and graphics are excellent, given that this game is several years old.  The shops in the game are where you will go to purchase the vast majority of your weapons, armor, and items, and there is a very well-done ""fitting room"" system to ensure that you know ahead of time what you are buying and what it will do for you before you spend money on it.  Once you have been through a few battles, money worries will rapidly fade.  It's also easy to keep plenty of items in stock so you never run out during battle.  There are also a number of sidequests, as we have come to expect from all Final Fantasy games, and they are rewarding, fun, and generally worthwhile.
There are a few flaws, though.  The plot of the game is rather... convoluted.  It's tough, very tough, to keep track of the dozens of cast members and who is on what side, who is betraying who, and so on.  There is a feature in the game allowing you to replay key scenes in the story, and also read biographies of all characters, and I found myself going back here often.  If you can keep up with everything, the plot is compelling, but it is tough.  The ending of the game is very sad and haunting, and won't soon be forgotten.  Another flaw is the rather poor Japanese-to-English translations that this game contains.  It doesn't really detract from the enjoyment of the game, but it is very jarring.
Despite these flaws, I really think that this game takes many of the well-known traditions of the Final Fantasy series to the next level.  Anyone who has played and enjoyed the other games in the series will enjoy this one.  I know I did.",Very good game

B000051QDD,4.0,"Bought this to install a HDD into the PS2 and install games to the HDD over a network. Only certain drives will work with the PS2 and I think 200GB is the most space it will recognize. There should be a compatibility list out there somewhere. Good if your PS2 games are on their last legs and you want to preserve a digital copy. PS2 games are dirt cheap and have been for a while, so if you missed out on some great imports/undiscovered gems, hit up a used game store after you pick up one of these and a compatible hard drive.

This only works in fat PS2s, and it might be hard to find one that is still in working order... PS2s are notorious for hardware failures.",You can Install Hard drive and put PS2 games on it with this
B00004TEXU,4.0,"If this game didn't have the name ""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater"" on it, I probably would have confused this for another skateboarding game. The game has almost no similarites to the first. Instead of tapes, you get money, with double the objectives and bigger levels. You have a whole bunch of different tricks, and you have to buy stats instead of just earn them, and you can buy new tricks. This game also has an create a player mode and a Skate Park Editor(Which I am a very big fan of), so you can make your own skate parks, and play and edit pre-made parks. The thing about this game is, even though it's bigger, and there are more tricks and it's easier to do combos, it's just not as fun. A big contribution to this is the disappointing soundtrack. The only good songs on it are the first two: Blood Brothers by Papa Roach and Anthrax with Public Enemy in Bring the Noise. The punk is all missing. It has been replaced with rap, which any skater is plain out against. Another thing is that while the beginning parks are bigger, they stay the same size through the whole game. The game also asks you to do impossible tasks, like grind rails you can't even find and get 250,000 points in two minutes in a level where it takes 10 seconds to get to the halfpipe(Philadelphia)! Another thing is some of the graphics. There is a lot of draw-in, especially on the narrow courses, and the characters look, well...dirty in appearance. It's kind of funny to look at them though. But despite of all this, the game's still fun. I don't know why, I should be giving this two stars, but knowing that it's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, I get the good ol' feeling. Buy it, I guess.",You'd barely recognize it...
B000EP3ZLC,4.0,"I just finished playing this game. There are so many plots and storylines and some are so far out there that i could't reall understand the whole thing. I still think part 1 was the best. The way this game ends makes you question if there will be a part 3. I hope so because i'm left hanging with a lot of questions. The scenery was great, mostly neighborhoods that were run down and rainy and winter or underground. The controls were cool but sometimes the camera angle got in your way when you are trying to fight someone. Unlike part 1, you can die in this one and i died at least 30 times but the game automatically saves b4 that is possible so you can try and try again. There were funny parts as well but i found this game more terrifying than part 1 lol. Some may find that as a good thing, for me i prefer more adventure safe game :) Overall i was eager to play it everyday after work so I still enjoyed it. the story though was too complicated for me lol so now im trying to find forums where it's explained better for me. If you you didn't play part 1, play that first or 2nd it's far better (but shorter). This game was surprisingly longer than part 1 which is good, i finished part 1 in a week this one took me a few weeks to finish and puzzles were fun to play.
BE CARFUL: I bought this game for my PC which is the same pc i played part 1 on, and it is not compatible so i had to buy the XBOX version and borrow an XBOX from a friend. Now i got this brand new PC game that i cant play. I'm quite dissapointed about that, my PC is not that old and is quite new and i was unhappy with the requirements for the game, which include very expensive video cards.

B0068INSUM,4.0,"I needed a smaller keyboard and regrettably had to give up my full-sized Rosewill. Finding a smaller keyboard with good keys was more of a challenge than I expected. I recognize that key feel is an individual thing and so won't dwell on the varieties of Cherry - this one is good for me. Other features - it has extendable feet to change the angle, which I am using as I write this review. It also has skid resistance pads that do a good job. It has a bright red warning light on the Caps Lock key, which can scare away wild animals circling your campfire. On the downside, it seems to me that the key placement is just a little closer together than my previous, full-sized keyboards, which leads me to occasionally not hit the center of the key. This may just be me, so I recommend trying the keyboard out prior to purchase in case it is a real problem for you. Otherwise, that's my only ""minus.""","A decent, smaller keyboard"
B00M9TD70K,4.0,"I really liked the first Assassin's Creed, and the second one was good, too, even though I absolutely hated Ezio and his stupid popped collar. From there, the games went downhill, and I did not enjoy them as much.  I was excited about the new Unity one, but its reviews were horrible, so I decided to try out the lesser known Rogue, and I actually liked it.

First, I'm going to say that my main problem with this game is too many cut scenes. I think UBI Soft started fancying itself as a movie maker instead of a game creator and began to put waaaaaay too many cut scenes in the AC games. Inserting so many cut scenes is the equivalent of an annoying sibling constantly grabbing your controller and screaming, ""Give it to me! I can play better than you!"" However, Rogue wasn't as bad as some, like Assassin's Creed III (I think it was) where it wouldn't even allow you to play the game until you're 30 minutes into it, but it still had too many.

Despite its cut scene failings, it was a pretty fun game. I'm not a picky gamer. If I have fun playing something, then I don't care if it's state-of-the-art graphics and so forth, but this game did have good graphics. UBI Soft does suck at character graphics, in my opinion. I can tell that they are trying to make their protagonists have those superhero cut jaws and cheekbones and rugged handsomeness, but they end up having weird lemon mouths and look like corpse puppets... but I digress. I thought the missions were fun for the most part, and I liked that you could sail a ship around in this one, too.

I think Rogue is better than the last couple. I would say it is a step in the right direction, but then there's Unity, so that statement is probably not accurate. It's only $15, though, so I would say it's a good game for that price.","Fun, low-key addition"

B00005O0I9,4.0,"Well my DVD/VCR combo gave up the ghost. It was almost 10 years old anyways. Also my upstairs DVD player went dead on me about the same time. I had bought it used many moons ago when DVD players where still going for $150. I don't really play video games now that im 37. Then it hit me, my old Xbox works as a DVD player and surprisingly i still remembered you needed this. Their was a reason this remote was needed. Microsoft was trying to recoup some money on offering DVD playback in its console. For fear off people not wanting to buy the Xbox because it lacked this feature they came up with this scheme. At the time DVD players where still going for about $125 for a cheap one. The kit at the time was $30, so Microsoft made about a $23 profit on this. Of course it was either that or buying a DVD player for $125. Anyways thankfully you can get this now for under $10. As i don't watch many movies as well it will do a job. Also i do have another Dvd player as well as my main unit.",Xbox 1 Dvd Playback
B001QXNBJM,4.0,"I bought this game for two primary reasons :-
1. I enjoyed the first Bad Company game
2. I was sorely disappointed with MW2.

So with that in mind how is this game?  to me the single player game isn't actually as good as the original Bad Company game.  It seems as though Dice has been looking at the Call of Duty games and tried to incorporate bits into their engine. The original Bad Company game had a fairly expansive battlefield that you could roam around on and do fairly much whatever you wished, whilst the game still pushed you towards your goals.
The battlefields in BC2 are a lot more restrictive. You don't seem to have the freedom you had in the original which was disappointing.
The single player game is also fairly short, taking roughly 6-7 hours to complete. It's also quite frustrating at times as you'll be playing along and suddenly there's a cut-scene. It takes the fluidity out of gameplay.  The cut-scenes however are very nicely rendered and do add to the storyline. There's also quite comical remarks as you'd expect if you played the original.
Single player however is still fun and takes you through the maps that you will be playing in the multi-player/online game so it's good familiarity to play the single player game first.
Dice however seem to have focused their attention on the multi-player game and they have done an excellent job with it. Lots of hours of fun can be spent playing the different types of multi-player games available, with more maps and add-ons coming in the next few months.
If you're looking for a good single player game that lasts a long time and that you will come back to, look elsewhere, there's better ones out there.
If you're looking for a combination of decent single player game but will spend more time online then I'd definately recommend this.

B00EN1IF7C,4.0,"Great game and way better than previous versions except for the fact there are less maps than the other games and that is the same for cars.  I don't care they got rid of some crappy cars, but also they did with some great cars like the tesla roadster.  Plus it was fun to race some basic cars like fords.  I was hopping laFerearri was going to be in the pack but it's not, may be some cars I can't remember at moment but other than 10 bucks for the new Ferrari and most others are crap cars, they are going to most likely do that for the other newer lambo sad well.

B000R39GGE,4.0,"This is a fun game and a great value.  By including two previously released games, updating the graphics, and adding additional content, this game was not only fun to play but also a terrific value.

If you have not played any of the previous Star Wars Lego games and enjoy action platformer types games this is a must buy.  The action is light, fun, and addictive.  There are some minor annoyances, the odd camera issue and some of the platforming aspects - controls could be a hair tighter - but these are generally minor annoyances.

To top it off, the game delivers goofball humor that is funny without being overly cheesy.  Combine the easy to approach action with secrets and collectibles not obtained on a first play through and you have a game that actually appeals to all ages with tons of replay value.

Finally, the Star Wars license has been put to good use. Easily the best Star Wars game on any Playstation platform.",Great value
B001EQPDO2,4.0,The amazing myan adventure was fun and my son and I played through it with the original DSphat.  Mystery P.I. on the other hand is a darker affair with trickier lighting on many of the touchscreen item find puzzles.

The gameplay is rock solid I prefer the noir detective feel of this game over the adventure tone of the original game but both are addictive ISPY item hunt fun in videogame form.

B00000I1BG,4.0,"...I found another ninja game called ""Tenchu: Stealth Assassin"". I read the back of it and it looked pretty good. When I tried it back at home, I was blown away! This game was really sweet. And after I tried the demo of ""Ninja: Shadow of Darkness"" that was in my game ""Fighting Force"", I realized I was lucky that I didn't waste my money on it.
I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in ""Devil May Cry"", it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.","Finally, a ninja game for Playstation!"

B00L2FGSBM,4.0,"This remote allows you to turn the xbox one on and off, navigate the basic menu's, and control media playback.  I use my XB1 as a blu ray player, and its annoying to go to pause a movie and see that the controller has powered off.  I have a media remote for my 360 and PS3, so I figured I'd get one for the XB1 for non gaming purposes.

It fits in the palm of your hand and all buttons are within a thumbs reach.  Its not beautifully crafted from the finest Corinthian leather, its just inexpensive plastic.  It is an infrared remote so it has to be pointed at the xbox.  Xbox one controllers use wireless and this is different from that, so range and where you point matters.  I've found it reaches about 12' with a new pair of AAA batteries, which were not included.

Controlling the tv?  There aren't any facilities to train the remote, so I believe the tv control part works only if you have a Kinect, which the Xbox one uses to control channel and volume on a tv.  You'd press a button on the remote, the XB1 would see it and tell the Kinect to send an IR signal to the tv and that's probably how that works.  I don't have a kinect so I can't test it right now.

I found the buttons worked pretty much all the time and didn't require any special effort to work.  I've also seen the 'real' microsoft remote and it doesn't seem any fancier or better working than this one, but the 'real' one costs a lot more.

So if you want a cheap remote to basically hit pause and play and turn the XB1 on and off, this is well recommended.  I don't think I'd try to play Halo with it, but maybe that'd be a special challenge",Fine media remote for Xbox One
B0002A6CQ4,4.0,"This game looks, sounds and plays fantastic.  So you ask why my 3 & 4 stars well it's simply because I'm not an ace shooter and the fact that there weren't options for easy/normal/hard mode for this game made me feel as if I'd lost IQ points because I stank at it.  This game was amazing as far as changing the resident evil formula making the bad guys more challenging, etc.  But if you aren't an expert gamer this game is going to be more frustrating than the scary stay up for hours game play of old.  After 3 or 4 deaths I was ready to throw in the towel for this game it simply was too hard for me.  I'm sure other reviewers will get a good laugh about that, but I like choices with my game.  I want to be able to play on the Easy version before kicking up to speed demon mode.

As I said though I think they made amazing strides with RE4 although the story really has nothing to do with RE's umbrella corp storyline, the horror aspect was still there.  Now instead of just having zombies that can bite you you have actual enemies who come at you with weapons and don't stay down once you've shot them.

I love the fact that the Gamecube gives them more opportunity for amazing graphics.  I hate to admit I hope this is available on PS2 with a few options that I can choose from like Easy/Normal/Or Crazy mode and even better cheat options so players like me can actually enjoy the game all the way through even though we stink at it.

For gamers with the skill this is a great adventure and challenging shooter, but if you aren't that quick on the draw you might want to wait and see if they come out with a PS2 version with some options.  But you still should check it out for yourself because it is worth it.",Give me a few options please

B0015HYPOO,4.0,"It's my second steering wheel after the one I was using with my Atari ST. Or was it the C-64? It makes playing games such as GT5-Prologue a lot more fun than playing them with the 'regular' PS3 controllers. For the more arcade-like games, I don't know. I see that my kids prefer the six-axis, probably because they are light and wireless.

Let me list my biggest complains first:

- WIRES: there's a wire from the wheel to the power brick, then a wire from the power brick to the electric outlet. Then, you have a wire from the pedals platform to the wheel body. Then, there's a wire from the wheel to the PS3. I wish that 2 of these were replaced by 'wireless'.
- THE WHEEL BOOTUP: whenever you start your PS3 or your game, the wheel initializes itself but quickly turning right and left. The moves have so much force, they COULD injure a little kid's arm if it happened to be caught by the wheel moving.
- GRIP TO TABLE: it's not TOO BAD but, from time to time, the wheel goes off whatever platform you attach it to.
- GRIP TO FLOOR: there is some rough thing at the bottom that does prevent the pedals platform from slipping and moving but it's not perfect.

What I appreciated the most:

- CONTROL: it's perfect. It's well calibrated, balanced and precise.
- RUMBLING/SHAKING/VIBRATING: this is AWESOME. On GT5 you can FEEL the road, you feel the bumps and you must fight the wheel when taking high speed turns.
- OVERALL CONSTRUCTION: it feels solid, well-manufactured, durable.

Things lacking that I don't miss but some might:

- NO CLUTCH PEDAL: it's not there
- THE STICK: shifting is not exactly imitating life. You basically move it up to move into a higher gear and down to go to the lower gear. That's it.

Why do I give it 4 stars and no 3? BECAUSE IT'S FUN! Well worth the price - and it's coming from someone who tends to avoid Logitech stuff (long story).

My next purchase should be one of them driving seats. That would take care of some of my biggest issues I have with the wheel in its present setup - attached to a coffee table.",Great with GT5 (prologue) but... so many wires...
B00005A775,4.0,"This game is fun if you grew up playing older games on Genesis or Saturn,which I both own. These games are almost the same as the originals except for the sound It does not sound good at all. Other than the sound the game is pretty good because of the price I paid only $10 and their is 12 games so I think its great. I didn't think some games should not of been on here like Wrestle War and Altered Beast,they are not fun to play. On the other hand, Sonic the hedgehog,Golden Axe,Vectorman,and Streets of Rage 2 were true classics that were still awesome to this day.

B0017KGG0K,4.0,"Yes! What a great guitar hero game. So what are the games problems? I didn't give it a 5 so it must have problems right? Well there is no donwloadble content. You are stuck with the songs you get on this disc. Also, the song features less songs than guitar hero 3 and 2. Now what makes this game so good. Lot's of aerosmith songs! Many people have complained about how there are so many older songs on this disc. The majority of the aerosmith songs are songs that are most likely before your time and before their 90's era when they were so well known. BUT this does not make those old 70's songs on this disc no good. Just because you haven't heard it before does not mean you can't enjoy it.

 There is just too much complaining from people who claim to be aerosmith fans, because they never heard of so many of these songs. Here is a hint guys, if you truly are an aerosmith fan you will learn to appreciate and enjoy many of these older songs. If it wasn't for early aerosmith you wouldn't have 90's aerosmith. Catch my drift?

  Another complaint about the game has been it's difficulty, but truthfully this could be a good thing. I was dissapointed of the extreme difficulty of Guitar Hero 3 on expert. If you feel the same way as I do, you will actually appreciate the easier difficulty. Even though the songs may be easier to pass, they are not easier to full combo and sometimes 5 star on expert. So once you beat this game on expert, if you are like me, you will continue playing until you 5 star everything and then move onto trying to full combo everything(good luck with that, some of these songs are insane).

 This game is good. Many critics have heavily criticized the game for it's lack of content and it's lack of well known Aerosmith songs. Blah, blah. If you appreciate the music of Aerosmith, you WILL fall in love with this game despite the game's flaws.",Woo Hoo!

B00004U1IO,4.0,"Let's just get straight to the heart of the matter with this game... Koudelka's most common criticism was the speed of its turn based battle system.  Admittedly, the battle system is unnecessarily slow.  (However, that is buffered by a low encounter rate.)  For those who have patience for the lethargy, they will be rewarded with one of the most unique JRPGs ever developed.  Primarily Koudelka's mature characters and plot are extremely unique and enjoyable (no we-can-save-the-world teenagers here).  That is if you can deal with a heavy dose of the macabre.  Koudelka's plot contains subject matter that is entirely adult (suicide, murder, child abuse, child prostitution, for starters), and the gore factor can be high at times.  These elements are made believable thanks to excellent voice acting and FMV that holds up well for its age.  Further strengths are creative and diverse enemy variety, fantastic atmosphere, and a protagonist you will find endearing by the end.  My only complaints are the brain dead simple puzzles and weak OST.  This game's composer is world renowned but he utterly dropped the ball with Koudelka's quirky but ill-fitting soundtrack.  Well if you are an open minded player with patience, give Koudelka  a shot.  It might not be a masterpiece, but it's an innovative and completely unique experiment that I doubt we'll ever see attempted again.  Koudelka billed itself as a survival horror RPG, and it delivered exactly that.",Patience shall reward explorers of this darkness.
B0050SX7BQ,4.0,"I LOVED Heavy Rain so of course I bought this right away when it came out. The story was compelling and the interface works better than Heavy Rain. At the end of the day, I still like Heavy Rain more. This game has a pretty satisfying set of endings though. Bottom line, if you liked Heavy Rain, you will like this game.",Great game but really a play only once kind of game
B000G80MKO,4.0,"Venetica plays as sort of an interactive story.  It is somewhat linear.  You can move around a bit but can't get to the next area until you complete the relevant part of the main quest.  You can return to previously explored areas though, and enemies respawn if you go out at night so areas aren't ""dead"" after clearing them.

The rpg aspects in V. are not as developed to the extent of a game like Oblivion for example.  You can only play the one character and there is no customization available.  There are four attributes and the skills are not extensive in number.  Optional, side quests are a bit limited in number.  On the other hand, you have to find trainers to improve your skills and armor has to be ""fitted"" by a blacksmith before you can wear it.  Those are nice features that add to the sense of realism.

The combat took some time to get used to but was ultimately o.k.  If you time your hits correctly you can put together a string of different attack moves.  Also you need to use the ""roll"" action to dodge enemy attacks and set up your own attacks.  It was an interesting idea to design the game so that different weapon types were more effective depending on the enemy.  The problem comes in setting your hot keys for the special attacks.  Each of the four weapon types had its own special skill moves.  Even the ""block"" function (default right mouse button) was a separate skill for each weapon type.  I ended up having to pause and reset the hot keys every time I switched weapons.  It would have been a lot smoother if there was a separate row of hot keys for each weapon type (plus one for when no weapon was drawn).  The display could then automatically switch depending on what you were holding.

Cons:
  Voice audio stuttered a few times.
  Voice acting of generic characters was very repetitive. (Oh!  Hello!)
  Sometimes the background sound effects (like a fountain) were so loud that you couldn't hear the dialogue.
  Some quest map markers were not accurate.
  Could have used more humor.
  Would have like some diversions - gambling or skill games.
  Unlimited weight - you could literally carry tons of loot.  At least have a magic bag of holding to explain it.

Pros:
  Installation was easy.  Insert disc, install, play.  No STEAM, no online registration, etc.
  Very stable.  I had only one crash in many hours of play.
  Nice graphics - a beautiful setting.
  Good voice acting for the main characters.
  Good sound effects.  (I loved the sound of boots on boardwalks)
  By revealing new areas one at a time the game was kept interesting throughout.
  Economics were well handled.  Magic items were limited (so remained special) and you never had more money than you could use.
  Difficulty level could be switched midgame.  (if you had trouble getting past a big boss for instance)

Overall:

I would recommend Venetica to any RPG fan or even a more action oriented player.  The setting was a nice change of pace from the typical medieval gothic.  I wish more game companies would be willing to try games with different themes.  Back in the pencil and paper age of RPG's there were games for just about any period you could think of.

How about a western? (think Paladin)  Ancient Rome? (slaves, gladiators, barbarians)
Three Musketeers?  If you feel you have to have fantasy elements then how about ancient mythological Greece?  Or feudal Japan with mythological elements?  Or Sinbad/Arabian Nights?  There are all sorts of themes that haven't been explored by the game designers.

I personally don't think you need a messianic main story (as does Venetica and most every RPG I've played) to have a good game.  Say you were 6 years old and playing in the woods when bandits came through your village and killed your family and neighbors.  Now you are 16 and set out to make your way in the world (and get revenge against the bandits who by now have split up into separate gangs).  It could be as simple as that.  If you have a good combat system (Mount & Blade for example), a good inventory and economics system, and a large area to explore sandbox style, you would have a fun game.  The real enjoyment of a good RPG is starting out poor and weak and gradually becoming more skilled and knowledgeable.  It is about the journey, not the destination.  (just like real life)","Action/Adventure/RPG - Single Player, 3rd Person Perspective"
B00EM5UFEK,4.0,OK game. Too expensive.,Four Stars
B000X2RKOO,4.0,"I bought the gun because it has so many good reviews, and while I don't necessarily disagree with them, it was only once I made some modifications to the gun that it held up and deserved 5 stars.  Just to recap what I did to make this gun outstanding:  First off, the fact that it was necessary to remove the wrist strap was annoying, so right at the back of the channel where the wiimote fits in, I drilled a 1/2"" hole in the side of the gun so that I could just feed the strap through there. Nyko should have thought of this.  Second of all, I found that my hand was extremely tired very quickly while using this with HOTD: Overkill, and I quickly realized it was due to the gun being so front heavy, requiring me to put a deathgrip on the handle. This was easily remedied by opening up the handle by pulling off the blue cover on the one side, and then sliding some stacks of pennies wrapped in electrical tape in the handle to weigh it down.  This balances the gun perfectly and relaxes my hand a bit while playing. Overall, once I made these mods, it is a 5 star gun, but because i had to do them myself (although very simple) it is only deserving of 4 stars now. Nyko had a good start, but didn't quite finish the job.","Great accessory, once you modify it a bit"

B0010EF0UK,4.0,This game is seriously addicting. I originally bought this game for nephews and I found myself to be a closet Patapon freak who has to play when I get home from work and before bed. It is a simple rhythm based game that uses 4 bottoms to control the little army of whimsical one eye warriors. In only a couple days of playing I have played this game more than any of my other PSP games. For the less than $20 the game is well worth the purchase and I would recommend it to anyone who just a whimsical style game almost like a Tim Burton movie.,Pata Pata Pata Crack =)
B00B67ZS3U,4.0,"Great game, but lacks replay value. Great for going through 1-2 times and then boxing up for later.",Four Stars
B0028IBTLG,4.0,"I find the number of one star reviews here to be absolutely absurd.  Is the game buggy?  Yes.  Does is deserve a one star rating because of this?  Of course not.  The one star reviews are purely and simply an overreaction.  I took a star off my overall rating because of the bugs, but I have found this game to be a huge amount of fun.  I have played all the Fallout games since the initial offering a decade ago.  ALL of the games in this series have been incredibly buggy.  Fallout 2 on the PC was absolutely unplayable until they released a patch.  But even then I found the games to be fun.  And Fallout New Vegas may be the one I've had the most fun with yet.

I will acknowledge that the game has flaws.  I have a somewhat older 40 GB PS3.  I don't know if it would play more smoothly with one of the newer ones with their larger drives.  The game locks fairly frequently.  Sometimes I can play for five hours straight with no problems.  Sometimes the game locks up on me 4 or 5 times in two hours.  Many of the initial problems with the game - the lack of 12.7mm ammo, the absence of the Gun Runners character, a number of quests that you couldn't complete - were fixed by the first patch, but many other problems remain.  When I go to Camp Forlorn Hope, the game almost always locks up on me or experiences enormous lag.

But all in all I find this game to be a staggering amount of fun.  There is an unbelievable amount of content, more even than the initial release of Fallout 3.  On my fifth way through the game I'm discovering a huge number of major quests.  I'm sure that there are even more that I haven't accessed because I've always killed the Legion on sight (just can't associate with slavers, even in the context of a make believe game).  The companion characters are really effective fighters (so much so that if you give them good weapons they can challenge you for the kills a lot of the time, though I find ED-E to be fairly lame (corrected by replacing him with Rex the Cyberdog - if you give him Violetta's brain he is so fast he will tank for you better than any companion I've had in any of the Fallout games - and it is pretty close to impossible to knock out).  The game allows a number of different very different playing styles, none of them nerfed.  My daughter prefers playing a Melee character and finds that she can do well against most baddies (the Deathclaws being a bit of a challenge).  I play a pure sniper character, taking all of the perks for shooting very far away.  The first two times I played the game through I did so using a Sniper Rifle with silencer, but then I discovered the super modified gauss rifle that is dropped by a character on the far northeast part of the map (go to the abandoned farm on the upper left, and then go just a bit to the northeast - when you find a way of going up over the cliff face that blocks all access to the north go up it and continue east - the character with the modified gauss is at a camp site).  This weapon, the YCS/186, uses four microfusion cells with each shot and has to reload after each shot (if you want this weapon, it is good to take the rapid reload perk) and will, if you use the max damage microfusion cells and take all the appropriate perks, provide almost 800 DPS.  Except for the Fat Boy (which has limited ammo), this is the most powerful weapon in the game that I've discovered so far (I didn't take the Wild West perk - if you do you get an Alien Blaster at the same spot - I don't know how powerful that is, but as in Fallout 3 there is limited ammo, while the YCS/186 uses microfusion cells).  Plus it has a great scope and allows you to shoot at absurdly long distances.  You can use it to one hit deathclaws (I managed a long distance one shot to the head of the Alpha Deathclaw when clearing out the quarry) or anything else in the game.  In fact, the weapon is so powerful that it almost makes the game boring.

I love the map and most of the quests.  The various factions are cool and I like that there are some major differences between one group and another.  I like that civilization is a little less ragged than in Fallout 3.  And the companion characters are all fun.  Many are voiced by well known actors - Felicia Day voices a melee character (the character truly sucks with guns, so let her go melee) who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, Zachary Levi plays a character with significant medical skills, Danny Trejo voices a ghoul character, while Mr. New Vegas, a radio DJ, is played by Wayne Newton).

I've had a problem with computer games.  I played World of Warcraft for a year after it came out and played Asheron's Call for several years before that.  I found the utterly immersive world that they provided to be addicting.  I spent thousands of hours playing them, thousands of hours that I could have used doing other things.  While they were endless fun, I was achieving none of the life goals I'd set for myself.  I have found that the three games based on Bethesda's game engine - Oblivion, Fallout 3, and New Vegas - to provide much of the same experience of playing in a massive gaming universe, while not taking significant chunks of my life.  I'd love to play WoW again, but after leaving online gaming I've published a number of essays and articles (and am working on a book on which I've made great progress) that I never would have been able to write if I were still gaming.  Fallout New Vegas provides a lot of the same joy that I got playing WoW without making me sacrifice all the things that give me satisfaction in life.  Yes, the game has bugs, but it is also the PS3 game that I've enjoyed more than any other.  Hopefully they'll release another patch that makes the game play more smoothly, but even with the warts it is immensely entertaining.",Buggy - but still an enormous amount of fun

B000JLL3UQ,4.0,"Phoenix Wright is back in the second installment of this court room drama series.  Reviewing this is fairly simple - if you have played the first one, you know exactly what you are getting.  If you haven't played the first one - why are you reading this, go buy Phoenix Wright:  Ace Attorney and play that first :).  This sequel follows a virtually identical format to the original - you are a defense attorney that must gather evidence and defend your client in a murder trial.  The fact that this game is so close to the original is good and bad.  If you liked the first, you are almost certain to like the sequel - again, they are virtually identical.  The bad - none of the drawbacks to the first game have been addressed which makes them even more of a headache this time around.

The game itself has its pluses.  The characters are truly charming, fun to interact with, and have well developed personalities.  There were several times I found myself being sucked into the conversations and trying to psycho-analyze the characters.  The game play is unique and addictive, especially for fans of court room and/or police dramas.  Finally, Capcom did add the Psyche-Lock feature for this game to help spice things up.  The Psyche-Lock basically works a ""mini-trial"" during the investigation phase.  You will need to present evidence to get a character to spill the beans on a secret they are keeping.  This feature is probably going to be hit-or-miss for gamers - I found it to be fun, but I can see how some would find it repetitious and tedious after a while.

There are several flaws in this game.  First, suspending your disbelief in the courtroom portion of this game is near impossible at certain points.  The prosecution will present 2 or 3 witnesses and various pieces of evidence that you will shred to pieces only to have the prosecutor say something like, ""yeah, but can you explain [insert some random point],"" and the judge will respond with, ""that's true, if you can't explain that, then I have no choice but to find your client guilty.""  Despite the fact that the prosecutor no longer has any evidence or witnesses to support its case, your client will be toast if you can't argue that one minor detail.  It would not be so annoying if didn't happen like 3 or 4 times every case.  In addition, the game is really unforgiving when it comes to presenting evidence.  You will be given several pieces of evidence in each case.  In some instances different pieces of evidence will be related to each other.  If you don't happen to present the exact right piece (at the exact right moment) you will be zapped.  Making matters even worse is that there are times that you will really have no clue what the game wants you to present (a much more pronounced problem than it was in the original).

There are only four cases in this installment of the game.  I won't spoil the cases, but I truly loved one and found one to be so convoluted that it was torture to continue (the other 2 were both decent).  My only gripe on the cases would be that part of the charm of the Ace Attorney was figuring out which of the half dozen characters introduced in each story was the ""true"" murderer.  In this Justice for All, several characters are brought back and since you know them from the first time around, you can scratch them off the suspect list right away leaving only 1 or 2 possibilities as the true culprit.

I do not want to give the impression that this is a horrible game.  It's a fun DS game that I would recommend to anybody, but be prepared for some very frustrating moments.  One final point, this game is not for younger children - there are several mature subject matter moments.",A fun (but flawed) game

B0013OM528,4.0,"As with all my consoles, I tend to stray as far away from ""composite"" cables.
If you're not sure what composite cables are, chances are you've used them and they're ""yellow, red and white"". The yellow outputs video while the red and white deliver audio. On a normal TV, the Av cables are great and perform exactly as intended. Composite cables make 480i possible and look considerably better than an RF connection. (which is the absolute worst in quality)

Anyway, onto the product review.

While most will think along the lines of ""I'm going to get a better picture"" on an HDTV, I will be the first to say you're wrong. Simply put, these cables will output ""progressive scan"" (480p) for games that support progressive scan. In fact, they offer no enhancements whatsoever for ""non-480p"" games.
These cables do not even offer a better version of 480i (unlike the gamecube and xbox which actually look better with component cables even if the game doesn't support it); and this would attribute to the fact that the PS2's resolution is considerably lower than most consoles.
With that said, for games such as God of War 1, the difference on an HDTV while offering a more crisp image will also show ""jaggies"" much more than a PS2 on a normal TV. Granted, the color is much deeper, the resolution is suitable and the cables pull off progressive scan rather nicely. I will say that I notice a very slight difference as far as the picture not being as fuzzy with av cables; but ps2 component cables look about on par with S-video cables.

These cables will also work with a PS3; and do a great job.

Bottom line, at about 4 dollars (with shipping) you couldn't go wrong purchasing these cables. The fact that they're compatible with both the ps2 and ps3 is a plus. Just don't expect too much of a difference on an HDTV with these cables unless the TV's smaller.",Don't expect much for HDTV

The multiplayer is also pretty fun but there aren't many modes to play and you can only have four total shooters at a time(computer and people).  The downsides of the game aren't noticeable right away, but you will know what I'm talking about after playing the game awhile. The controls are a bit odd and takes awhile to get used to it. Also the way your gun shoots is odd. You can see the bullets going almost like they are in slow motion.

B00006418I,4.0,"When I first got the gamecube and logged onto Nintendo.com for more information, I received an outline for a new type of controller. A ""wavebird"" it was called. It was not until later did I find it was wireless.
The wavebird is amazing. It fits just like you normally hold a gamecube controller. The range is incredible. The box says 20, but the controller goes 30, 50, and people have claimed even 100 feet sometimes. It comes with batteries, which is good because you will want to use it right away.
IT has 16 radio frequincies, which can be annoying. You need to rotate the dial on the controller until it matches with the same position as the base and input of the radio signals. We'll take off -0.5 for that.
The other problem is the no rumble. I understand the batteries get in the way of it, but it still would have been nice. We'll take off another -0.5 for that

B00002SU5C,4.0,"I can't take Star Trek.  I used to love it, but I try to watch it now, and...no.  Can't do it.  I liked the original series, and Next Generation was pretty good for a while, but after Roddenberry died, everything fell apart.  Deep Space Nine is just a badly disguised clone of Babylon 5.  Voyager was boring, uninspired, repetitive, and flatter than a piece of paper.  It should've been cancelled years ago.  Enterprise?  Please.  Even the UPN executives couldn't keep that thing going.

So, why am I here, giving a Star Trek game a good review?  Simple; because it's everything the shows and movies stopped being a long time ago:

It's exciting.  It's thrilling.  It's challenging.  It makes you think.  The people in it are actual PEOPLE, not a bunch of cardboard cutouts in black pajamas and weird makeup trying to advance the useless plot.  And above all, you never ONCE hear anyone say anything remotely like ""Modify the subspace harmonic phase variance yada yada yada...""  If I never hear that weak plot device crap again, it'll be too soon.  Not only that, it has things and concepts in it that not only make you think, ""Yeah, they SHOULD have something like that,"" it'll also make you say, ""Why didn't they EVER have that?""

The idea behind the game is this.  Since Voyager (grr...)is on the far side of the galaxy, far away from any backup, Janeway and Tuvok develop a new kind of away team.  This new unit, called the Hazard Team, is made up of special forces crewmen assembled to take on challenging missions that regulars can't handle, like a SWAT team compared to regular police.  The team's just been created when Voyager (rr...) gets sucked into a mysterious region of space and immobilized.  You play as Ensign Alex (or Alexandria...how PC) Munro, the Hazard Team's second-in-command.  And during the game, you'll have run-ins with mysterious aliens, hostile scavengers, the Borg, and a new race created only for this game.

Raven Software did a great job on this game.  The environments are bigger than what you'd expect from the TV shows, the aliens are more imaginative, the weapons are much more impressive and realistic, and the combat is gripping in some parts, especially when you're facing a stampede of Borg.  Your teammates all have their own personalities and functions, and the patter between them is actually worth listening to.  They're even FUNNY when they tell JOKES.  Who knew?

Unfortunately, the game does fizzle in a few places.  It uses the same ""sound as wallpaper"" approach to background music, so there isn't a single nanosecond that isn't drenched in bland New Age elevator muzak.  Some of the weapons don't have convincing sounds, like the Tetryon Gatling Gun; you'd think it was shooting soap bubbles.  Not only that, but you're limited to only two types of ammunition for eight different weapons, so if you run out of one of those two, half your arsenal's kaput.  And worst of all, at some points, you have to LISTEN to the boring regular VOYAGER cast members while they spout off about unimportant crap.  That one's easy enough to fix, though, if you do what I do; turn the sound off and wait it out.

I know I should end this review with something inspiring, like how in the right hands, even a lump of coal can shine like a diamond, but I've got nothing.

But it IS a lot more fun and entertaining than Star Trek's been for at least fifteen years, and that ain't bad, either.","For once, Star Trek DOESN'T suck horse apples."

The Bad: Some controllers seem to be defective at a higher rate than what should be acceptable. The bumpers break after regular use despite never being mishandled or used with excessive force.

I own two and one broke after around a year, the other has been fine despite nearly identical play times and usage. The extended warranty may not be a bad option.","Good controller, hope you get a good one"

B00005NZ1G,4.0,"Let me explain my title. I'm am a huge fps fan. I own Red faction 2, XIII, Tribes, Unreal tournament and alot more. Those are all great games and anyone should try them out. But back to Halo. Let's start with the story. Pretty basic, you fight aliens with your team of humans (which by the way you can't command in any way). The aliens are attacking you and you attack the aliens (the aliens are some of the best I've seen since Half Life, the grunts are so funny and the elites are so cool).
Now to the gameplay. Its the normal first person shooter stuff. You run and gun, nothing much more than any other game.
I have to say the voicing is good. There are really no corny lines. It is some of the best I've ever seen too.
Now to Master Chief's abilities. He's a super cyborg guy, that can only hold 2 guns at a time. He can't jump very high, and can't land large falls without hurting himself. But he can take alot of hits and keep on killing.
Now how about I go onto the so called best aspect of the game, the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very defined. It is some of the best I have seen in a while. The levels are rich in design and character. The only real complaints I have on it are that there are no bots, only 2 vehicle levels, and not many levels. By the way Hand em' High is the best. Finally to the thing that makes up every good fps, the weapons. I have to admit, this is one aspect I hope they fix in Halo 2. Yeah we've seen it all before, pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, I'm tired of the ordinary. Bungie, give us something new. Or at least add 5 types of assault rifles and like 3 kinds of rocket launchers ect. But all in all Halo is a great shoot em' up and it has a fun mulitplayer and an average single player. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention the co-op mode. It is fun and I like it, but why only two player? Hello, Microsoft, the Xbox has 4 control ports, how about we use them all? But, if you have an Xbox you should by all means pick this title up.",Average first person shooter.

B009AGXH64,4.0,"UPDATE:
I received a new console from Nintendo 1 week after I sent it. I have had it for 3 months and everything works perfectly. In fact, I am writing this on it.

The Wii U is a great console. The setup was nice and easy. I actually managed to get the last one in all of the Gamestops in my area.

I turned on the console, and went quickly through the setup process. Then came the long day one update. It lasted me 1 1/2 hours, but it wasn't that bad. The update finished , and I got on the main menu.

The menu is easy to navigate on the Gamepad, and just awesome looking on the TV. I started by running the mini-updates on all of the apps, which each one took about two minutes. Then, I went and tried out every app. Loading times aren't terrific, but it isn't really a big problem. Nintendo announced that they are going to release an update to quicken up loading times.

The console has great graphics. I used it for streaming Amazon Instant Video, and it streamed in HD with no problem and no lag. The Gamepad also had great graphics. It is also very light and comfortable to hold.

The console worked amazingly until the fourth day. Then, I started getting the blinking red light of death. I tried resetting the adapter many times, but with no luck. Once, it got working, but it froze five minutes into gameplay, and wouldn't turn on again. I called Nintendo customer support, and they told me my console needs to be fixed, so I shipped it out, and am still waiting to get it back. Their customer service is great though. They picked up within a minute, and they gave me $10 eshop credit for having this trouble. But if you are worrying if your console won't work, THIS IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM.

Overall, I was very impressed with this console while it worked. I would highly reccomend getting this console. It is great for single player and multiplayer use. When compared with the Xbox 360 and the PS3, this console easily comes out on top.","Great console, mine had a bug."
B01GU2V4SI,4.0,"***This is my original review for the game but I also purchased a copy of the Gold Edition because Target had a killer deal on it but the additional content isn't worth it. The Season Pass content may be worth it over time but initially, I'm unimpressed by what I got for $40 more. However I didn't change my 4 star review and you can read why below.

For Honor is here and after numerous opportunities to play the game early, the release copy is here. I picked up For Honor with a little bit of skepticism as to how it would keep me entertained with the heavy focus on multiplayer but I was very surprised.

Positives:
-The multiplayer is well established and with a handful of modes across more than a dozen maps, I'm enthused. I also like the very similar set up to Rainbow Six Siege with the different classes and characters

-The currency and packs to buy with the currency are surprising addictive in the age of this kind of mechanic (Gears of War, Battlefield 1, etc.). Being able to use these items to make my character look different or break down the item to construct something different is a nice addition

-The story has surprised me and though I haven't dived too deep into it, I'm optimistic about it. Honestly, Ubisoft adding any story support at all is a plus in my book and they could have made this just a multiplayer game and walked away.

-Gameplay and environments feel like they have been fleshed out and worked on over the course of the preview periods. Though I'll have more to say in the list below, I especially tip my hat to the environments and wanting to look around the world so bad but remember that people are hunting me down.

Negatives:

While this list is shorter (hence the 4 Star rating) these drawbacks really get to me personally. Repetition starts to naw away at me while playing this game. Though I love the environments, the dueling system is how you are successful and you have to use all the mechanics you are taught in this tutorial. So often I want to just run in and start swinging but I have to remember that I need to be calculated in my attack. To some this is perfect, to others it can keep you from wanting to start another game.

-This is more so a warning then a true negative but if your team isn't playing together or you aren't playing with a friend, success isn't always easy. If you find yourself with two player enemies coming at you, you probably won't win. It can get disheartening but if you have a friend, get the game and work together.

****I try to recommend games in my reviews and a good game to check out is Rainbow Six: Siege. Though it isn't in this time period, the multiplayer, customization and setup will feel very similar in a game that has a great online community. Rainbow Six is coming out with a ""Season 2"" batch of content and is surprising many gamers with all the support. Consider checking it out if you enjoy first person shooters but wish people would take them more seriously (breach and clear, moving slow and calculated).

Overall, I commend Ubisoft for making a different type of game and if you have read some of my reviews, that is huge for me. When developers and publishers take risks and make new IP's (Intellectual Property. New games; New concepts; Not based on anything else) I respect that. For Honor puts me in a different time period and forces me to work together with my teammates. It also gives me something to do on my own and seems like it will get the support it needs to stay alive for some time.

I hope you grab a copy! Let me know what you think below!",For Honor Is Intense and Addicting

B0000A1VEQ,4.0,"This game DOES work on windows 7, but what a journey I went on to find that out. I bought this game from amazon, it loaded but didn't play. Then just recently I found this game in Target. It was DVD (not CD-Rom) and it says it was compatible with windows 7! The only thing is you'd have to buy that one, because this one is cd-rom (maybe soon they will get the newer version on amazon). Besides that, I really liked this game. If your a fan of the longest journey, I recommend this game. The only thing I didn't like was the save feature. You have to be near a certain disc machine in the game to save. This machine turns up alot, but not on every single place you happen to be. Also the keyboard manuevering hurt my arm after awhile in making the character walk and ride the boat/raft.

B00DEL3IIS,4.0,"The Division is an interesting game. I'm a few days into it and I don't ""love"" it, but I do like it. To really get the feel of it you have to play it until you're a few levels up. You don't even get to the main title screen and cut scene that explains why you're working for The Division until your at level 2 or 3. The game teaches you as you go along, and there's plenty to learn. There's a good number menus and sub-menus to learn how to navigate, gear to equip and sell, weapons to use and special attributes to use.

Besides your usual load-out, there are skills you can unlock and set for use that you use to get you through missions. Some are medic type skills, healing yourself, your team mates and using a type of vision pulse that lets you see where enemies are located even when they are hiding behind cover. There also skills for doing damage and skills for added protection. Since I find myself constantly in need of health packs and you can only carry so many, I have been using just the medical skills. But the idea is that when you play as a team in co-op, each player having a different skill then helps the group as a whole.

As you play, you can choose whether to allow the game's matchmaking to let you do missions with other people, you can invite your own friends, or you can go solo. I've gone solo much of the time so far, using matchmaking a few times. Since the game has just been released and only one of my friends I plan to play in the Dark Zone has it yet, I haven't ventured there. The Dark Zone is a mix of game enemies and other real players. If you run into a group of unfriendly real player and you're going at it solo, you could end up losing all your loot. So I'm waiting until I have a full group to go in with! However there is a stash available to you in your house, so you can use that for anything you don't want to carry with you.

With this game you have to spend a good bit of time right off the bat learning so much about your environment, your safe house and how to upgrade and use areas of it, where find different missions, how to team up with other people and how to use your skills and gear, that the Dark Zone ends up being the last thing you check out. It takes time to just get your safe-house up and running, since you have to do missions to get different allies to help you get it going. The Dark Zone is more of the end-game experience. Once you've gone through the main missions and the story, then you start grinding for new loot in the Dark Zone.

I love open world games, and the post apocalyptic version of NYC in The Division is no exception. But unlike games like Fallout 4 which is a mix of city and nature, this is all urban city environment. It reminds me a lot of the original Infamous game. A city filled with missions and side-missions, and certain sections of the city being more difficult, so needing to level up before going there. The game's environment also reminds me of Infamous in that most of the civilians in the city are sick, hungry or dying.

In The Division, it's winter and there's Christmas lights lit up throughout the populated areas of the city. One thing nice to see was that the city didn't look the same everywhere you go. In open world games set in the city like Infamous, some areas are just clones of other areas, just adding a different color to the buildings or a different billboard. While playing The Division, I don't feel like I'm looking at the same buildings over and over. And I do love that it's set in the winter and there's a Christmas theme going on. Randomly you'll come across beautifully lit Christmas trees or holiday gift displays in store windows.

There's a lot to this game. So much that even after I've put several days into playing it, I'm constantly feeling like I'm still learning it all. This isn't the kind of game you can play for an hour and feel like you've figured it all out. I can't really compare it to any other game exactly. It has similarities to some, but nothing at all just like it. Lots to explore and will keep you playing for a while.",Will keep you coming back to play more
B00166N6SA,4.0,"The Sims 3 is a really great game. I'm surprised at it's low ratings on Amazon. Sims games usually get at least 4 stars.

I bought it yesterday and I installed it (which took a good 20 minutes since it takes up 7gbs. So you'd better make sure you have enough gbs for this game!) and I was a bit disappointed. People put so much enthusiasm on how much less time it took to get in the neighborhood. I did not really see a big difference. My computer had always ran the Sims 2 pretty good.
However, this game is actually good for low-end computers. But the standards for low-end computers are MUCH higher. Which most likely would involve my laptop. It runs perfectly. Everything was smooth. I was surprised because the Sims 2 is usually at least a little choppy whenever I get in the game.

Create-A-Sim 4/5
I started by clicking on create a family, of course. And I was a bit surprised to see how much different the customization was. I was expecting all the bars to be in the same place they were in the Sims 2. But no, it's in different places. I did not get how to use the customization options until my second family. It's much too complicated to explain.
The personality traits REALLY are as good as EA games made it sound. There are several traits to pick from and they all influence your gameplay, lifetime wishes and socialization. The traits are really a lot of fun to play around with! But there aren't enough slots for personality traits to me. You can have only 5 personality traits so you'll have to spend some time picking them. Because not all personality traits affect gameplay as much as you'd like.
The male sims' hairs are COMPLETELY terrible. I thought that there would be options to make hair longer, shorter etcetc. But no, there's no option to do that. You can change colors a lot better than you could before. You can do highlights, tips and roots. I think that's a pretty cool option but it doesn't do any good for the male sims' hairs. Most of them are ridiculous emo styles that even emo guys in their right minds would NEVER style their hair as OR short and stupid styles that are really ugly. This was a huge disappointment to me. The sims has always had more options for female sims than male sims.
There are no zodiac signs anymore. This was a bit saddening to me seeing how I liked that uniqueness the previous Sims games had. This game doesn't feel just as unique anymore.

Gameplay 4/5
When I got in it wasn't choppy at all to my surprise. The sim walked in and made breakfast perfectly smoothly. I was getting a little disappointed at this point because I didn't really know what to do once I was playing. So after a little observation I noticed that the sims tend to just stand there before sitting down for a good 10 seconds. Or before they interact with people they have that annoying delay. It still gets on my nerves. And when the lighting change they will automatically stop in the position they were in and their heads will be moving around. It's a bit annoying.
Remember these three buttons that sped up time? Normal Speed, Fast Speed and Ultra Speed? Say goodbye to these. You will have to watch your sims sleep for 8 whole minutes. Wait for your sim as she/he works for 8 minutes. No more ""just 15 more minutes!"" because everything on this game takes entirely too long. I really hope EA games does something about this because its irritating having to watch your sim sleep for 8 minutes. I mean that's just ridiculous. If you're going to do that at least make the needs easier to satisfy AND make them take less time to decay. That would be a great help.
I did not really get what EA games meant when they put so much enthusiasm on how the needs weren't really a big worry anymore. Because they DO matter. The needs haven't changed. Except for the fact that there isn't a comfortable need anymore. I forget the name for that, sorry for the inconvenience. They don't decay any slower. If anything they decay even faster. The moodlets don't really do much except it'll do good if you're working. That's the only time it really does any good, really.

Skills 4/5
The skills are much more interesting than they were in any other games. You actually have to work for them. You can be a writer, a painter, a bodybuilder and etc. And you can make a lot of money from any skill you build. My sim is a writer and makes 5,000 a week from all the books she has written. I have so many other skills to explore at this point but in my opinion EA games did a great job with this.

Buy/Build Mode 3/5
Nothing new is really added to this. I've never really found any fun in building houses or furnishing them so it was a great option when I found out that you can buy homes furnished OR unfurnished.

Exploring the neighborhood? 5/5
This was a great addition to the game. I was a bit disappointed though. Because when you zoom out to go to community lots you don't exactly see everything in detail. There are icons for the community lots. Bookstores, Libraries, Grocery Stores etc etc. They have some really cool stores, though. I like the bookstores because you can actually buy what books you want. I think it's really cool how you can do that. Beaches? No swimming. Fishing IS available though. But I thought it'd be fun to go swimming or tanning but that's not an option in this game.

Overall 4/5
I think this was a really good game. However, it has no uniqueness to it as the previous games did. I think the llama joke is kind of overworked. That was incorporated into the first sim game and that was 10 years ago. I think it's gotten old by now. How about a new joke? Llamas aren't as funny as they were before. The graphics are just too realistic and it doesn't really feel like a Sims game. It feels like a whole new virtual life game. Before the Sims always had some cartoonish style somewhere but in this game EVERYTHING is so realistic sometimes you just have to stop and look at how realistic it is. The CAS wasn't really as great as it sounded. You can't change heights like they said you would be able to.

This was a pretty nice game. But I see it as the end of the Sims franchise. I can't imagine it improving any at all at this point.

P.S. I used to get annoyed when reviews didn't comment on the things I was so hyped up to hear about. But now I've realized that if people don't mention certain things they weren't that great after all. Since they forgot to write about it so that means if you didn't hear about some things that you wanted to hear about from me.. it wasn't that great after all.",A pretty nice game
B0002XL3BA,4.0,"From all the high reviews this game has been getting, you might think its the best thing since sliced bread. But while this game might be extremely solid and well put together it is not without a couple of problems.

First off, the graphics, movies, sound, voices, and controls are all superb. Every single thing in this is seemless and smooth. Kratos has a ton of moves and yet none are difficult to pull off. The quality and time spent polishing this game really show.

But where the game starts to slide a bit is in its gameplay.

The boss battles in this game are awesome yet they are so few and far between. After killing the hydra in the first level you will probably play 6-8 more hours until you hit the second real 'boss' battle.

In between those 7 hours you will fight about 5 different enemies; Skeletons, harpies, minotaurs, cyclops, and medusas. THATS IT.

Fighting the same 5 enemies hundreds, if not thousands, of times does get old very quick.

And while some of the moves are awesome to behold the first time, you will wish you could skip them later on. Pinning a minataur to the ground was cool the first few times but after the 200th minataur i just thought of the move as a chore.

And what game designer thought those underwater traps and spinning towers of spikes were fun? It is NOT fun to die 30 times in a row at some of those ridiculous traps.

And seeing big bad Kratos tip toe across balance beams was funny too.

In the end, i had a good time with God of War. It was a very solid gameplay experience. However, i find this game to be highly overrated because of its repetitive hack and slash nature and a few of its overly difficult traps.","Good, not great game, with a few flaws..."

There are many new things you can unlock as you progress through the races and the visuals are outstanding.

B005NDIXL2,4.0,"Rhythm Thief is a very cool game. Even if you are not a fan of anime art style you should enjoy the rhythm games that the storyline uncovers through gameplay. The game does not consist of only rhythm tapping and swiping games, but a lot of conversations and collecting of stuff in between. This can be good or bad depending on the type of player you are. Basically, the main character Raphael runs around Paris with his dog to uncover a terrible secret and an evil conspiracy on the way. (this premise is introduced in the trailers. Not spoiler) While music and rhythm games are the main element there is much traversing of the streets and areas to find various characters for information or items. You are also tasked with finding sounds, and landmarks. What this means is every time you arrive to a new location you'll see a detailed background. You have to click around it to find a prize, which is converted to coins. Coins can later be turned in to unlock extra content within the game.

In fact a lot of the art and the clicking is very similar to art of Professor Layton games. But do not confuse the two in gameplay. There are no difficult puzzles to solve in this one. I'd even say a lot of the filler content between the rhythm games is very easy and can be an annoyance. It could take awhile after a main rhythm game until you reach the next one. This will probably be fun for kids, but for adult gamers could be a distraction since there is no meaningful reward for the game itself.

The rhythm games are clever and inventive. They do not simply have to do with dancing on the street for the NPCs to watch, but escaping, running, fighting, playing instruments, and anything you can think of. The developers made a smart move by allowing free access to each rhythm game found within the game in a separate menu so you can try to get perfect scores as much as you like. One game I've found required using the gyroscope to catch things. That actually did not work too well because the gyroscope lags and can't catch up to the game easily, but that game is an exception and is a side mission.

Most of the art in the game is relatively traditional looking anime for kids. Not what people may associate with ""bright spiky hair"", maybe more tame, kid friendly anime art. I'd say it resembles such cartoons like Astro Boy, in which many characters are caricatures. Some of the art and dialogue may be too cutesy and irrelevant. But behind that is a solid game.",Very Fun Game If Not Somewhat Too Simple
B01F74F00I,4.0,"I recently bought the K70 for my son, and he and I both love it. When the K66, my first question was whether it was a better deal than the more expensive (by about 50% of the price of this one) K70. If that's what you are wondering, too, my answer is yes. Everything, from the cable to the material of the keyboard itself, is of better, more durable qualiity on the K70. It's metal where the 66 is plastic. The cable on the 70 is nearly twice as thick and wrapped in braided fabric, rather than plastic. The K70 also comes with special gaming keys and a tool to swap them in or out. My son is thrilled with the K70, and if what you want is primarily a gaming keyboard, I strongly suggest that one over this one.

However, that's far from the whole story on the K66. If you want to game sometimes, but also use your computer for working and/or writing, I like the K66 better. Its action is lighter and quieter. It's also faster. And, yes, it's plastic, but it is still super nice. I get tired trying to type on a laptop, especially if I have to enter numbers. The K66 is a dream for typing - much like the old Mac keyboards: fast, precise, with no ghosting. It doesn't come with a wrist rest, so you will need to buy one separately if you use one.

B00DB9JV5W,4.0,"Its almost exactly like all the other Halos but slightly worse. Disappointing that this game and other Xbox One games aren't very special at all (so Xbox One was mainly just hype). The graphics are slightly worse than other Halos but mostly the same.

I only play the multiplayer and its more boring because you cant customize your character as much. Ive been playing awhile and I only have 3 helmets and 2 of everything else to choose from, thats it. Halo 4 and others had more outfits to choose from. Also, in Halo 5, the req packs are mainly just a rip off (havent bought any and wont; can get free in game). Like all Halos, theres only a few maps to play on if you like objective stuff. The one better thing, in this game, is that you can zoom in with every weapon (standard in all FPSs but was missing in one of the Halos, maybe Reach or Halo 4).

This game is worth a try for its cheap price now, and people, including me, still play it (Summer of 2017). But make sure you don't buy anything but the base game. All the bundles just come with useless req packs, which you can get free in the game. I think the real DLC is free.

I like Destiny better and thats why I bought and played this game late. I don't regret that because I had fun with Destiny and am having a bit of fun now because theres still people playing Halo 5.","4 stars because it's Halo, but it's still disappointing"

B0017R5SYI,4.0,"If you enjoyed Yakuza 1 you should enjoy Yakuza 2 as well, as the two games are nearly identical in gameplay and presentation. Just be aware that Yakuza 2 feels more like a glorified expansion pack than a properly evolved sequel. Yakuza 2's strongest additions are its continuation of Yakuza 1's excellent plot, and a greater emphasis on sidequest variety and humor. Most importantly, Yakuza 2 competently continues the tradition of some of the best writing and cutscene direction you can find in video games. Unfortunately the combat system has barely changed, and you may find the hours of simplistic melee to be draining at times.","When a problem comes around, you must kick it.  Kick it good!"

B00CX9T598,4.0,"If there is one thing Bungie does well it's their breath-taking vistas and heart pounding music.  I can definitely feel Halo's influences.  Each level's design is extraordinary, and gives you a strong desire to explore the location.  The gameplay on the other hand is nothing too specifically, but that doesn't mean that the game is not good.  The AI might me a little predictable, but they are still a challenge, since you have to face so many in a given level.  At some points in the game I felt that I was getting wave after wave of enemies that felt like they were never stopping.  That is why it's better to complete the missions with a buddy or two.  When it comes to weapons there is nothing innovative about them.  They are just your standard shooter game weapons, but I'm okay with that.  Destiny does not deserve a one star for that reason alone.  I also found nothing technically wrong with it.  I had no glitches and everything ran smoothly.  The one thing I wish it had was a character design that was a little more customizable, but that's only a small flaw in my book.  Bottom line is that I'm having fun with it, and is see no reason for all the hate that Destiny is getting!",A Good Game That's Getting Unfair Reviews!

B00B3PDHBU,4.0,"I had my teenage son test these headphones out. He is a gamer.  His overall feedback was positive.  He loved the headphones. Compared to all the other gaming headsets he has owned this one ranked among the top three.  Below are the pros and cons.

- Set-up - Was simple.
- Sound - Good quality.  The volume button can be a bit sensitive, but the volume is impressive.
- Wireless - Our router is located in my home office.  The wireless system was set-up in our living room - about 20 feet away - he had no problems connecting and experienced clear reception when chatting with friends.
- Pre-sets - are a little complicated, but eventually you get the hang of it.
- Headset - Relatively comfortable.  No major issues.  You can also use the headset as regular headphones.  The package comes with a cord so you can use them with your iphone, ipod, android, etc
- Charging Cable - The charging cable is pretty long (12 feet) so you can continue to play while you are charging
- Battery Life - The battery life is about 15 hours- not bad since you can charge and play if you run low on battery and need to recharge.
- Price - I gave it four stars, because I think the set is a bit pricey.
- Original X-box users - Please note, if you want to use an HDMI Cable with the original x-box you will need to purchase an audio adapter cable. You can get one for a couple of bucks here on Amazon.",One of the best headphones I've had

Controls are simple, like turning using the wheel, although for the Mario Kart novice, it may take a little while getting used to manual drift.  My big gripe with the game is the blue shell.  Just because you're in first, doesn't mean you should automatically be wrecked.  The game should emphasize a little more on driving and less on powerups.  Overall though, it is a fun, fast-paced racing game, with everyone's favorite Nintendo character, Mario.",Nice Integration of the Wii Wheel

B001O5CCQK,4.0,"I was looking for a decently priced headset with microphone mostly for gaming and saw this on sale, plus read the great reviews and went for it. I must say the surround sound really puts this one on top. I never really cared that much about sound before until I got these, now everything must be surround sound! For gaming, it's great. I can hear people running up and know exactly where they are located. For music, it's all about the bass.

Microphone quality is great and easy to use. Extra button on the side to mute or simply put the mic upright. Plus the software comes with ways to change your voice. Again, very simple and fun feature.

The controls are an added bonus. I have yet to set the buttons to anything in particular. However, i love the volume control on the side. Makes things much easier when you are in game, no need to try to go to desktop and adjust the sound.

Installing is easy, it comes with software but you really can just plug it in and it works.

The cord is a knit cord which helps protect it from breaking. So far it seems like a really sturdy set that I won't have problems with down the line. It's also comfortable during long periods of wear. You can adjust the padding as well.

The only CONS I would say are it's a little bulky. I don't really mind it but it is worth noting.",Excellent for Gaming and Music

B000GABOTU,4.0,"Final Fantasy 3 is unique in a number a ways,it was the first game to introduce a job system,it was the first fully remade FF. The list can go on,now you may be wondering why I called this a good Final Fantasy and not something more extravagant,well I'll go into that a bit later,for now lets focus on a few other things.

Graphics: The first thing you'll notice as soon as you get past the nice CG opening is that this FF has been brought into full 3D,this is a huge step up from the 8-bit NES graphics of the early '90s. I did notice some slowdown on a few places on the world map,I doubt its because FF3 pushes the DS,but rather its a fault on Square Enixs side. The graphics will look dated when you compare it to FF4,but for a DS game it holds up nicely.

Your probably thinking,""I can't find a single English copy of FF3 for the NES,why is that?"" -Final Fantasy 3 was never brought to NA in the '90s,the NDS remake is FF3's first appearance in NA. (Although you can now get a fully translated FF3 on the Wii)

Gameplay:Gameplay wise this is classic FF style,gone is the ATB,now its just real turn based combat,your characters attack according to who has the better stats,your characters can also be superseded by monsters with better stats. Think of this battle system like FF10's and its not to far from the mark,although if your equipment is lacking or your not in the right job,the bosses will mop the floor with you. A good idea at the start of the game would be to make everyone a Red Mage,and then branch out from there once magic less of a concern.

One thing Square Enix did with FF3 was balance out the Job system,in the old version,all jobs except the 2 special once became useless near the end of the game,SE fixed this by making jobs much stronger then they once were. Nice touch if you like a particular job.

Story:This is why FF3 is only a 'good' FF,the story is somewhat primitive in the character department and reverts back to FF1 in that sense (FF2 had way more character development and a better story all around),SE did add character names and unique looks for each character as well as some back story to each one,but it just doesn't help much,FF3 feels very FF1-ish with different map layout and monsters.

Don't let that shy you away from this game though,it was only my opinion and I'm more of a guy who likes a game with great story (as well as lots of dialogue :D) so I'm a bit biased towards games with little story. Overall this game is cheap to buy now,so give it a try! (Tip:If you think this FF is going to be to hard,if you played FF4 DS and made it 20+hours or beat it,this game will seem like a cake walk,guaranteed!)",A Good Final Fantasy

B000YDIA78,4.0,"The Razer Lycosa is one of Razer's older gaming keyboards, however it's one of my favorite's when it comes to typing. I'm currently typing this review with the Razer Lycosa.

There are some things that need to be addressed, such as:
+This mouse will NOT improve your gaming skills: it's just a very comfortable keyboard. If you want better gaming performance, than this probably isn't the keyboard for you.
+This keyboard doesn't really have any color options other than blue and what region s of the keyboard one wants to be blue.

Overall, it's a pretty nice keyboard, but I wouldn't pay too much for it. Personally, I got mine at a goodwill for $3.50, so it's a nice keyboard for that price, but there might be a better deal if you look around the internet.","A very nice keyboard, but maybe not the best value."
B00269DXCK,4.0,"This game is great. Realize that it came out a while ago, and that if you would be better off with AC Brotherhood than this one, because Brotherhood, if I had to summarize really quick, is this game with better graphics and a more complex player experience.

Pros:
- Great graphics for its time (not so much nowadays)
- A definte step up from AC1 in terms of complexity (of missions, environment, activites, etc)
- Very good deal at $20

Cons:
- If you've played ACB, this is basically a watered-down version.

I think buying ANY game that costs more than $40 is pointless. This is a game I would be willing to pay $40 for, not a mere $20! Buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it. :)","Overall, a solid B+"

B00VZAQ2X8,4.0,"MN9 isn't groundbreaking, but it's definitely a solid and fun game.  The hate train was unfortunately (and understandably) running long before the game released, due to an over 1 year delay, a caustic promotional video poking fun at anime fans, a failed and questionable attempt at another videogame kickstarter (Red Ash) before the release of MN9, and an ultimately rocky launch on various platforms.  Put that all aside though, and the game is a polished platformer in the classic tradition, with a fun dash mechanic and satisfying amount of content to make the game worthwhile to own.  There are certain elements to the game that seem divisive (some dislike the voice acting, others the backgrounds and graphics), but I personally think everything is of a good quality, and certainly nothing mediocre.  It's too bad the game isn't getting a fair shake, since it's actually a fun game that I'd recommend to fans of the MM franchise.","A fun game, and not at all the mediocre production people are making it out to be"
B004774IPU,4.0,"I was a little skeptical before getting this game. I have been a huge fan of the Civ games for a long time, but the reviews I had read made me wary. People talked about all the changes with this game, how it wasn't really even Civ anymore, and how the time between turns takes forever.

It is Civ, that's for sure, but there are some significant changes. The lag between turns is frustrating at times, but the other changes are all great! The inability to stack units and the ability for cities to defend themselves completely redefines the battle tactics of the game. Single units or construction projects are now much more valuable. Frankly the game takes more time to play now, because there is a lot more to think about (which you have time to do in the lag between turns). I love it, and I love the direction that the Civ games are headed.","A Lot of Changes, Mostly Good"
B01D8H09LQ,4.0,"Nice keyboard, operates well.

A unique twist that distinguishes this edition from its predecessors is the ability to switch between 3 different weapons on the fly instead of picking up power ups. There is also a special weapon that shoots in all directions that you can use by holding down circle, but it is not very effective. All in all, a fun game, and worthy of including in any list of Contra games worth owning.",A worthy sequel
B0050SX9VO,4.0,"everything about this game is awesome, they did take the Borderlands 1 formula and made everything even better.  Its the small details that makes it better, the way the quests work now, the ability to trade instead of toss everything on the ground...the fact that drop in drop out and bluetooth just...works now :)

That and all the characters are unique, the writing and characters are top notch, considering a lot of people just want to shoot everything n the face, which is perfectly fine for them to do too.  The humor is fantastic, I always describe it as intellectual humor kind of....mixed with toilet humor.

This review is purely based off of my play through with my normal crew for a 4 player coop game...by itself i could see it being boring, but that isn't the point of Borderlands ....its meant to be played with your friends.

* Update - 3/15/13 *

Well I wrote this review over 6 months ago, game was released in September and here we are now, no level cap....so...my Siren has been capped out for almost 5 months now, and just twiddling my thumbs watching 3 sepereate DLC packs roll out without a single level cap increase.

Really....can't believe how I can go from being so ecstatic about this game to it just sitting on my shelf and I just get more and more upset watching them talk about their 4th DLC pack without giving me any reason to play them with my main.

You can make secondary characters, but...thats not what I enjoy, I enjoy my siren, and she is just sitting around tapping her fingers now.

* Update - 5/04/13 *

Level cap increase came out, so I am finally digging through the DLC campaigns, and having a lot of fun.  Torgue was hilarious, and the Scarlet's Booty was pretty good too....pretty chill, relaxing with your friends, going across the dunes, while Torgue is more action, arena based.  Just starting on Hammerlocks, but overall, feel like I'm playing for the first time.

B002BSA1C6,4.0,"You should consider yourselves lucky that I'm even taking the time out from this game to write this review.  Then again, my B-Spec driver is in a lengthy race, so no harm done.

BUT ANYWAY!

This game features your Arcade mode, a track creator, Gran Turismo T.V., and a Career mode.  I haven't tried the T.V. mode (and can't right now because PSN is down), but the Career mode is where the bulk of the gaming is.  The Arcade lets you try out some cars...keyword: SOME, and you go through the Career to unlock the rest.  Some cars are fairly cheap and still perform well, i.e. the Corvette ZR1 I have with race mods.  Race mods are modifications to the car that turn it into a race car.  The interior, exterior, and some performance parts are upgraded to racing specs.  Thing is, only 11 cars can be modified to race specs.  That doesn't mean those 11 are dominant cars, however.  The EVO IX (or VIII...don't remember) wouldn't beat my GT-R SpecV, considering both are fully modded and tuned properly.  The only cars that are completely dominant over the others are (as they should be) race-built cars, like the Formula One car Ferrari uses or the LMP1 Audi R10 TDI, which was Audi's old LeMans car before the R15 was introduced.

In this mode, you have plenty to do.  You can participate in License challenges which get harder as you progress, you can try your luck in A-Spec races, or teach a driver to perform well in B-Spec races.  A-Spec puts you behind the wheel in the races while B-Spec puts an A.I. driver behind the wheel.  Eventually you begin to unlock special events that you can complete to level yourself up.  The game splits the leveling system into A-Spec and B-Spec levels.  A-Spec leveling is affected by License, A-Spec, and Special Event challenges, while B-Spec can only go up through B-Spec races.

As everyone already knows, Gran Turismo has always been a simulation game, and was first released on the PlayStation.  However, my first simulation racing game was Forza Motorsports on the original Xbox, which led me to the sequel on the 360.  Since I no longer have a 360, I decided to check out GT5: Prologue, which, obviously, was the preview to this game.  I liked it, and picked this up.

I have to say, I haven't been playing anything else but this game.  It's that amazing.....the gameplay, I mean.

Let's start with the good things first.

One thing I LOVE about the game is the realism.  Even though I only played the Forza 3 demo, it failed to hold my attention the way Gran Turismo 5: Prologue did, and helps to the fact that I can hardly put this game down.  It seriously feels like you're in the car, feeling every twist, turn, bump, jump, braking, oversteer, and understeer the car dishes out at you.  If you're losing traction in the rear tires, you're going to feel it through the vibration and how your car handles while you're trying to control it through a corner.  You can also feel whenever your car is going over a bumpy surface, and the sense of speed is simply amazing.  I have yet to play a game where it actually scared me to go too fast because it's like the object is very far away, and suddenly it goes ""SURPRISE! I'm right here! :D"", which makes you drive more carefully when trying to generate a hot lap.

Another thing that's wonderful is the cars.  While I still missed the Tuned Corvette from Prologue (hardly now thanks to the ZR1), I love driving in a GT-R SpecV, or the Zonda R around Laguna Seca, just to see if I can beat my old times.  Though this game features a total of 1,034 cars, only 220 of them are premium, meaning that only 220 cars in the game have damage and in-car views.......among other things, but I can't remember them right now, and they're really not that important, anyway.  One I DO remember is standards only have one light setting (I think) while premium cars have two.....wow, how cool, right?  Something I'll never see on my car unless I'm watching a replay or I'm ALWAYS looking behind me.

There really isn't much I can say that would make anyone think differently about Gran Turismo, but is also good.  It's almost impossible to not understand how realistic this game really is, from the tuning options (though no upgrading brakes.....weird) to being placed into the driver seat of (some of) the cars, you should already know what it has to offer by now.  None of that has changed.  But if you're new to the series, be warned that it is heavily aimed at enthusiasts and people who love cars.  Everyone else is just going to see a big mess and won't understand it.

Now for the bad...

The menu, while it looks nice in some parts, can get a bit confusing when you're trying to look for something in the Career mode.  It's not a huge issue,especially for me, since I can figure out almost anything pretty quickly, but it's not exactly the most user-friendly menu, either.  Another thing I don't like are the standard cars.  They spent around 6 years on this game, but only 220 cars are ""premium""?  There shouldn't even be a difference between them if you're going to spend 6 years on a game.  Then again, Sony did want to heavily push the PS3's 3D capabilities, which isn't Polyphony Digital's fault, but it wasn't a good idea to have 220 cars be ""better"" than the others.  Again, not a huge deal, but noticeable.  I also don't understand why my B-Spec driver is sometimes incredibly stupid, even in situations where I would be able to come out in first place.  Sometimes he won't shift properly, and other times he'll spin for no reason.  They are programmed to make mistakes if they become too excited or too relaxed, but for being level 20, it seems as if some of these shouldn't happen.  Maybe I'm not 100% understanding the system as of now.....but again, can't see why they would make foolish mistakes.

Another thing I didn't like (and this is actually my fault) is I bought a car that I ended up winning a few races later.  It's pretty sad to buy a 2.6million credit (credit is the currency used in this game) Zonda R, only to win it a half-hour after you bought it.

Overall, I love Gran Turismo 5 for its gameplay, but some of the mistakes in the game shouldn't be there, considering it took them 6 years to develop it.  Nevertheless, this is a game I'll be playing for a while, and won't leave my library any time soon.",I feel like a real race driver
B00008DHNZ,4.0,"Star Wars: Clone Wars begins with the Jedi raid on a gladiator arena to save Skywalker and friends, which is a scene from the Clone Wars movie, then the game continues past where the movie ends with a new story. This game is a mission based arcade action style game. To start with, there are different planets, which are scenes that the missions take place. Each planet has at least three major missions to complete, with objectives to each mission, such as fighting your way on foot with your light saber, defending five clone soldiers to pilot a landing ship. That is one objective, then the ship takes off and you must pilot the ship and cover ground troops by destroying cannons and the larger vehicles, once that is done the third objective will be the enemy begins to retreat from the planet in gigantic rockets, and you piloting your landing ship must destroy the ships before they reach orbit. Now that is just one mission and the game offers different aspects of game play. One scene you will control a speedy hover tank, pressing the A button for lasers, pressing the X button for missiles, the next scene you could be on foot playing as a Jedi using your light saber, defending against lasers, pressing the A button to slice, and the X button to throw your saber (it boomerangs back). There are also missions that put you on a speeding bike pursuing guards, landing ships destroying things and picking up allies, there are also starships and jetfighters to pilot as well. Yes the controls are very simple, analog stick to move the craft or your character, X button for special weapons and A button for a laser. When you command a squadron of tanks or starships you may control the party by pressing Up on the directional pad for them to attack, Down to regroup, Left to split up and search for things, Right for them to guard a position (to set up an ambush while you do other things). There is also a nice ""lock on"" feature, once you get an enemy in your sights, they will be locked on, until they move out of range. This might be seen as too easy for advanced players, but the graphics are great, the game makes use of X-Box's incredible power, because it can have hundreds of soldiers and robots firing lasers on the same screen and the game is still very smooth, the loading screens happen at the beginning of each mission. Also, at the beginning of each mission and sometimes objective there is a cut scene, an animated story that continues the game's story. Star Wars has never been as good with dialog as it is with the overall story and action, so don't expect movie scripting. There are no ""cinematic"" movies, but the cut scenes are when the graphics really shine, when you can see Skywalker's pores on his face that is detailed. Although there are secret objectives like destroying all 100 soldiers, or completing the a mission in a few minutes, the game still does not add much replay value for those who do not like the Star Wars series. The soundtrack lacks a lot of originality, its still the same soundtrack that seems to be in all other Star Wars games (symphonic music). The online play lacks in a big way; psychology, there is no game of cat and mouse when competing against other players with the X-Box Live play, instead its just you and other people seeing who can fire the missiles the fastest.  There are team-based missions to play via X-Box Live that can be enabled by competing levels in the game. The game is rated Teen, because it can get quite difficult sometimes. Clone Wars can also be found as a part of the X-Box Live 2003 X-Box Holiday Bundle.","Big action, variety of objectives /vehicles, simple gameplay"
B00576U7JG,4.0,"The game take s you to Earth after a great alien war. You start as someone who goes around trying to pick up pieces or Ark tech to make money.

There is a really good group of people who play this and there is no ninja looting. If you see loot on the ground it is yours as you can only see stuff that is dropped for you. So there are no hard feeling about stealing kills or loot or xp. Very fun and easy to play. Weapons are that are earned through drops and vendors do level up with you. So as you earn EGO rating the weapons at the vendor become better as do the drops. The only thing this game really needs is an auction house and a storage area. Nothing super hard. I could see them coming out with it soon. And some filter for friends and clan members. Really good game, glad I bought it at $20. It is well worth it. I have had tons of fun with it.","Fun shooter, that is an MMO"
B0010AYJXI,4.0,"If you want a psychological horror story that forces you to pay attention to the details while unraveling a supernatural mystery, then this is a rare treat for you.  If you just want to shoot zombies, then you'd probably have more fun playing Resident Evil 5 or Left 4 Dead 2.

Concept:  10/10
Alan Wake is a famous writer who is struggling with writer's block.  He goes on a short vacation to the Pacific Northwest with his wife to relax and get some fresh air.  Upon his arrival to the quaint little town of Bright Falls, something goes awry and he is sucked into an insane world of darkness.  He quickly realizes that he is living in one of his stories.  A thriller.  But this thriller has been corrupted and is becoming a horror story.

Story:  9/10
The main draw to Alan Wake is the Stephen King style writing.  This is a very deep and complex story and if you aren't paying attention, you may not understand the ending.  There are plenty of discussions about it on youtube.  The dialogue is very well written and there's some pretty good acting.  I'm not going to spoil anything here, but the more you focus on the details, the more you will get out of the game.

Gameplay:  7/10
There are two types of gameplay:  Exploration and Combat.
This is not an open world game like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption.  These are levels put together to create very wide areas where you are encouraged to explore and find collectibles.  You can find pages of Alan's Manuscript, Thermoses of Coffee, weapons, ammo, and items.  Most of these just unlock achievements or help Alan in combat.

The Combat is very simple and somewhat repetitive.  After dark, the People of Bright Falls become criminally insane lunatics smothered in shadow.  Armed with crude weapons, they try to kill Alan.  To make matters worse, only light can harm them.  Lucky for Alan, he's armed with flashlights (beam), flash bangs (grenade) , flares (timed area of effect), and small arsenal of common guns.  When you see an enemy, you must first get light on them to remove the darkness.  Once the darkness is banished, they're vulnerable to gunfire.  Enemies will charge, throw weapons, and try to hack you to bits and you can dodge or sprint for a short time to escape.  Light in the game represents a safe haven for Alan Wake.

There are times when the darkness corrupts objects or flocks of ravens, too.  They become possessed and fly at Alan.  He must dodge, escape, or use light to neutralize the darkness in the objects.  That's pretty much it.  But most people will be playing this game for the story and atmosphere.

Graphics:  9/10
The graphics are very good.  The Seattle-esque town of Bright Falls looks pretty amazing in the day.  There are snow capped mountains, dense forests, and all of the things you'd expect to see in a small town.  The characters could look better, but they aren't bad.  The art direction did take a Stephen King (realistic and familiar) approach.  What is more scary to you?  A gigantic demon or your maniacally grinning uncle trying to cut your face off with a kitchen knife while he quotes the Bible?  The enemies in the game are not wicked demons sporting curved horns and fanged maws.  They're people who could be your friendly neighbors... except now they're possessed.

Sound:  8/10
The sound is very good and contributes to the atmosphere.  It does a great job at setting the mood and providing audio cues for gameplay.  The voice acting is pretty good overall.

Maturity:  Teen
This is a horror game and is very much like a Stephen King movie.  It's not overly gory and there isn't any nudity.  It is more like an interactive horror novel.

Replay Value:  5/10
There are 3 difficulty modes and some DLC.  You may also want to play some areas over again to explore and get achievements.  But there is no multiplayer or branching story arcs.

Overall:  8.5/10
To some people, this game will be a masterpiece.  A perfect blend of psychological horror and action that hasn't been seen since Silent Hill 2.  To others, it may seem like a mediocre action game with a confusing story.  If you're willing to search for clues in the story and pay attention to details, then you will enjoy this game.  If you just want to blow through an action game, then you probably won't like Alan Wake.

B000R0URCE,4.0,"I thought this game was fantastic!  I love the fantasy world of Star Wars, and I thought that the developers did an excellent job of telling a story that weaves neatly between episodes 3 and 4 bridging the old and new trilogies.
You play a powerful force child, taken from your father by Vader (who subsequently kills your father)  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the story is really good, and once I finished it, I was really surprised at how much impact on the Star Wars Cannon, George Lucas allowed this game to have.
Is this the best game ever?  No.  The graphics are great, the movie/story scenes are fantastic, excellent CG work that makes you fell like your watching a movie.  The Force powers are perfect.  When you rip a massive door open, it makes you feel powerful.  If your a Star Wars fan, you'll likely love this.  If your someone that complains about anything that connects to and changes your view of the original trilogy then you'll be upset just like you probably were about the new trilogy, so go play Viva Pinata instead.",Feel the force!

B000LV9N8S,4.0,"This was the first game to make me truly proud to own an Xbox 360.  And to think, when I began the game, I only played single player, I hadn't even touched coop.  Coop is the reason to play this game, well that is if blowing up gigantic ants, spider, robots, alien space ships etc wasn't entertaining enough.
You are a member of the Earth Defense Force, your job-defend this Great Blue Earth-from any manner of the aforementioned foes.  You may equip any two weapons you unlock as you play.  Arsenal wise, you will acquire the standard assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, grenade, grenade launcher, turrets and maybe even a laser bazooka, missile pod and acid throwers to boot.  Oh, and there are vehicles, but on the higher difficulties they're destroyed much too quickly for them to really matter if not used with maximum distance from any enemies that don't fire projectiles...by the way, most enemies *do* fire projectiles.
Boss fights are scarce albeit tremendous and rarely difficult.  The final boss on Inferno, the highest difficulty, is only difficult because of its screen filling homing lasers that steadily whittle down your health if it isn't high enough.
Which brings me to upgrades; enemies will drop new weapons, healing items and max health boosting items, although weapon drops vary by the level and difficulty.  So farming is possible and potentially necessary if your luck isn't quite up to snuff.
Bear in mind that this game was a budget title and so it isn't the prettiest but it plays like a champ and while the coop isn't over Live, split screening with a friend is the most fun you'll probably have over any Gears of War or Halo.  The experience draws from old school beat'em ups in pleasure, minus the crushing need for quarters...",Who says budget titles can't be awesome?
B00KSVXSZU,4.0,"Not going to lie, I prefer the fit and feel of my old X12s for the 360. These are not quite as comfortable and they do not feel as sturdily made -- the head band is thin plastic and there is only a small stretch of padding (visible in the photo) at the top of the band for the crown of your head. Because the over-ear portions of the headset are more thinly constructed than the X12s (or XOsevens) they do not block out as much outside noise. The typical Xbox one headset model seems to have a game/chat audio balance button and a universal volume button, which can be confusing if you are used to the 360 models that let you adjust the volumes independently (which again, I prefer).

The sound quality, however, is excellent. There is a bass boost toggle button that provides three bass levels; it feels effective though I still prefer the old wheel model for its range and flexibility. Chat voices are clear. The mic itself is flexible, but because it is removable it cannot be raised or lowered, which means you have to bend the arm to change its position. And the biggest plus is that the headset has a single cord that runs to the Xbox one controller, rather than 12 feet of cord connecting to your xbox/tv, an audio port and a preamp.

In summary: solid product overall if you're looking for a first stereo headset and don't want to drop the cash for a nice pair of Astros or the XOSevens, but if you have a nice 360 headset you should consider hanging on to it and picking up the converter.",These are not quite as comfortable and they do not feel as sturdily made -- ...
B000FUG5V8,4.0,"I prefer my old Xbox Live headset over the one that came with the 360, but not having volume control or mute functionality was a bit of a pain.

This solved that problem. My only complaint is that the volume control wheel is sort of tough to turn. I have to grip one of the ridges with a fingernail to manipulate the thing.

This fan works great. It is a simple unplug and pull out the old fan and pop in the new one. It has an adapter for the 2 styles of power pins Microsoft has used to power the fan so you are okay no matter what (for all pre slim models).

The fan moves a lot of air and is quiet as you would expect. It is not a quiet fan by any means, but for the amount of air it is moving it isn't as loud as it could be. I feel it is about the same as the stock fan, but moves much more air.","Good Fan, Perfect Replacement"

B01GW3OHMK,4.0,"This review is for the PS4 version.

As others have said, this game in some respects reminds me of Bioshock and other games like that.  It has a good creepy atmosphere with some really nicely done graphics and level designs with the exception of the black blob enemies.  This is a bit less of an all-out action shooter and blends some elements of using the environment and stuff around you to progress through the game (which reminded me a bit of the Dishonored games).  It can be frustrating at times trying to progress due to the lack of clear direction of what you need to do though as well as the limited supplies can be a bit frustrating.  A but too many, notes, books and the like to read, which tend to slow things down a bit too much. Load times are a bit long and slow.  I am not sure at this point in the game that I am, that I like this better than the Bioshock or the Dishonored series, but I do find it fun and entertaining, especially the holiday sale price I got it for.

They've also taken the criminal world of the Yakuza, stereotypes and all, and transported it into the game.  Maybe it's because I live in Japan, but I got a real kick out of playing the ""bad but honorable"" main character in such familiar surroundings.  The only real flaw is the camera control -- the camera gets flaky every once in a while.  The player should have full camera control and the auto control could have used more polish.

The core of the game is match-3, as you make chains of same-color tiles to clear boards.  You'll have to break blocks and chains, get rid of rocks, etc.  This is pretty much standard match-3 fare, but there are lots of levels, so you get quite a bit for your money.

B000TG52YY,4.0,"I thought I was about to play one of the worst racing games ever, but to my surprise this game become very addicting, very quickly.

Until this game, games like Mario Kart and Asphalt Urban GT 2 where at the top of my list of favorite racing games, but this one I think I have been the most addicted to.

to start off you have 3 sets of rounds you can play. You must complete the first to unlock the next, which is Turbo, Nitro and Something else... in each category is 4 sets of races on each of the 4 tracks, and then a tournament. In the first tournament, you start on the Desktop track. The first race is is a normal 3 lap race, to see who comes first. The second is elimination, where every 30 seconds the person in last place is eliminated till there is only 1 car left. The 3rd is destroy all your opponents.

On the tracks, there is some pretty good areas for a DS game. Racing along desktops, golf courses and what not. You also can drive through rings of random power ups, you can get nitro blasts, ice things that you shoot and if it hits an opponent they will be frozen in ice for about 3 seconds, this electricity thing that does the same sort of thing as the ice, a health shield that protects you from enemy attacks, mines, a plasma bomb that will take away enemy's weapons if they have any, and 3 rockets to blast at your opponents.

Also there is a bar that says hotwheels, when you do enough skids or tricks, im not sure what exactly regenerates this, but once it flashes, you can power up your weapons by hitting the R button. Your rockets will become heat seeking, 3 x mines & Ice, and longer range or time on the plasma and shield.

It may sound a bit boring running about 120 races through the same 4 levels, but each time, there is a mission to do. It may be to destroy between 10 to 30 opponents, race through all the shortcuts, do a perfect landing on a stunt, or gain a certain amount of points... but there is one flaw in the game.

On the last level, in the first desktop tournament. It tells you you have to go through every shortcut. But on the 3rd round of the tournament, there is no shortcut on the track, making it impossible to get a perfect completion score.

As you win races, you unlock the next race, till you get the tournament which is 4 races in a row, one after the other, and when you win, you unlock the next category, and extra cars. There is about 30 cars, all ranging in different speeds, grip, handling and how fast they gain the hot wheels charge up.

Overall, besides there being no shortcut as i mentioned, and the occasional glitch, which i thought made the game look more interesting, this is a pretty good little racing game. Very easy at first, but does pose a few challenges in later levels.","Fun little game, but has it's cons"
B0012NAPNQ,4.0,"Boy, it's hard to review Just Cause 2. The game has impeccable gameplay, and gives the player the resources to explore its massive island nation. On the other hand, the game's writing is abysmal, its main character a generic grunty dummy with zero charisma, and the sheer largeness of the game gets in the way of its focus. Is it fun to play? It's crazy fun. But more importantly, it's crazy; Just Cause 2 is over-designed to a fault, and I think I liked it even though I couldn't convince myself to keep playing it.

Just Cause 2 drops you into the shoes of Rico Rodriguez, a man with the super power to summon a parachute at any time and cancel the momentum of anything with a hookshot. He's sent to an island nation to destabilize it in order to... well, that's about the time I stopped paying attention to the plot. You want a plot? Blow things up, there's your plot. Really, in this case- causing damage to military properties raises your Chaos meter, which in turn unlocks new story missions. This is really the only point of the gameplay at which I can level a real complaint; I'd like to be able to simply play through the game, and, I dunno, unlock side missions by causing Chaos. What kept me from completing Just Cause 2, in fact, was the fact that I needed to grind blowing up military bases in order to get the game flowing again.

On the plot of the game, I didn't follow it too well, mainly because I plain don't like Rico. He's another generic action hero badass without any motivation, and I frankly am getting tired of them. I'd really like to see games attempt to get out of this mold; Nathan Drake and Cole McGrath (though he does have the gravelly voice) are the only modern heroes I can think of that are allowed feelings and a normal speaking voice. I'd love to see an Errol Flynn-style hero in a modern video game, if nothing else than to break up the endless waves of Marcus Fenix wannebes. But I'm getting off topic.

Just Cause 2's game world has been touted as the largest ever created, and boy howdy, is it. You could spend hours admiring the scenery, in fact, some of my best moments involved climbing the highest mountain I could see, jumping off the top, and drifting for miles with my parachute from miles high; seeing the trees unfold beneath me and watching the cars and people go from atom-sized to life-size. There's something new and great about just that experience, and the game may be worth playing just to do that.

The gunplay of Just Cause 2 is pretty standard stuff, fitting as it does in the Grand Theft Auto mold. What surprised me is that getting ammo is a little difficult; enemies don't carry a lot, and purchasing guns from the dealer is extremely expensive. Maybe there was some way I wasn't seeing, I dunno. The driving in the game is fun, especially since the game offers you the option to open your parachute from INSIDE any car, jetting the car into building or person in front of you in spectacular fashion while you watch from above. I recommend using motorcycles in this way too.

So Just Cause 2 is a massive game with lots to do, and fun ways in which to do it. I prefer more focus in my games, personally, but I can't really say much to disparage it. If you like open world games, pick this up; it takes the premise about as far as it can possibly go, for better or for worse.",Parachute wizardy abounds

B00X87BLK0,4.0,"I didn't play Unity for oblivious reasons. Now I'm having second thoughts about it because I just finished up Syndicate......at least the main story....and I freaking loved this game and I'm eager to play another one.....even Unity

Assassin's Creed Syndicate takes place in jolly old England during the industrial revolution.  We had the American revolution, the French revolution and now it's time for the industrial revolution.

Jacob and Evie Frye are on the hunt for a Piece of Eden....but so are the Templars.  It's your typical Assassin's Creed game: freeroam and there's a lot to do in this game besides assassination.  You can help Jacob conquer the Templars on the streets or switch to Evie as she tracks down the Shroud.

The ""future story"" has been in a slump since they got rid of Desmond. Yeah I know Desmond wasn't exactly pivotal to the games but at least he was his own character.

Since there's no Assassin's Creed game this year (that I applaud) is the reason why I'm considering playing Unity.  I heard Unity isn't a bad game but the bugs killed it off.....it was so bad that the developers apologized for it.

B00113X7YQ,4.0,"Let me first preface this with the following - I am an unabashed fan of everything Star Wars.  I will generally give Star Wars movies, games, etc. the benefit of the doubt because I enjoy them as a whole.  This game represents a landmark, with Lucas including the story arcs from the game itself as canon.  This is huge.  As great as KOTOR and KOTOR 2 were, they have not been officially adopted into Star Wars canon, but Force Unleashed has.

The story is very cool so far.  For those of you who've read the book, you already know where it will go, but it's great to watch it unfold in the game.  I have only played the opening level (as Darth Vader, how cool is that?), but can generally comment on the overall quality and feel of the game.

Using ""God of War: Chains of Olympus"" (GOW) as a benchmark for great PSP gaming, Force Unleashed (SWFU) lags in playability and appearance.  The graphics are good, but not great.  The controls are good, but not great.  There are some missed opportunities with the controls that may come into play further into the game, but where I am at, it seems like there would be more functionality in controlling the force powers of a character like Darth Vader.  I don't know how GOW could set the bar as high as it did, and have nobody follow suit.  GOW is an incredible game, both in terms of playability and graphical grandeur.  SWFU, so far, is less impressive.

In the end, I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it ... I don't know if I would have really felt that great about parting with the $40 that this game costs.  I think for $30, it's a more attractive package.

Overall, I'm sure I will enjoy the game ... after all, it's Star Wars.  However, I wish that Lucas would stop promising greatness and delivering mediocrity.  From the new Clone Wars ""movie"" (honestly, you want me to pay how much to watch a 90 minute commercial?), to the long run of hits and misses in the gaming world ... there is enough data there to understand what the consumers want and what we're willing to pay for it.  If you're going to cut corners on the gameplay to make room for cut scene animation, fine, just don't sell it like you made everything perfect.  Star Wars fans will eat this game up ... and I will probably play it over and over.  Non-fanboys (and girls) will want to wait until the price drops and probably buy it used.  It's fun, but for non-die-hard fans, I don't think the value is quite there to pay full price.",If Only Ready at Dawn Studios Made This
B01GD490UM,4.0,"Please.  Do not look at photos and screenshots, or even videos, and make wild assumptions.

I can't stand Minecraft.  I come from an era where we had Legos to play with, and it was great fun building all sorts of things and even collecting McDonalds Lego packs so we could do even more.  This is NOT that, nor is it anywhere close.

This game is 80% RPG, 20% sandbox builder.  It's way more RPG than not.

Now, that said...

Dragon Quest Builders is a ""what if"" story.  It plays directly to those who played Dragon Warrior I (as it was called in the US when it was released) and remember the ending.  The DragonLord gave you a choice: fight him (good ending) or join him (bad ending).

This was a real thing, and mind you, before we had this ""Interwebs"" nonsense you younguns take for granted - so there was no searching to figure out which answer to choose unless you bought the cheat book (aka strategy guide).  But I digress.  In the first game, if you picked to join him, he tells you he'll destroy the world, and the game ends.  That's where Dragon Quest Builders picks up: the hero has selected the ""wrong"" choice, and now the world is thrown into disaster.

You, as ""The Builder"" are the only person left alive who has the ability to rebuild the world, and are tasked by Rubiss (introduced with Dragon Warrior II) to do so.  You were dead, but don't remember who you were or why you are the only one with the skill.  You'll eventually hit four mainstays of the original game: Cantlin (the Castle Town, guarded by a golem where you needed a flute to put him to sleep), Rimuldar (the Lake Town just north of the shrine and south of the lake cave), Kol/""Galenholm"" (original name was Garinham and frankly, not sure why they were combined, but whatever), and Tantegel.  Hauksness is not represented, for some bizarre reason, possibly because in the original game it was already destroyed (that's the town where you find Erdrick's Armor).

In Builders, these lands have been separated by magic, thus they require teleporters to reach.  You'll not be freely walking around to each area, they are treated as separate ""Chapters"" in a way.  Even the saves do not overlap, and you cannot carry over items or progress to each.  The only thing you do keep is your list of recipes and building requirements - so you know how to do stuff, but you won't keep the items that do it.  That has to be done over and over again for each Chapter.  This is half a reason I dinged a star - it's a stupid strategy.  Having a separate save bucket for every Chapter is quite similar to Dragon Quest/Warrior IV, except in that game, you eventually got all of your items back at the last chapter.

The other reason I dinged a star is that you don't actually ""level up"".  Your towns do, but again, you lose this progress from chapter to chapter, and your HP never goes above 120-ish because you simply won't find enough Seeds of Life to do so.  You never get really ""strong"", and some enemies will simply blow through you like it's nothing.  But by the end of the chapter, you'll be nigh unstoppable, though it happens way too late for you to really enjoy it. The only exception was Cantlin, where you did get a measure of strength roughly midpoint through the game.

Each chapter has a bit of freedom to the flow.  You can go as fast or as slow as you really want to, though there are hidden quests that are looking for you to finish in less than 20 game ""days"".  Doable, but you'd really have to rush to get this done.  I found myself taking an average of 120 days to comfortably finish each chapter - that's making sure the city stays leveled up and well defended from attacks, making sure I had rooms and build resources, and collecting enemy drops while avoiding nighttime enemy attacks (certain enemies attack only at night and can fly over walls quite easily).  Also the sheer size of some of the maps means you're going to do a lot of walking just to make sure you don't miss some exciting hunt (dragons, orcs, etc) or some mysterious cave (minerals).

Summarizing the experience of each area --

CANTLIN: This is the first land and the theme here is ""Defense"".  After you wake up and start building the town, your goal is to focus on rebuilding, mostly.  There aren't any real ""quests"" except for finding people or items.  There are some dragons you can fight near end game.  The boss is the original golem that guarded the town, and while I wouldn't consider him ""hard"", he's a bit annoying to fight simply because of the battle engine and the speed with which your character moves.

RIMULDAR: This is the next land and the theme here is ""Negative Status"" (i.e. poison, paralysis, confuse, etc).  I felt that this was the overall most tedious, most difficult of the four simply because of these status effects.  You do eventually get an accessory that deals with it, but not until past the midpoint.  Before that, it's just annoying and tedious at first.  Once you're past midpoint, it becomes a breeze except for the boss, which is the Hades Condor (first seen from Dragon Warrior III).  His problem is distance - he's far away, and while you will get a weapon to deal with that, again, your slow movement delays killing him, resulting in a very tedious fight.

KOL/GALENHOLM (Garinham): The theme here is ""Magic"".  While you don't get any spells, you will get weapons and armor that are magically inclined past the midway point.  The problem is that you will have an extremely difficult time just getting food for the first half of the chapter.  As you get characters to your town, they can then join up with you to go fighting, and this helps a little, except when it comes to defending the town.  They will ALMOST ALWAYS die, leaving you to fend for yourself against tough opponents.  The last boss is a Fire/Ice demon (Think Gill from Street Fighter III: Third Strike) that really doesn't do anything.  Near the end, you will get a weapon that, again, makes these last fights and the last boss terribly easy, but by then it's too late because you've already struggled for hours getting to that point.

TANTEGEL: There's no theme to this one.  It plays out like a free roam with a story behind it.  You'll be responsible for figuring out what to do once you're released to the castle.  After you obtain a key item, then it's business as usual with quests and the like, but you'll be provided with some of the items that were extremely useful from each of the other chapters to help you.  This happens again past midpoint.  Up until that point, the only real hard part is that you don't have anything to really guide you to finding the items you need, just high level hints as to what to try.  Once you figure some stuff out, the rest then makes sense.  I won't spoil the after effects, but I will say that of the four chapters, Tantegel was overall the most fun with the exception of one area that has to do with Rimuldar.  Fun because again, it felt like ""controlled freedom"" if that makes sense.

It's taken me literally days to get through these four with a full time job.  I would estimate at least 50 hours all told and that's not including Terra Incognita.  Considering how short Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness was, this was a breath of fresh air.

Once you finish Cantlin, there is an area called Terra Incognita.  Those that really want a ""Minecraft-ish"" experience will want this area.  It is essentially building with no story behind it and very little limitations.  I actually couldn't stand this when I tried it.  I much prefer the story-driven tasks of the first four chapters over ""sandbox"" and it is for this reason I say that this is absolutely an RPG at heart.  It just doesn't feel like much of a game without the Dragon Quest story, and if it had been released without Dragon Quest-ness, it would have failed miserably, in my opinion.

This is definitely worth a look if you're a Dragon Quest fan and absolutely worth the full price IMO (I payed $48 through Prime).  If you an overlook the bias of Minecraft you'll find a solid story underneath, especially if you played Dragon Warrior I and remember the choice.  That's where the real game shines.  If you're a Minecraft fanatic that never played or never cared about Dragon Warrior, this game won't draw you in.  You'll feel limited, restricted, because the game does block certain builds and actions due to the story.","This is an RPG, NOT a Minecraft clone.  Thee must not be fooled."
B000W5RBQE,4.0,"I really don't find much use for a keyboard with the PS3.  I've used this keyboard with my PS3, but I have found that it is VERY convenient for use with my computers, so that's what I will comment on here.

CONS:

Limited keys.  As other reviewers have noted, no Windows key, and a few others that you would normally find on a PC keyboard.  For this reason, I wouldn't have this keyboard be the ONLY keyboard you use.

No volume control.  If you are used to having a volume control on your keyboard, you will miss it.

Keys are not backlit.  They are white on black, so you won't have too much trouble, but still you may miss it if you are used to it.

Trackpad only scrolls up and down, does not zoom like your laptop trackpad probably does.

PROS:

It's QUIET to type on, and the keys are responsive.  Very pleasant.

It is VERY convenient to have a wireless keyboard with a trackpad.  For instance: your laptop is hooked up to your TV, and you are on the couch or in bed or whatever.  If you are just messing around on the internet or email, or anything, you don't have to worry about having a surface to mouse on.  you will be surprised at how great this is.

It is LIGHT. Surprisingly light, but durable and not at all flimsy.  this is a quality product.

It takes up very little desk space, but has NORMAL SIZE KEYS.

Works for gaming just as well as any normal keyboard would.  No lag, etc.  I typically use this keyboard and a wired mouse (obviously you can't use the trackpad for most games).

The battery life is pretty decent.",VERY Convenient KB with built-in trackpad for PC use

B004CDBP9G,4.0,"First of all let me just say one thing, i am new to American Mcgee's Alice, and i took a shot in the dark despite all the criticisms in the megazines(every one had a score below a 6), and it was worth my money. It just goes to show that the mainstream is not always correct on every game Now let us get onto the review.

In Alice Madness,this game is a platformer/hack and slash with hints of puzzles and RPG elements(upgrade you're weapons and figure out where you need to go with exploration) . This game becomes simpler once you get the hang of fighting and jumping, because as you progress there will be more enemies, and you will have more weapons in you're arsenal to tactically take out each enemy.

One part i found unique about the game was that when you look at the backgrounds throughout each level it does make you believe you are in Wonderland and the memories help you relate to the backstory of this game and the original. One part that kept me from giving this a 5 was the framerate,textures which was rare.",Within wonderland a new madness forms.

B00005BJ9G,4.0,"Castlevania: Circle of the Moon was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance back in 2001. It's been a few years since a 2D Castlevania game was released to the public and they were hyped to hear it was coming to the GBA. While it made an impact, this game brought mixed results that fortunately was more good than bad.

Castlevania: Circle of the Moon follows a new main character named Nathan Graves on his quest to defeat Count Dracula in a brand new castle. Much like every Castlevania game so far, you control the main character and he is armed with a whip. You can pick up weapons along the way to use against the enemies and bosses. A new feature was introduced to this game: the card attribute system. You can find and acquire different kinds of action and attribute cards. When you combine certain cards together, you unlock special effects that enhance your whip or weapons to deal greater damage. This comes in handy as the game gets harder. The castle you explore is huge but not every area is accessible from the get go. Be ready to backtrack often because the items you need to help you progress further into the castle requires you to visit areas you can't get into before. When you need to take a break or want to continue your game later, look for save rooms located throughout the castle to save your progress anytime.

The PROS: It's a brand new 2D Castlevania game since Symphony of the Night and Circle of the Moon is a fun game to play. It continues with the new ""Metroid-vania"" game play style established by the PS1/Saturn title so exploring the castle takes awhile and is entertaining as well. The controls and sounds are excellent and are perfect for highlighting what the GBA was capable of doing early on in its debut to the world. The new card attribute system works well and is fun to mix and match cards to see what effects you activate; there are so many that it will keep you busy trying to find them all as some are rare and others appear more often. This game is also challenging so at some points it will get hard but not to the point that you want to give up.

The CONS: This game is dark....literally speaking. Konami went out of their way to set the mood here to make this castle you explore spooky by making every area dark; it worked too well because it is hard to see where you are going because of the lighting. And when your eyes adjust to it, you'll realize that the graphics aren't that great. They are decent but not what you expect from a Castlevania game. Because of the graphics, the animation is also lacking. While it doesn't ruin the experience, you can't help to notice how they somewhat dropped the ball in these two areas.

Castlevania: Circle of the Moon made an excellent debut on the GBA and was worth picking up as one of the launch titles for the new handheld system back then. Despite its shortcomings, it a fun game that carries on the tradition that is associated with a Castlevania title. It's hard to find nowadays and it very expensive to buy it new so you are better off getting it used. If you like action adventure games and/or you're a fan of the series, this game is worth investing your time in.",Circle of the Moon makes it debut on the GBA
B003E2SUW6,4.0,"I bought this product because I wanted to prop up my ps3 slim (obviously), I always liked the upright look of consoles much better than the down on all fours (so to speak) look. Now to the product, it has a nice glossy carbon fiber look to it, I like it how it looks on my ps3, it has some rubber bumpers on the inside of the stand to hold the ps3 in place, they work well enough and do the trick, however, I have to say that it is true what other reviewers are saying in that if you hit it from the left side it could be prone to falling over, for whatever reason, either the lip isn't high enough on the left side or the bumpers aren't securing it in place good enough, this is the case, it is however not a bit deal if you are getting this stand and putting your ps3 on a table or desk or somewhere that will not be messed it very much or there is not a lot of traffic, whether its people passing by or kids are able to get to it...etc. I do have to say though, that it is not THAT easy to knock it over from the left side, it still takes a good hard nudge (at least for mine), I have tested it. I have mine on my desk and there is not really any through traffic there and the only time that it see's any kind of traffic or action is when i put in or remove a disc from the ps3 itself.

In conclusion, this is a very good product, but it has that one minor flaw that is not a problem at all as long as there won't be a lot of movement in the area you put your ps3 in. It looks great and does the job well, I give it 4 stars and if it wasn't for it having that minor flaw I would have given it 5.","Does the trick, and a good puchase"

I fully enjoy this game as an old school gamer and my 5yr old son loves it as well. Good daddy / son bonding time as well! :) This game can be a little challenging at times, so i help my boy get through those parts, but mostly he has picked it up and completes all the levels by himself. Definitely 5 stars for fun factor, the only reason i took away a star for overall rating is because sometimes after beating a level, you try to move to the next, but it says there has been something unacomplished in the previous level you thought was completed. It doesnt give much of a hint of what you missed as i have went through that same level 5 times and somehow keep missing whatever it is im supposed to find. But, even playing those levels over and over is still fun, as there is so much to do and explore so it doesnt get repetitive.

B0037UCTCW,4.0,"My children (6 and 4) love the Lego games. Over the past couple of years they've unlocked every character, on their own, from the two Star Wars games and the Indiana Jones game. They also love Lego Batman. These games are great because they are basically no-fail games that stress working together, puzzle-solving, and are just plain fun. They are also extremely ""wholesome"". No gore, silly cartoon violence (people don't die, they just break a part like a Lego).

When we saw Lego Clone Wars at Target in a playable form their two heads nearly exploded in excitement. It was more than a month before release and each time we revisited Target we had to stop by the video game department so they could play that same level again. Lo and behold, the Easter Bunny tucked the game into my oldest son's basket. Needless to say, he was excited.

And then he played it.

Let's just say that this game is only a Lego game in the broadest sense when compared to the others. They are Lego pieces and the levels are no-fail. You unlock characters through level completion (and by buying them) and there are some cute moments. But something has happened to the gameplay - it got too hard. This game is difficult. When the previous games were difficult it was because they were throwing a lot of enemies at you. This one is difficult because the objectives are not always clear and sometimes you just don't know where to go/what to do. There have been a couple spots where it took me helping them to progress and, honestly, I was stumped for a bit on them. In all of the previous games these moments were RARE/non-existent.

Here's the thing - this game is rated E-10, just like the others. But this is probably the only game in the series that actually warrants that rating and this is important. Because a lot of parents are going to buy this game thinking it is appropriate for their 5-7 year old. There is a lot of fun to be had here, but my kids grow frustrated at times. Just be ready for that.

I know I sound like I have a negative slant, but taking the game on its own merits it is a great game. The graphics are literally twice as good as the previous games. It has a very epic feeling. Navigating the hub world and level selection is a little more confusing than any of the other games, but there are a lot of neat touches. For example, rather than buying unlockables at a counter you actually find it in the hub world somewhere. If it is a person, you'll see him walking around and when you approach you'll see his price.

The game really is good and if you are 10 or more you will love it. Younger than that and I suspect you will need some parental guidance at times.",It seems the developers decided to go another direction with this one

B000V1OUVI,4.0,"Having played the Unreal series only sparingly over the years, I would consider myself somewhat of a noob.  I've never been big on online multiplayer, but I have dabbled in it with Warhawk and Resistance.  That being said, I think UT3 is helping me become more and more interested in this weird online craze.  UT3 is quite astonishing to look at.  The environments are beautiful and the textures look about the same as Uncharted and Gears.  I would say the graphics are about the same as Gears of War (made by the same developers).  The ability to get into a match sometimes takes a while (10 to 20 seconds for me), but if that's fast enough for you then great.  The single player campaign is rather weak.  There really isn't much of a substantial story, but rather it's more practice for the main event, online multiplayer.  This is where UT3 shines.  The action is fast and frenetic.  The weapons (both primary and secondary fire) are satisfying.  I experienced some lag until I fully installed the game on my PS3 (you can either fully install or play from the disc).  After installation, everything was smooth sailing.  I enjoyed the ability to fully customize my character's appearance (boots, chest plate, helmet, you name it).  I'm giving this game 4 stars mainly due to its weak single player campaign.  That's my favorite part of FPS's, so I was a little disappointed in UT3's campaign.  All in all, it's a great game.  It looks and runs great.  Do yourself a favor and experience it on a PS3 if you haven't already picked one up (and no, I don't work for Sony).",Unreal is Way Too Unreal

B00083G5BW,4.0,"When I got Madden 06, I was expecting something new now that EA has destroyed the competition. But now they take Madden 2005 and patch it on to this game, add some new features and update the rosters and attributes. First, you know this is a patch of Madden 05 when you see the same bugs. When someone is traded or signed as a free agent, there career stats are erased, and most defensive players have no career stats. Also in the instant replays, there are wierd noises just like last years game.

The 2 new features is the QB Vision and superstar mode. First is QB vision. The few times I tried this feature, I was sacked. It takes too much button mashing and waiting when the blitz is coming to master. Good thing it can be turned off. The other new feature is Superstar Mode. You choose your parents using DNA, then you lead the life of a star player, from movies appearences to interviews about Madden 06. People are knocking it, but I think it is a fun new mode to a boring engine. Also,  the commentators will put you to sleep.

As for rosters and ratings, they are pretty accurate. Ricky Williams isn't in the game, but you can just create him and make his stats from last years game. Mysteriously, Ty Law cant get on the Jets, and since I love the Jets, this represents a huge problem.

To sum it all up, Madden is Madden and the gameplay is great, but one more year and it will be played out. Also, we see a trend used by EA. Take the year befores game and patch it to the current game, update the rosters and attributes and add a new mode. They did it to NCAA 06, MVP 05 and will do it to NBA and the NHL game. Lets hope in next years lineup they will take a risk and mix up the gameplay and features a little bit, because everyone and their mothers are tired of paying $50 dollars for last years game.

It's nice if parents DO want to join in or control the playlist, as the game has different menus and playlist options that are tailored specifically for them to use or that can be adapted for their children's use. This game doesn't do anything that the regular Just Dance can't; it runs on the same engine as the standard Just Dance game, and probably receives less attention than its parent game (just an observation based on the money spent on licensing music, etc.). But it is nice that they attempted to secure some tracks from very popular kids shows.

Instead, Capcom has delivered a compilation that, while worth the cost, is far from perfect.

Had each game been selectable on its own, Anniversary Collection would have been the best fighting game ever released.  Unfortunately, all the versions are essentially crammed into a single game's space (think Mortal Kombat Trilogy here), and while human-versus-human battles are as fun as ever, the computer always plays as the Super Street Fighter II Turbo characters with all their super moves and what not.  Worse yet, the CPU difficulty is set way too high on this game, so that even expert Street Fighter II players can expect to have difficulties on the easiest difficulty settings.

The addition of Street Fighter III: Third Strike to this package is nice, and anyone who did not pick Third Strike up in its original Dreamcast release should buy Anniversary Collection to add it to their library.  Third Strike is practically arcade-perfect, and arguably represents the highest evolution of 2-D fighting games.  However, next to the Street Fighter II games, Third Strike seems perhaps too evolved, incorporating too many advanced gameplay techniques and graphical geegaws.

For the price, Anniversary Collection is a must-buy for anyone who likes fighting games.  However, fans from the Street Fighter II days who want to relive the old days are advised to track down the old PS1 Street Fighter Collection discs (and suffer through their long load times) for the best old-school experience at home.","The Greatest Fighter, but Not the Greatest Collection"

B002C7TG5E,4.0,"I would have given it all 5 stars, but playing with the wiimote is useless, good thing it can be played with the classic controller. As in most wii sports related games, controls are not very responsive.
Gameplay is awesome, bought NBA LIVE 09 last christmas and never got into it. EA sports games have become dull in gameplay.
Graphics aren't the best, but gameplay makes up for everything.
Audio is also great. Its like playing on TNT, great ingame commentary.
Ingame analysis is amazing, heck they even announce the upcoming games and telecasts. Amazing!

B0013TLQH8,4.0,"granted i only got to play the demo of the game but you do get to complete a full scenario. this game is one of the few games currently available on the 360 that fills some of your rpg needs. it's a tactical/strategic rpg featuring WWII. Well it was all normal until i took control of a character named Gallant and he had the option to turn into a werewolf. The main characters all have special attack moves that do a great deal of damage. Much more so than their guns. Based on the empty slots I'm sure their special attacks will become stronger or they will develope different special attacks.

You can only equip like five items per character. I don't know if that changes or not but you can pick weapons, ammo and items off of dead soldiers which is extremely beneficial. One thing I don't like about the game is how each scenario or new information is told by non animated characters. It strongly evokes feelings of the original playstation rpgs like lunar. With the power of the 360 even with a strategic rpg i would expect something better than that. Actual gameplay graphics will pass with most gamers though. If you have your doubts i would suggest downloading the demo like i did. Based on the demo I can't find much fault with it.",Just the demo

B004L4AZ7Y,4.0,"This game is a great port of the original. Here is how I rate the game in the following catagories:

3D Effect- C-
I played the game 95% of the time with it off. While it looked good most of the time there was way too much ghosting on certain images. They really needed to spend the time to get this part of it right with it being a launch game. I feel like this was a missed opportunity as this game was a perfect candidate to showcase the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Compared to Pilotwings Resort this is a big fail.

Controls- B-
The camera, when locked in the normal position, focused too much on the ground. I always felt like I wanted to lift my head up the whole time. I was never really able to get used to it. I found myself wanting to go into 1st person view a lot to compensate which is not really necessary but becuase of the camera it made it feel like a need. Other than that the other controls worked perfectly.

Sound- D
The sound was the biggest problem with this game. It sounded like crackling through the speakers a lot. Like they were going to blow. And, keep in mind, the volume was never very loud. This was definately a programing problem.

Graphics- B+
The game is quite gorgeous to look at. It has aged well and is ported in a respectful manner here. Even to todays standards this game looks very nice indeed.

Fun- B+
I really enjoyed this game back in the day and it is just as fun now. Like I mentioned already, this game does not seem like it has aged at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. It is a very fun game. Apart from the camera and sound the game is of high standards even in terms of current day games.

3.5 stars overall.",Rayman 3D- My Review
B00FWK8UWI,4.0,"I was really reluctant to give up the beat up old HP keyboard that has carried over from several PCs before but i'm glad it did. The light effects are nice looks and it never hurts to have a lit keyboard for dark and dreary days when you don't want the lights on but need to see it. The only real issue I had was I kept hitting one key when typing and it kept messing me up, turns out it was the Ctrl key on the left side so i popped it off and now I have had no issues. It comes with spare keys that are molded clear, not much use for them but i did put them off to the side in case i need them. Overall I have seen no quality issues as all the lights work properly and the keys are comfortable to use.",Better than I was expecting.
B000WINB56,4.0,"Very calming game, love exploring the ocean and seeing all the creatures! The music is amazing, the visuals are great for the Wii, and love just exploring at my own pace. It is slow, but this is not a fast game to play, its to relax and enjoy!",Explore the depths!
B000IONGWM,4.0,"I remember playing Virtua Tennis on Sega Dreamcast back in 2000 and it was pretty fun. VT3 is even more fun and more challenging than the first VT. I like games where you can build your character. This game allows you to develop your character and even if you fail the practice session, you still get some skill points. Every time you practice or compete in a tournament, you use up stamina. When you are low on stamina, you might want to take a rest. Otherwise, your character will get injured and be out for 6 weeks. If you want to play against a friend or a family member, you can pick your character instead of choosing one of the famous tennis players.

One of things I don't like is that there's no voices in the game. Its just a text box and their lips move, but no voices. I guess you can't get all the famous tennis players in the world have their voices recorded in the game... it would of been nice though.",Fun and challenging

B0015HZLUQ,4.0,"I held off buying We Ski because of the reviews that said that it didn't make as good a use of the balance board as the skiing on Wii Fit did.  Now that I've tried it, I like it a lot and I think it gives a better feel of skiing than Wii Fit does.  When actually skiing downhill, you increase speed by crouching and by staying off the edges of your skis, not by leaning forward.  Similarly, you reduce speed by standing up to increase wind resistance and by turning, not by leaning backwards.  Holding the Wii remote and nunchuk gives the feel of ski poles.

It's a fun game.  You ski around the resort, trying different trails and taking on challenges from people you meet.  You get to choose whether it is day or night.

I found talking to people to be annoying.  They jabber on inanely while you keep hitting ""A"" to get through it.

You get a letter grade every time you go down a trail.  Sometimes I didn't understand why I received a particular grade.  Then I realized that you have to hit ""A"" as soon as the grade appears and before you get too far ahead. Then you find out what aspects you were graded on and how you did in each one.

I look forward to We Ski and Snowboard which is coming soon from the same publisher.",Ignore the Wii Fit Comparison
B000XJNTPG,4.0,"When you hear people like me say I would rather have a fun game than state of the art graphics, someone was actually listening.

Pros
This game is awesome. The storyline is great. With Jack Black, you know it is going to be funny and rock. Great music, great one liners, and fun and inventive gameplay. It is a mix of RPG style 3rd person, and RTS. Definitely an all around fun game that will keep you interested in the storyline through the end. I would recommend doing the side quests as you go.

Cons
The game is short. Really the only reason it got 4. The bad thing about these new games is their price tags. I think that definitely reflects in most of the reviews of any game. It is hard to justify spending 60 bucks for a game that you can only play for a few days. It is easily a 5 star game if you ignore the price tag.
I would like to see a better selection of things to buy from Ozzie.

They set up the ending for a sequel, but apparently the odds of that happening aren't great.

Didn't get a chance to play the multiplayer, but it is set up just like the stage battles on the main game which were actually quite fun. The main thing to keep in mind was to slow down and take your time with them.",For the gamers that like to break from the tedium

B0009S4UOA,4.0,"These are the good and bad Features of COD2

Great Graphics. (milked the 360 HD for its money)

Choppy online play if ANYONE of your online opponents/allies has a bad connection.

The storyline Is horrible.(its like all other ww2 games)

The singplayer gameplay has big jumps in skill level, for example, There are HUGE differences on gameplay between normal,easy,hard, or veteran.

The levels get a little excessive (for example on EVERY mission you have to plant bombs in a tank)

The animations and physics engine are nice (not quite half life 2 for the pc, but still good)

The challenge of gameplay on normal is perfect. Not to easy, not to hard, you will die a few times but nothing that will having you throwing your controller to the wall, and even if that does happen theres always easy (which is relatively easy)

B004DTLZMQ,4.0,"I have had hit and miss luck with these controllers. Sometimes buy one, and its good.. and will last months, before something goes a bit wonky. And then other times, it's just wonky from the start.

IF you can get one that is working great from the get go, its worth it. The controller casing has some sort of coating that makes it less likely to slip from sweaty hands in tense moments. The buttons on the right, do just like the creators said, faster response. Basically you don't have as much button to depress. And if you like the bumpers more than pressing a button on the right, you can program that button to the top extra bumper.

You'd think as much thought that went into the design, and the layout.. and the way the controller feels in your hands, that they'd fix the guts of the controller and make sure those were also the best parts they could get.
Because it really is a good concept. Its just like instead of finishing the race though, they went and .. just made it 9/10ths of the way. Stopped short of great.

It'd be cool if the engineers for this controller talked realistically about what they were intending to do.",Good Controller
B000WSE2WM,4.0,"Battlefield Bad Company is a FPS for the XBOX 360, This is an open world combat game similar to Medal of Honor Airborne and Frontlines Fuels of War. But most people feel that it must be compared to Call Of Duty 4, which of course is the best FPS on the 360.

Playing the single player campaign in Bad Company has you fighting alongside a squad of three AI (artifical intelligence). Unfortunately, your AI sqaudmates are practically brain dead! They will stand out in the open and not shoot back at the enemies. The enemy AI are shooting hailstorms of bullets at you but seldomly attack the AI squadmates on your team. This shoddy programming takes away from the realism and makes the game feel cheesy and low budget.

Since your sqaudmates are useless, that you will have to take it upon yourself to get into the combat and mission objectives. Many of the missions have intense firefights and are pretty straight foreward. The maps are very massive and open for the most part. This open world combat lets you devise your own plan of attack which is an excellent experience in itself. There are plenty of weapon pickups and checkpoints which automatically save your progress. If you get killed, you just respawn from the last checkpoint you passed.

The levels use streaming technology which means no loading times when going from one part of the map to the next. The levels also are persistant which means that whatever destruction you caused or enemies you killed; they remain the same and DO NOT reset after you get killed. The best thing about Bad Company is the destructiblility. Trees, containers, vehicles, and walls can be destroyed. The graphics and sound effects do a good job of conveying the chaos from this destruction.

There are two game mode type for multiplayer online. The mode called, ""Gold Rush""  allows up to (12) players on each team. The defending team protects the gold crates, while the attacking team tries to destroy them by either planting a charge on the crates or simply shooting at them till they blow up. Gold Rush, is so much fun that it should be renamed to ""Head Rush"".

Recently the game's developer, made Conquest mode available as a free download. Conquest plays like a cross between capture the flag and territories. It uses four pre-existing maps that have been modified to fit its style of gameplay. It is a nice addition to the overall package.

Here's a small taste of what you should expect to see during the matches:
Mortars shower from above, attack choppers dominate from the air, battle tanks destroy by ground, artillary strikes are awesome, air strikes have lethal precision. All the while lots of small skirmishes are taking place-Specialists running around with their silenced smg, Demolitionist blasting with their shotguns, Snipers killing from afar, Support providing suppressive fire and Assualt soldiers aggressively attacking everyone.

Despite some of its flaws, the chaotic battles, destructive environments, and amazing sound effects make Battlefield Bad Company an enjoyable experience for FPS fans. It is not a perfect game by any means and it probably won't topple COD4, but Bad Company certainly is one of the best open world combat games available for the XBOX 360.

Pros:
+open world combat
+destructible environments
+massive levels
+excellent map designs
+ragdoll physics
+jaw dropping sound effects
+excellent controls
+excellent vehicles
+balanced weapons
+intense firefights
+conquest mode added recently

Cons:
-brain dead AI in single player mode
-It does not win over COD4",Battlefield & Chaos
B0011BE3KA,4.0,"Or at least that's what you'll think when playing, the PS2 version at least.  I won't tell you the story because that's been said.  The controls and camera angles are what you'd expect from a Silent Hill game and if you've never played one before I'd suggest starting with 2 or 3 ( or the original I guess, if you've got a PS1 lying around.)  The graphics are pretty bad most of the time.  The video scenes in the very begining and end of the game show how good they could be, but the developers either couldn't fit that good of graphics throught all the scenes or were just lazy.

The music is as good as always and Akira Yamaoka is truly a master at capturing the essence of Silent Hill in his music.

I found the story to be pretty linear considering how good SH2's story was, and the game was short.  The Butcher came off as a cheap immitation of Pyramid Head of SH2.  He was more violent than scary and was only given two instances of screen time.  He doesn't come off as a big deal in the grander scheme of things.  And although Origins had a few fairly memorable scenes, they seemed to not linger around long enough to make an impact.

But it seems like I'm complaining a lot which is weird because I really DID enjoy the game.  I would say number 2 and 3 are better, but this one isn't bad.  It held true to the Silent Hill formula while still adding a few elements (portals to the Otherworld; breakable weapons) and I liked the changes in the firearms used.

The rifle shoots much more quickly than in SH2 and Travis can move while firing (helpful!) and the shotgun is a double-barrel rather than a pump-action, so you can fire twice in quick succession and reload in the menu.  However the ""Service Pistol"", an M1911 automatic, was incorrectly put with 9mm ammunition when it should have been a .45 caliber.  Normally I wouldn't care, but in all other rights the firearm accuracy was solid.  If anyone knows who the woman on the grip of the Redeemer is, put up a comment.

But yes, let's get back to the light level.  It's low.  The game is dark, and very much so.  I often would tap the X button just to find objects I couldn't see.  I can't tell you how often I picked up weapons lying on the ground or against a wall that I didn't even know were there.  I know it's Silent Hill and they've always been dark, but jeez!  And the grainy textures from the blown up PSP version didn't help.

But the story brough back the history of Alessa with Travis facing his inner demons in some memorable settings and managed it successfully, so is there even room to complain?  It's not as good as 2 or 3 but those were fantastic games, so this one is at least good.  And there are plenty (PLENTY) of games that can't say that.  It's a solid entry.  Silent Hill fans will love it, horror game fans would be best advised checking out one of the others.

(Note: I didn't mention Silent Hill, Silent Hill 4: The Room, or Silent Hill: Homecoming.  That's because I haven't yet played them.  I didn't mean to suggest they weren't as good as 2 or 3.  I really have no idea if they are or not.)","""Origins"" from the Latin ""dark"""

As a young thief trying to recover a magic diamond, you use your drill-tipped tank (controlled by the GBA/DS' shoulder buttons) to literally plow through doors, walls, furniture and pretty much everything else.  But you'll also have to solve puzzles and scale up platforms with your Drill Dozer while collecting microchips and gears to  make it stronger.  And the cartridge's built-in rumble pack increases the sensation of tearing your foes a new one.  Now I can look past the 6 levels of the game, and the repetitive music, and even the trigger-finger strain!  But it makes no sense whatsoever to have to pay in chips to continue if you lose!  Even if you don't pony up you still pick up where you left off, making this a pointless detriment to an otherwise amusingly unique game.

B00006AMZV,4.0,"Came earlier then I was expecting which is always exciting and it was in new condition as I had ordered.

I was looking for two player PS2 games so I could have more family fun. I found this game and being partial to Monopoly games I read its description and since our family has a wide range of game interests and this looked like it would be faster and more fun than the long lasting board game I purchased it.

I have to say it is way more fun than the board game! Everyone can roll together in party mode and take their turns and it works really well. Also you have five different board selections to play on.

B000UN3UDQ,4.0,"This is pretty simple:

Q: Do you often message people on xbox live or purchase xbox live point cards that you have to key in codes for?

If you answered, YES.  Then you should buy this accessory.  Especially since the price just dropped.  It is that simple.

The keys have a firm click to them and are pretty easy to type with.  You can't type ""full speed"" as fast as humanly possible, but you can sure punch out a message easily 10x faster than with the thumbsticks!

If you don't msg people on xbox live, ask yourself ""Do I want to?"".  Perhaps that thumbsticking was annoying you as much as it annoyed me and kept you from wanting to.  $20 isn't too terrible to make messaging easier.  It's about the price of a keyboard.

Ergonomics:
I found attaching it to the bottom of the controller was a little tricky at first.  Of course I didn't even look to see if there were any directions.  Once I figured out that you have to push it all the way until it clips/clicks into place I was fine.  I haven't had a problem playing games with the chatpad in place.

B00VMB5RDQ,4.0,"I thought I would take a chance at $60 for starter set and also got a couple of 'packs' for $20 each.  I have to say that I am as disappointed as I thought I would be.  Don't get me wrong.  The toys are cool.  The game is fun. It's awesome how you can play as Shaggy in the Wizard of Oz level, etc.  But, there is way too much of moving the toys around on the pad.  Was kinda of cool at first but, it happens a lot and by the 20th time it's just annoying.
  Now here is the really bad part:  It's terribly overpriced.  I own every single lego licensed game ever made.  What can I say?  I love them.  I was against Lego Dimensions from the start for a number of reasons.  For example, in Lego Star Wars you don't have to physically buy Darth Vader.  You can just unlock him.  We all know that's not the case with this game.  I'd have to buy him.  That's not the worst part.  The collectibles are mostly locked behind obstacles that cannot be conquered without buying a lot of extra characters. I'm only a third into the game and been to some of the worlds and I've seen the need to buy many different types of characters and vehicles (digger, jackhammer, electric, gold, silver, time travel, etc.)  Want all the gold bricks or mini kits?  Open up that wallet.  I feel that the expansions are about twice as much as they should be.  I just finished the Back to the future level in about 20 minutes.  That's including cut scenes.  Yes there is a tiny 'adventure world' and I did get an awful looking tiny delorean, very dumb hoverboard, and Marty minifig.  I'd say that's worth a max of $15.  A lot of the vehicles are cool though (mystery machine and batmobile for example).  And the Scooby world is awesome.
  Now to compare it to Disney Infinity 3.0 which is a much better game and here's why.  You buy the much cheaper starter pack if you don't have the portal thing already.  If you do, you can download it much cheaper (as I did because I don't care for clone wars stuff). Just the download gives hours and hours of stuff to do and build.  Then I bought the rise against the empire playset for $25 ($35 reg price) which gave me two figures who can level up and have different powers, etc.  Now keep in mind that the playset also gave me tons of toys to use in the toybox as well as a 4 to 5 hour fun campaign.  I can download tons of free creations to play.  I can build worlds and games.  Granted, the quality varies but, there's so much choice.  I find it hard to to believe that Lego, the most famous building toy in the world cannot include some sort of creation tools.  Inifinity 3.0 also has toybox takeover and speedway.  Both excellent.  A bit steep at $20 but still a better value than you will find here.  Now the one advantage that this has over Infinity is that I cannot play as Darth Vader in the Inside out world.  You must have a character from that franchise to play in the level.  Which is kinda dumb.
  Overall I feel that Dimensions is great for certain kinds of people:
1.  Extreme die hard lego fans.
2. Those of us with unlimited disposable incomes.
3. Those of us that aren't OCD about completion of collectibles.
4. Those that can wait for extreme sales and price drops.

As I said before, the game is fun and well made.  But, if you don't already have many of the other lego games, I'd buy several of those for the same price before I'd buy this starter pack.  You can easily get Lego Hobbit, Batman 3, Jurassic World, The movie, Lego Marvel for way less for example.  You will have several full games, worlds to explore, thousands of collectibles to unlock, and more characters than you can imagine all included.  And honestly a lot of the other lego games are just a lot more fun in my eyes.  Keep in mind that these are all my opinions.  At retail I find it impossible to recommend.  Even on sale, it's still pretty hard to despite it's many merits.  I regret having bought it and the two packs.  I could have spent that $100 much much better.

UPDATE:  It's not actually as bad as I had thought originally but, it's still pretty bad.  You can 'hire a hero' which will cost 250,000 studs after the first few.  Given that the characters are only available in previous wave AND there is only one multiplier brick (*2), this is a major pain but, a lot more fair than the way they had originally intended.  Also, many of the vehicles can be upgraded to have same abilities as a lot of the characters (batmobile has sonic and mystery machine squirts water for example).  Also, the starter pack itself has a lot of excellent levels and a lot that are not so stellar. It really was hit and miss for me where some were just outright painful where others were pure joy.  I'm raising my rating a star.  This is an excellent game overall but the pay walls keep it from being that way.  I'm also basing the review on the fact that the developer has admitted the practice was unfair and did add a compromise along with the fact that major retailers are selling the fun packs for half price.  Which is what they should have cost from the start.",Great idea turned into a reasonably bad cash grab.

B0000488VP,4.0,"Sega's famed Dreamcast console was definitely known for its wide variety of game styles. 2-D Fighters, Survival Horror, Platformer, Racer, Arcade, etc. Crazy Taxi is one of the best under the Arcade category.
However, if you are looking for a game you can play hours on end, I wouldn't recommend this one. I got bored of it in around 10-12 minutes, But rather you are a casual gamer of not, this is a nice addition to your Dreamcast library, as it is one of the classics, and if you are very short on time, you can mess around inside of the game's two well-designed worlds.
This game also has quite a humorous side. Hearing the driver and the passenger shouting back and forth betwixt each other while your driving is an experience that's very laughable.
Another notable side to this game is the music. The songs are great, The Offspring rarely fails to impress me. However, there are only 4 songs in the game. After playing the game 20 or 30 minutes, you'll have the songs memorized, and then the game starts to feel a bit more repetitive.
I myself think this game is worth buying for 15 dollars or less. If you can't find it that cheap on Dreamcast, it was ported to GameCube and PS2, and later to Xbox Live Arcade * I don't know if PSN has it*. Still, keep in mind, this game is not worth dishing out the huge dollars for, just a little cash for a quick fun ride. Just like an Arcade game.",The Dreamcast's Best Known Arcade-port

Summary: Drive around a complete city trying to unlock more cars to add to your collection. Try to accomplish barrel rolls, flatspins, burnouts (certain vehicles have a boost that you can only use if it's full, and you try to use all of it while gaining more to ""chain"" your boosts), donuts/e-break turns, drifts, jumps/air time, crashes ($$ of damage), takedowns (other drivers- online and off), and races (timed or against other drivers).
At the push of a button you can even swing online instantly to join friends, try out ""accomplishments"", or compete in races/challenges.

_The Good_

Graphics are great, the cars look amazing and reflect damage as you drive. Some cars can take a bigger beating than others, so choose carefully for races (esp. online).
The most fun I had was unlocking and trying out the new cars. And then trying to get the ""Burnout"" versions of each. Two of my faves are definitely the police cruiser and the car I received with the unlock code (GT Steel Wheels), which basically looks like a mix between the proposed new Camaro and the new Shelby.
Driving around the city is a blast, you can roam wherever you want to, just picking and choosing what events you want to do. And you can find events easily thanks to the map.

***The CRASH system is still in the game despite what you may have heard. And it's not even hidden. Just press R1 and L1 at the same time to start ""Showtime"" on ANY road.***

Half the fun of the game is just driving around exploring the city. I was able to find all the ""Crash"" gates, still working on finding all the Billboards (which you crash through of course), and I'm almost done finding all the ""Super Jumps.""

Much like the last Burnout, they've continued with different classes of cars. ""Stunt"" class earn boost quicker with tricks/jumps, etc. ""Speed"" class has the burnout boost (can only use when full). A good number of cars in this category are VERY fast, but also very weak structurally and it's a good chance it won't survive a hit. ""Aggressor"" class earns boost quicker by taking out enemies (And not only that but the bar increases in size!).

_The Bad_
Sometimes when you're online it can get frustrating if someone has a better car and continually crashes into you while you're trying to complete challenges, or worse, when you crash into them to take them out, it gives them the takedown because their car is more robust. Also sometimes you'll be driving along and think that you're going to miss a curb, only to have your car completely taken out by it. Which is a shame considering you're probably boosting at the time.

_The Ugly_
Certain challenges can become VERY difficult if not frustrating. Especially the ""Stunt Events"" which require a certain number of points. Some of the races can also be difficult if you take a wrong turn along the way. I will say that when a turn is coming up your car will turn on it's blinker and every upcoming intersection is shown on the top of the screen so you know what roads are coming up. Which is a GREAT feature.
Think you can handle the highway? Try driving the wrong way and into oncoming traffic and see how long you can last.
------ ------- ------ -------

You'll need a certain number of completed events to unlock a car, but unlocking a car isn't done until you've hunted down the driver that owns it. You have to have patience and just drive around until you see him in your rearview or he passes you on the road. Then the fun begins as you chase and run him down.

Online: this is fun once you have enough cars to play around with. The races can be tough and if you take someone out, you'll get their ""card"" with a snapshot of them. If they have a webcam or the PS3 Eye hooked up, it'll take a snapshot WHEN you hit them. Heh, nice feature (just watch out for some of the gestures!).

**Also another little tidbit of info: If you're in a challenge or race offline and mess up, just stop. This will stop whatever challenge you're doing and you can drive back to the start to try again. This will save you a LOT of time.

Overall: A lot of fun and hours of gameplay to keep you occupied. Definitely would recommend this for Burnout fans or just someone that wants to drive around exploring, doing tricks, etc. Try visting the rock quarry, or drive around the old dirt racing track (this is a lot of fun with friends online).
Also if you don't like the current track of music, just skip it with a push of a button. And if you REALLY don't like that song, go into the options and customize which ones will pop up and when. If you have a particular song you want during races, go ahead and set it up that way.

Update (Sept 26th): Trophies have been added, and for those who have completed most of it, unforunately they're not retroactive. You'll have to start a new game and go from there. Good luck and have fun earning your trophies!",Long and Fun Game

B0001YM04E,4.0,"I've never been big on first-person shooter (FPS) games, although I've played a few, like Star Wars: Battlefront 2, that I've found entertaining. So, getting this game was taking a chance, since I'm partial to real-time strategy games and roleplaying games.  Overall, I must say that I've really had a good time with UT 2004. It hasn't made me more of a fan of the FPS genre, but I am definitely looking forward to UT 2007.

Gameplay: The controls are the typical mouse, WASD keys, and hotkeys associated with FPS games, so anyone familiar with the FPS genre ought to be able to jump right in. You have a number of options for your in-game character, including race, gender, name, etc. You can also choose your AI teammates and the number on each team.  Additionally, there are ten game modes, including deathmatch, capture the flag (CTF), domination (requires you to hold two points), assault (objective based), bombing run (a deadly version of soccer), and onslaught (securing nodes and destroying the enemy base). There's fun to be had with each mode, but I suspect that most people will find the greatest replayabiity in the onsault, assault, CTF, and team deathmatch modes. The maps are large enough for some strategic thinking (especially on assault and onslaught), and the game comes with about 100 maps--with many more that can be downloaded from the internet.

AI opponents (""bots"") are very good in this game. They have strong attack scripts, good pathfinding, will follow orders, and generally work well as teams. I detected some of the typical AI cheating found in FPS games (i.e., extra health, amazing accuracy, accelerated movement) toward the end of the tournament and in some of the tougher matches, but generally the AI here is just plain challenging and well programmed. Although many will buy this game for the multiplayer side, the single-player content (which is all that I play) is quite strong. The game does not have a compelling story to tell, but the tournament mode lasted me 25-30 hours on ""experienced"" difficulty level. I don't feel a need to replay the tournament anytime soon, but there are a lot of individual maps and modes that are greatly replayable.

A few things that add a lot to the game are the variety of weapons available and the vehicles. Overall, none of the weapons are very overpowered, though some are better and more versatile than others. Some weapons are best suited for one situation, while others can be useful in some fashion under a number of conditions. A second element that adds variety to the game is the vehicles. I can't overemphasize how fun these can be. Not only do they break up the monotony of having to sprint on foot across the map, but they also add a new strategic and tactical layer to a game. Vehicles can be game winners, but they are not invincible. Some can carry multiple passengers, who can man various weapons or simply go along for the ride. However, to maintain balance, characters on foot have a few very strong anti-vehicle weapons, and many objectives cannot be completed by vehicles. Still, there's nothing like decapitating a fleeing opponent with the blades of a Scorpion buggy or hearing the thundering cannon of a Goliath tank.

The gameplay is frantic, exciting, and straightforward enough to appeal to a range of gamers. You never feel lost on the maps, since there is a good in-game mini-map and the objectives are always clear. Also, you never get the sense that you are babysitting your computer allies, since they act as intelligently--more so on many occasions--as the average human player. The game's flaws are mostly minor, but worth mentioning. First, there are a few rather frustrating missions in the tournament that the average player will have to repeat several times (at least on experienced difficulty and higher). And there is no way to adjust the difficulty level of the tournament once it starts. Also, the game-save system is automatic; the game saves after every match, win or loss. Thus, you can find yourself broke if you lose enough matches, and you'll have to play a series of qualifying matches to earn enough money to continue the tournament. It's a system that gets old quick and really adds a layer of repetition to the game that serves little purpose. Finally, some people will be put off by the amount of acrobatics that the game includes. On some of the more advanced levels and difficulty settings, AI opponents are hopping, flipping, and cartwheeling in ways that make them nearly impossible to hit, though they will seem to hit you just fine. I think that the game plays just a tad bit too fast and requires too much jumping around. But you'll get used to it.

Graphics: Great-looking game. The maps are very impressive in detail and size. Be sure to take a lot of screenshots! The models are all rendered well, from the characters to the vehicles. Weapon fire and particle effects look good, as does the natural environment, especially skies. Have no doubt about it, this is a very violent game. Dying animations are graphic, and people tend to end up in pieces or as skeletal remains. Overall, the art direction is rock solid.

Sound: Although decent, the audio is not as good as the visuals. Weapons such as miniguns and tank cannon sound like they should, along with footsteps, flowing water, and other ambiant effects. In-game AI characters tend to use the same list of taunts such as ""Ownage!"" or ""You suck!"" or ""You be dead!""--along with a few choice obscenities--but none of the characters really stand out with individual personalities. The music is the typical techno fare found in many video games, nothing special.

Documentation/Stability: The manual that comes with the game is informative and makes up for a rather bland in-game tutorial. The game was pretty stable on my computer, though I experienced one freeze and one crash during the tournament. Overall, the game seemed well polished and optimized.

Replayability: Given the number of maps that come with the game, the developer's Bonus Pack that can be downloaded for free from the internet, the large number of player-made maps available, and the editor tools that you can use to make your own maps, this game has had a long shelf life. If you get tired of playing against the AI, you can go online and play against a human opponent. For me, about half of the 10 gameplay modes are not appealing after a few rounds, but the other 5 (especially assault, onslaught, and CTF) are always good fun.

If you are a fan of FPS games, UT 2004 seems to be a must-buy (I'd be surprised if you don't already have it!). From what I have read, it is the best of the Unreal series and still has an active online community. For those of us who only have a passing interest in FPS games, this is a good one to blow some time with.",Very good game!
B014H2YSEK,4.0,"The reviews about the echoey surround sound are true. However, I got used to it that way. The default EQ settings are horrible for footsteps so I had to change my EQ settings to be able to hear footsteps better. I used the beatmode EQ settings on the astro gaming forums (google it if you want it). The echoey surround sound is very much true for this Mixamp. I still have my 2013 Mixamp and I used to prefer that Mixamp to the TR Mixamp. However, the TR Mixamp is actually slightly better for footsteps when you have the right EQ settings. You should eventually get used to hearing the echo in the surround sound. I like the convience of not needing a chat cable, because my old chat cables kept breaking with my old 2013 A40 + Mixamp Pro. So the new TR Mixamp is great in that it doesn't need a chat cable (voice goes over USB and sounds much clearer than the old Mixamps). All in all, the old Mixamps sounded better because there was no echo, so I'd only ""upgrade"" to this one if you need to. This is still a good mixamp and I recommend it ONLY IF you can get used to the surround sound echo, which might be too bothersome for many people. The first thing I wanted to do was return this, but now I like it.","Echoey Surround Sound is True, Needs adjusted EQs"

B00002SU5C,4.0,"This 1st-person-shooter game has you taking on the role of Alexander Munro (or the lovely Alexandra) an ensign aboard Star Treks USS Voyager.  When Voyager was catapulted into a distant corner of the galaxy  far beyond any hope of reinforcements  Tuvok, the ships executive officer, formed the Hazard Team, an elite corps of Starfleet commandos capable of facing any threat.  Armed with a variety of weapons and trained to operate equipment on any alien starship, the team stands ready against whatever the Delta Quadrant can throw at it.  Unfortunately, Munro is a bit too impulsive (as s/he proves at the end of the first level), and stands to be kicked off the team.  Instead, fate intervenes and the team is forced to take Munro along when the ship is snared by an alien ship and brought through an iso-dimensional rift into a vast graveyard of other alien ships.  With Voyager too severely damaged and drained of power to escape, the Hazard Team is pressed into duty - boarding other ships in a desperate attempt to learn the secret of the aliens that hijacked their ship, and to find the means to escape.  The game relies on both alien races both familiar (Klingon, Malon, Hirogen and Borg) and new.  The levels aren't too long or complicated, and a tight storyline beautifully keeps the game running.  Between the missions is a mix of cut-scenes (using the game engine, ala JK2) and interactive scenes in which you prowl the halls and lounges of the Voyager and mingle with its crew.
Theres a lot to love and to be disappointed with in this game, which is nevertheless the king of Trek games (at least until EF2 debuts later this year).  Level design is a mixed bag of great and bad  with my clear favorite being the Scavenger ship, a huge space station composed of salvaged starships like a Klingon Warbird and an early 23rd century Constitution class starship (that level excels because its such a mishmash that you never know what you're going to see next).  The game wisely starts its action aboard an Etherian starship, whose wondrous insides resemble less that of a space-going vessel than an acid trip.  Unfortunately, those are the early levels.  The game maintains its edge with an infiltration mission on a Borg cube, only to lose it afterwards, when you find you must infiltrate other alien ships manned by either sentry robots or the harvesters and reavers - vicious and robot-like aliens.  The game also has a wonderful design engine that gives some of its non-player characters a wonderful individuality (whether its your team mates or the aliens).  However, that tool, embedded within the Icarus engine, is barely relied on for the aliens  and most of the aliens youll meet are faceless and uninteresting hordes.  (The exception being that set aboard the Scavenger ship  where we hear Klingons complaining about their food, Hirogen discussing their latest hunts and humans playing an unending game of 3-D chess).  Gameplay is hampered at all levels by the games simplicity  though lightyears past Wolfenstein much of EF has you prowling the hostile corridors of enemy territory, pretty much blasting whoever you meet, and finding the exit.  (Again, the Scavenger level is best because its a stealth mission, requiring extra precision; even so, you spend so much time hiding, that you cant afford more than quick glimpses of the scenery).  The designers probably felt like they could only make a game that was either a fragfest or a thinking mans RPG, and that wed be grateful whenever it was both, for even a second.
This is actually my second review of this game, though I had to do a follow-up after having played Jedi Knight 2 which is also based on the QIII Arena engine.  Though older than JK2, Elite Force (EF) holds up pretty well.  Its not as long as JK2 (you can easily finish the game in a week after playing a level a night) nor as difficult (the enemies aren't quite as overwhelming as in JK2, and the game relies on far less counterintuitive puzzles than that game).  On the minus side, its not as challenging and the simplistic game play gets annoying really quick (instead of puzzles, you have to locate control panels, which your PDA will ID on any alien ship, and throw their switches).  There are two genuine boss-levels in the whole game, and maybe twice as many true frag-fests.  Echoing the differences between the Trek and SW universes, EF probably sees itself more as a thinking-mans shooter, but won't make you think too hard.  Though you won't need to be any kind of Trekkie to get through or even enjoy the game, fans will appreciate how the QIII engine renders their ship.
I played this on my P4 (2Ghz) XP machine without any hick-ups.  I haven't tried multi-player yet, but managed to get by without downloading the 20mb patch (which I eventually installed for the heck of it  the only difference Ive noticed is that Seven is actually voiced by Jeri Ryan).  EF isn't as finicky about your choice of accelerator cards, accepting my S3 Savage4 card.  In short, a great Trek game, and one not to be missed before Elite Force 2.",follow-up review

B0054IN5RI,4.0,"Let me break my review into multiple parts so you can get to what you are looking for in a review:

-Gameplay- 5/5
All I can say is ... PERFECTION!! The moves are solid and every character seems to be balanced. You can make a team out of anyone in the 30+ roster if you put in the hard work and minutes into getting the practice you need. The games is much different from any other fighting game out there. It is an ""open-combo"" game, meaning that if it can be imagined, it can probably be done. The button placement on the 360/PS3 controller is the best. You have Weak/Strong Punch and Weak/Strong Kick for the face buttons. The LB button is the weak and strong punch combined while LT is weak and strong kick combined. RB is dodge and RT is a sort of counter attack. That's it. The game revolves around making combos. If you want to be a pro then you're going to have to learn basics (KOF Beginner's Guide on YouTube).

-Graphics- 4/5
The only complain about this game is that the hand-drawn sprites look a bit pixelated on my 50"" 1080p HDTV. It seems the creators didn't adjust the resolution of the sprites to meet the 1080p resolution of bigger TV's when they drew them for their arcades. They look even worse when the camera zooms in on them. The stages and specials look beautiful though.

-Online- 3/5
Every online game isn't gonna play like if your opponent is sitting next to you in your couch. KOF XIII is no exception. You better hope you don't have a ranked match with someone with terrible internet speeds or your move might not come out until 2 seconds later. Other than that, gameplay is OK and a lot of fun. As of early 2012, SNK-P had added a filter system so you could avoid being matched up with someone with a Lv. 1 connection speed. The community is still alive and well so don't worry about it, specially if you live in either the far East or West of the USA.

-Soundtrack (extra credit)- 5/5
I consider this extra credit because you could only get it at Gamestop if you pre-ordered it. Well, since I didn't have the money at the time, I came here to buy it and I received the 4 CD soundtrack as a bonus. The music is UNBELIEVABLE and gives you bucket loads of nostalgia.",Best Fighting Game of 2011

B0009SQFHA,4.0,"Condemned lets you take control of FBI agent Ethan Thomas, who while investigating a crime scene with two cops in a seemingly run down and abandoned building, stumbles upon the serial killer who proceeds to kill the cops with your .45 handgun. Now the FBI thinks you shot the cops, and its up to you to catch the killer and proove yourself through brute force and forensic equipment while dodging cops and fighting crazed hobos.

Thats right, I said forensic equipment. In Criminial Origins, you'll have to use black lights, cameras and other scientific tools to find clues such as finger prints and what not. It was a pretty cool idea and really helped push the story along. Also like I mentioned, you have to fight a lot in this game (both melee and with guns), and basically anything can be used as a weapon. This means 2x4 boards, lead pipes, rifles, handguns, small locker doors, SMGs, fire pokers, axes, shotguns, and many more (all these weapons can be used to block enemy attacks as well). You battle it out with a lot of freaky and odd enemies... some look like simple whacked out hobos, others look like anorexic zombies, some are big & intimadating, others look like the Toxic Avenger. What was cool is if you beat them enough, you can grab them and smash their heads into the floor, headbutt them, or break their necks - scoring an instant kill. Oh and one more thing - you get a taser that you can shoot and disarm enemies...very useful.

The enemy AI was really good & impressive. They grab weapons off the floor or out of walls (conduits and pipes), block some of your melee attacks, take cover, and even go as far as to hide from you and pretend they are Mannequins in one stage. Additionally, if one enemy accidently hits another, they actually start to fight each other.

Theres some things to collect such as dead birds and metal pieces.. each time you collect one you gain an ""achievement"" in Xbox live..so yeah. As for the ending and unlocking anything, it doesn't.

The only two reasons this game has a learning curve is because you need to learn when to time your blocks, and to get used to the fact that whatever ammo you have in a gun is the only ammo you get for it. Thats right, you get no ammo. So lets say you have a shotgun with 2 rounds, thats all you will get for that gun until you get a different weapon or pick up a different shotgun.. it was sorta lame, but definitley helped in the challenge.

This game's difficulty varied. At some points it is overwhelming easy, and other times its just tidal wave after tidal wave of enemies running at you. But like I said, once you learn & get comfortable with the weapons & blocking system you'll breeze through it...well not really breeze, but it'll become easier.

The graphics were pretty spectacular. The hobos looked really unique, twisted, and crazy. The enviroments, though dark, where really well designed and looked really run down (which is a good thing for a survival horror game of this sort). One enemy, the last boss, looked especially weird and scary. Even the fire looked almost lifelike. To put it simply - Condemned really took advantage of the X-Box 360's hardware amd everything is amazing.

The sound effects were basically perfect. The music really helped add tension, and build anxiety while the sound effects sounded brutal and painful. Each weapon provided an either satisfying thud or bang. The enemies growls, heavy breathing and screams were really scary and added more to the atmosphere. There is cursing, which helps to add personality to every character as well. A perfect 10.

What kinda bummered me out about this title was how short it was, and how convuluted & confusing the story became in the later stages, and finally the ending. In the middle of the game, you find out that the man you are chasing is actually a serial killer who kills serial killers with the codename Serial Killer X. At the end of the game, you capture him with the help of some old guy named Malcom VanHorn,,who, it turns out, is Serial Killer X's uncle. Anyway, you have a choice whether to cap SKX or keep him alive, and no matter what you end up in a coffee shop talkin to Rosa (shes a woman who helps you out throughout the entire game) about what happened. She leaves, you go to the bathroom, vomit, and then turn to the camera looking like the last boss fight who was a monster... I was lost, and I'm sure you are too.

Either way, If you want to play a game that will freak you out while providing awesome combat, great enemy AI, and excellent graphics & sound - then Condemned is for you. Not to mention it's one of the cheaper 360 games out there.",Condemned is what survival horror is all about

B005UDTTQ8,4.0,"This game is a definite improvement on the first game in the series and adds more fan favorite transformers both as playable and as npcs.

The weapon system is revamped and improved as is the health bar and a shield has been added.  The voice acting is superb although one does miss Johnny Yong Bosch as Bumblebee. Peter Cullen as always is epic as the voice of Optimus Prime.

the biggest negative is you are no longer able to select a character out of a group of three to play through a chapter, this while annoying is endurable.  The double jump is gone but is replaced with a dash attack.

Weapons are upgradeable now and perks can be bought to improve your character using the shards you can acquire in game in from kills or from breaking cases.  Weapon selection is also improved as new types have been added and hold overs from war for Cybertron are improved.

I play with my daughters - and Eight, Ten and 12 year old. They all seem to have no issue grasping the concept and controls. It is challenging, especially on the green, were almost every putt seems to curve unpredictably, but will time I think we will be able to compensate for this.

B000RF4PLS,4.0,"I too bought this because I'm a chess player and was looking forward to having a game boy chess game with stylus control. Let's face it: chess with a control pad is awkward and slow. In this game, the control pad and buttons are strictly optional. Maybe you'd use them if you lost the stylus, which happens to some folks.

REVIEWER STRENGTH - A review on a chess game without some indicator of the reviewer's strength is worthless. So here are my indicators. On Yahoo Chess, I'm around 1300. In tournament USCF play, I'm around 1200. On Chessmaster 10th Edition for the PC, I'm around 1100.

TWO HUMAN OPPONENTS - I agree with the first reviewer, in that a two human player version in which the humans would share the DS is a no-brainer. But this is not a huge drawback to me. It is easy enough (and preferable) to simply bring out the real, physical chess set.

LACK OF WI-FI SUPPORT - Lack of WiFi support, I haven't decided on yet. One can go online in other ways easily enough, especially if one has access to free WiFi or is at home. This is a drawback, but is not huge. I bought this game as a portable computer opponent that I would use for 80% practicing and 20% training.

TRAINING FEATURES - For someone at my level, most of the training is useless. The Mate-in-One puzzles are good. But I echo the sentiments of the other reviewer in that there should be options for training & puzzles that are beyond one move deep.

PERSONALITIES - Another reviewer made the point that sometimes, this game will blunder unnaturally. I was playing a game against a 900-level opponent. I was losing, down a piece or so and down in position. I made one good move on the way to recovery. My clock was at 6 minutes, and my opponent's was at 12 minutes. The computer could not figure out a move. My move put her in check, and there were only three options. It couldn't choose one. I'm glad I had set a time limit on the game; I wound up winning on time after waiting for the computer player's clock to run down. But the personalities each have their own quirks and strengths. This is nice, as it is more like playing a human opponent.

STRENGTH OF THE PROGRAM - Serious chess players refer to this as the chess engine. A chess engine is not a simple calculator. There is a lot more to making a good chess engine. This version only goes up to Elo strength of 1850.  The Chessmaster for PC goes up to 2400 or so. Now I don't know if these are ratings that were given by actually having the engine play against a range of rated players and doing an official calculation, or if the developer took an optimistic guess. Obviously, at my level, that is plenty strong. If you are a master class chess player and you're looking for a portable chess computer, you will probably need to consider a Pocket PC and Pocket Fritz software. For the other 97% of us, this engine is plenty strong. I tested this engine by setting up a position with Chessmaster (1850 rating) having a bishop, knight, and king, and me with just the king to see if it could figure out the mate. I can't figure this out, personally.  It could. It maneuvered me into the corner on the color of his bishop, blocked off my escape, and administered the checkmate in less than 50 moves. It is easier to type this than to do it!

CHESS SETS & BOARDS - There is only one. It is 2D, and overhead view. No 3D sets and no animated sets. It works to play, but is a little more basic than I was expecting.

DUAL SCREEN FUNCTIONALITY - The bottom screen is where the action is. The board is on the bottom screen, as are the timers and options. The top screen has reference information. In games, it shows captured pieces, the name and image for each player, and each player's rating. In training modes, it has Josh Waitzkin, who makes gestures, facial expressions and so forth according to the quality of your play.

PRICING - When I searched on this before Christmas, only one Amazon retailer had it, and they were asking $50. Not bloody likely. Now, I see that it is offered at around $25. I wound up buying this locally at a store whose initials are BB. It was in the bargain bin for $15, and was the last copy. Score!  Keep an eye on the price. Since this is not the most popular title, not everyone will stock it and it may be hard to find. I would buy it for up to $30, but you can likely find it for less if you're willing to burn some gas and do some legwork.

REPLAY VALUE - This is a term gamers use to indicate whether it is fun to play the game again after you've beaten it. In my opinion, no video game has higher replay value than chess. (assuming it is strong enough to challenge you)

COMPARED TO CHESSMASTER 10TH EDITION FOR PC -
The PC version is better in every way except for one: portability. That is a big thing eh? Even if you have a laptop computer, it is big & bulky compared to a DS. The PC version has lots of sets, more useful training features, a stronger chess engine, more opponents, more timing variations, 3D options, and better sound effects. I recommend getting both of them, but get the DS version first, as it is nice to be able to play a quick game at lunch or while waiting for your wife to get ready to go, or when she drags you out shopping. :)

*** What I like ***
- Stylus control
- Strong enough chess engine
- Good personality traits make it more like playing humans

*** What I don't like ***
- Only one set & board are available; a basic 2D one
- No game library like the PC version has","This is a very good chess game, with only minor drawbacks."

B00VQFX578,4.0,"The primary reason I bought this kit was to help me determine whether it would be worth it to buy a Scuff custom controller.  The kit comes with two sets of side panels for the Xbox ONE controller; one set has adjustable trigger controls and the other set is a regular panel set.  Both sets of panels have the custom embroider Scuff logos that is raised to help give some extra grip  particularly for First Person shooter games (e.g.  Call of Duty; Battlefield, Destiny etc.).  The kit also comes with a cool little key which is used to shorten or lengthen the travel of your triggers which also donned the Scuff logo.  I would have to say that for my purpose of experimenting with this kit it served its purpose.  The side panels look great and they do provide a sense of added grip.  The trigger stops work well and all of the parts fit well  they didn't feel cheap.  This product will also get you style point as most of your friends will probably ask hey where did you get your controller?  At this price point I would have to say that this product was a very good purchase and I will probably buy a full blown Scuff controller with paddles in the near future.",Perfect if you play First Person Shooters

B00026V3V2,4.0,"I was a little. . apprehensive about purchasing this title. I like mature, adult themes in games, but this one looked at a few glances like a liiiiitle bit too much.

Now I have it and am on level 2, here is what I have to say.

The four stars I gave it should be four and a half. It doesn't get five because of its dated graphics, but atmospherically, its spot on.
The game is engaging from intro to the moment you are allowed gameplay exploration. Its a dark and sinister bloodbath in a hell hole penetentary where the main character 'Torque' is sent where the baddest of the bad fester away.

They don't hold any bars with this one. Course, strong language and violence from the word go. Its not a game for minors, though no doubt it has sold like hot cakes to minors already. I don't think it actually advocates violence like some games as notorious as manhunt. Its just that Torque has to employ the use of violence to stay alive. There are times when the decision has to be made to do good or bad, and if the choice is bad, you hear Torques wife crying for him to stop and change his ways. So in this respect, I think the moral is enforced.

So far my only real criticism is that you are better off engaging the monsters with the shiv that you get when you first get out of your cell, its in the body of a cell mate. The pistol to me is worthless, you can shoot 20 rounds into a single slayer before it falls or simply engage it for a few seconds hack and slash.

Strongly recommended to mature gamers who have the open mind for what the game offers.",One 'Hell' of a game

B00946FSIA,4.0,"Folks, let's be honest with ourselves: the Final Fantasy series has been taking a massive tumble ever since the PS1 era. With the exceptions of FF9 and FF12, the series has really been falling flat on its face ever since Final Fantasy 7 contaminated the populace. Sure enough, FF13 and FF13-2 were no-goes for me, either. I couldn't stand the staggering linearity presented in the first game, and I despised the fact that I had to pay additional money for the ending to the second one (which didn't even explain anything relevant to the plot). We can deny it all we want, but the truth is that FF has taken a turn down a dead end, and sadly, Slender is right behind it. Naturally, as a completionist, I felt it only fair to myself to grab a copy of Lightning Returns just so I could see how the story ends. I know it's hard to believe...but I was glad I did! Let's take a look, shall we?

STORY: 6/10
The absolute weakest element of the game, Lightning Returns is set more than 500 years after the events of FF13-2. How? Because the unstoppable force called the ""Chaos"" has caused the people of the world to stop aging, and the only way to die is to fall to a disease, be murdered, or take your own life. In this dark age, Bhunivelze--otherwise known as God--decides to create a new world that he believes is a paradise, awakening Lightning from her slumber in order to become the Savior, the only entity who can save the souls of the dreaded people of the ageless world. If she agrees to accomplish this task, God has promised her that he will resurrect Serah and they will once again be reunited. However, she doesn't have all the time in the world to get it done; in fact, she only starts with seven days! Lightning will have to scavenge the world for the magic force called Eradia in order to further extend the life of the world until Bhunivelze can reawaken and bring the people to salvation. I was actually very surprised with how this game's story got to the player. It's very dark, very edgy, and extremely depressing--all in which are positive for the gamers of today, in terms of JRPG plots. It never hurts to have a story that causes actual emotions to be processed by the ones holding the controller. Still, the story makes little to no sense on its own. The only things you'll really remember are the quests you will take up in order to gather Eradia to extend the planet's life. Even so, we all should know by now that when we have something good, something bad always follows.

GAMEPLAY: 8/10
A drastic improvement from the past two games, and honestly, from most of the games in the Final Fantasy series. Aside from handheld titles Crisis Core, Dissidia, and Dissidia: Duodecim, Lightning Returns is the only game that has taken the dare and decided to try real-time combat. If you were expecting the same boring turn-based battles that were practically fought for you, then you've come to the wrong place. Combat has evolved to a hybrid cross between the two formulas, giving the player the power to use attacks and spells in real-time action, but causing them to choose carefully how much of those attacks they use at one time. As you use attacks, you consume ATB with each action, and the only way to restore it is to allow enough time for it to regenerate while also defending yourself from enemy attacks. You can move forwards, backwards, and even to the side to stall for time and, occasionally, evade enemy onslaughts. You can also rely on a Guard command in battle to either drastically reduce the damage you take from enemies, or just block the attacks outright. Your performance in combat will be determined mainly by your own reflexes and reaction times; just how combat should be! The only problem is that sometimes, it's extremely difficult to predict enemy movements, and for the later enemies and Bosses, they do not telegraph their next attacks particularly well, which gives you little time to either prepare a counterattack or a block. It doesn't sound so bad...until you get to the harder parts of the game, anyway. The customization is also fairly deep and interesting, as well; Lightning can obtain a hearty number of Schematas during her adventure and equip them to not only change her appearance, but also to acquire various spells and abilities that are embedded into the Schemata itself. Weapons, shields, accessories, and adornments can be equipped to any Schemata for an even deeper level of strategy and complexity, though you'll want to spend most of the time holding on to three set Schematas: some kind of warrior, saboteur, and mage. Still, how you customize your character is completely up to you.

PRESENTATION: 9/10
Downright impressive, if you ask me. I hate to be the one to say this, but as someone who has literally played every Final Fantasy game ever released to this day, I can gladly say that this is, without a doubt, the most non-linear of any of them, and that's saying A LOT when the first game of the trilogy was the definition of linearity. The only thing about it that could be considered an issue is the fact that the game has a set time limit for each in-game day you play, and once the clock reaches 6:00 AM the next morning, you have to stop whatever you're doing and return to the Ark, which serves as a sort of ""base of operations."" But really, to anybody who complained about the time limit, I gladly redirect you to the much more demanding time limit system in Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, which gave you only THREE in-game days to do everything you could before time ran out; this game gives you a minimum of seven, and as stated before, you can extend the time til doomsday by collecting Eradia. How do you collect Eradia? By doing quests, both Main and Side. There's no traditional Level Up system here, either. No EXP, no Crystarium nonsense--none of that. Instead, every time you complete a quest of any kind, you receive permanent boosts to your stats, being HP, EP, ATB, Strength, and Magic. It may not seem like a lot at first, but obviously, these totals add up to a staggering amount by the time you finish the game (for crying out loud, your Max HP can be capped at 50,000 your first time through!). Even as there are a total of 64 Side Quests and 5 Main Quests, by the time you finish every single quest the game has to offer, you'll have plenty of time left on the clock to just have fun, run around, and explore every nook and cranny to your heart's content. Also, shortly after the tutorial, you will receive an ability called ""Chronostasis,"" which allows you to perodically stop the flow of time. So again, there's no reason whatsoever to complain about the time limit system. Once you get past the opening tutorial, you are free to roam the massive, beautiful world of Nova Cryshalis, and any quests you want to complete can be completed in virtually any order. If you somehow fail to complete the main quests by the end, don't worry; the game will automatically carry over all the stats, weapons, and armor you obtained and hand it over to you for a New Game+. The same rule applies if you did finish the game, as well. Like Majora's Mask, some quests can only be accepted on certain times of day or, to a further extent, even only on certain days themselves. Regardless, you are free to choose whether or not to take those quests in the first place. This game does a fantastic job of giving the player a sense of freedom, and honestly, it's a large breath of fresh air that is well more than greatly appreciated.

SOUNDTRACK: 8/10
It shouldn't come as a surprise. Most FF games in the series have had outstanding soundtracks, such as FF9, FF12, and even earlier entries in the 13 trilogy. In fact, some of the songs from 13 and 13-2 were apparently so good, they recycled them for this game. That's the one area this soundtrack fails, and it does so enough to only score an 8 here. Still, you'll love bashing through baddies with the music playing in the background, and you'll enjoy just casually strolling through Luxerion to the happy tune playing during the daytime.

OVERALL RATING: 8/10
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a huge wave of relief that was unfortunate to have two terrible games come before it. Still, if not for those games, this never would have been made, and that is the only reason I even acknowledge the earlier 13 games to begin with. A lot of people found petty and groundless reasons to bash this game, just because it was the sequel to a game that left us on a ridiculous cliffhanger. Those who finished 13-2 knew this day would come, and we all imagined it would suck just like the first two. But thankfully, Squeenix actually took the time to learn from their mistakes...their terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad mistakes. Is it better than most Final Fantasy games? Sure, why not. Is it better than 9? Hahaha. You're funny. Better than 7? Naturally, anything is better than 7. But what do I know, right? Buy the game and give it a shot. See what you've been missing, or what you're glad you've been missing.",They FINALLY Did Something Right!!

B00005V6BB,4.0,"The reason why this game doesn't get 5 stars is because of the following:
 1) CLIPPING PROBLEMS: Yes, I know, every FPS has them, but in this game its really bad in areas. Specifically, while I was playing the Arnhem Nights level I was walking atop a piece of rubble and somehow fell INSIDE of it. If I walked around I could see the outside of the level. Anyone who has worked with Worldcraft knows that that is not a good thing. But what was even worse, was that when I managed to jump back in the level I couldn't get to where I was supposed to be. There were several windows with the glass broken out. But the game wouldn't let me jump through them. Americans aren't THAT tall, are they? And you would think that you could blast an unhinged door out of the way--but no, it's a non-interactive object. The only way I got back to where I needed to be was by USING THE CLIPPING PROBLEM TO MY ADVANTAGE. I had to walk outside the level just to get to my proper place. Now that was pathetic. And frustrating.
 In another level (towards the end of the game) I got STUCK in a wrap of barbed wire and even in a tree once. You can not get out, even detonating your own grenades nearby won't unstick you.
 MINOR clipping problems I can tolerate, but this . . . .

 2) DAMAGE: One time, I took my BAR and pumped 5 rounds (BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!)into a German's chest at point blank range. Shortly after, this crazy Nazi gets up as if nothing more than a bee bit him and assumes his firing stance. My goodness, even the sound emmited from a BAR at that range should be able to hurt you. I often pop Nazis in the HEAD with a pistol and they STILL LIVE??? Waitaminute here, I thought I was playing Medal of Honor, not Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
 3) AMONG OTHER THINGS: Levels--and the game itself--are as linear as a railroad track. They should have made it more like Starfox (SNES) where you can pick different branches to get to a common destination. Also, I noticed some CONTINUITY PROBLEMS. You end one level with, say, your pistol, a sniper rifle, and a machine gun. But you start the next level--which is just a continuation of the last--with only your pistol. Why would any soldier just toss out two perfectly good weapons and leave himself with only a pea-shooter?
 AS FOR THE ISSUE OF BLOOD: I recall reading in a video game magazine that the makers of this game wanted to target a large audience. The best way to do that was to avoid the ""M"" rating. So they took the blood out. But seriously EA, you could easily have had a ""Blood? Yes No"" option. But no, they didn't. Don't worry, it's not that big a deal.
 Look, I know I'm making this game sound bad, so let me get to its redeeming aspects.
 SOUND: This is one of the few games that has really OUTSTANDING sound effects. The lovely and lethal sound of your sniper rifles, the drum-like beat of your BAR and the music itself, which does a VERY good job of setting the mood.
 LEVEL DESIGN: Apart from the (ahem) clipping problems, the levels are vast and varied. You'll see everything from beaches to bunkers, towns, villages, mines, hangars, docks, and mansions. My favorite level, though, was ROUGH LANDING, where you're in this beautiful village filled with towering windmills.
 HUMOR: I'm in this mansion, blasting Nazis with my shotgun. I'm in the kitchen to be precise. Well, as I walk up to this table I get a message up top that reads THE BREAD IS DELICIOUS. Just the thought of shooting Nazis while eating some good French bread . . . . Then there's this one part where you actually start a bar fight (the drinking bar, not the Browning Automatic Rifle) by pouring beer on this Nazi's head. The two Nazis start punching each other while you sit back and laugh. And finally, opening a bathroom door to find a Nazi sitting on the toilet. And yes, you can flush the toilet after you flush the Nazi out.
 HISTORY: Between levels, you'll get to see actual black and white footage of WWII, while a commentator in the background tells you what is going on so far in the war.
 Although this game doesn't escape this critic's war of words unscathed, it does come out in decent enough shape to warrant at least a medal and a purchase.",THE BREAD IS DELICIOUS

B00IVJ1M7M,4.0,"I primarily wanted this for Pokmon 3DS games and for backing them up just in case.

It does it's intended job but its painstaking that it needs to connect to the internet to do anything. Log in on the app and once you plug in a game it will always ""re download codes and power saves saves"" Everytime.

I guess that feature guarantees the developers that they themselves won't get ""cheated."" Such as trying to resell since the Key is and always will be registered under your account. Which makes it a one time deal.

It's a good cheat/backing up product of your games. But keep in mind, NOT all games will be ""backup able"" or will be supported. Trust me I've tried. If there's no cheat codes for the intended game then you canot back it up. It will say ""unsupported game.""",Cheating made simple. But could be better.
B000UW21A0,4.0,"I recently completed Drake's Fortune, finishing it within a week over about 9 hours. The gameplay is highly intuitive and easy to pick-up. The jungle and tomb settings are eye-catching and make good use of the HD format. The platforming parts are fairly easy and require little, if any, repetition. Aside from getting lost for awhile in the monastery portion about 3/4 thru, the flow of the game went very smoothly. The cinematic cut scenes are excellent. The combat system works well, allowing you the option of gunfighting or melee in most instances. However probably the only detractor in the game for me was the over-dependence on combat over platforming and puzzle-solving to provide gameplay. You kill hoardes of pirates and mercenaries in the course of the game, almost like you're playing a first-person shooter (Black meets Tomb Raider?). Overall, I recommend this as a very good PS3 offering with several solid elements: platforming, cinematics, and combat.",a solid cinematic adventure platformer
B000W2MX42,4.0,"I remember my Uncle once left SW Battlefront 1 in my house and I never even bothered to look at the game until this time that I was cleaning around and decided to see what was it about (I thought it would be a generic fps).

When I played the first one, boy did I have fun.  I decided to purchase the second one and I had a lot of fun, the game it's not perfect the Jedi animations, in exception of Darth Vader, they seemed a bit stiff, but I also liked playing with other people, I recall leaving a mine right behind me and waiting for the last minute when another guy was using a Jedi, rolling over to the last minute and seeing him getting blown by the mine, I liked little moments like that.

Its been a while since I've played it though since I've seen that there's barely people playing online but it was on Steam a while ago so I hope more people get in, also 95% of the time I played, there used to be noticeable lag, so the epic space battles do not exactly apply.",Looking forward to SW Battlefront 3.-

B00U2NE08S,4.0,"If you've played Sniper Elite 3, you've essentially played this game.  The only difference is that Zombie Army lacks much of a story line and replaces most of the living Nazis with dead and risen Nazis.  That being said, this game is very fun!  There's something satisfying about placing a bullet through a zombie's skull with a sniper rifle.  This is not a ""run and gun"" type of game.  You need to keep a slower pace and scope out the area ahead of you.  Failure to do so can result in being surrounded by a hoarde of zombies with no place to hide and an ultimate death.  The sniping element works well, the inventory management works well, the control scheme is good and the game looks pretty good.  In Sniper Elite 3, you play as one character.  In Zombie Army, however, you can choose between a handful of characters to play.

At a $40 price point, this game is certainly worth picking up.  Particularly if you've played and enjoyed Sniper Elite 2 or 3.",Sniper Elite Plus Zombies
B00006F2ZQ,4.0,this is one of the most fun and addictive games i have ever played. sme bits are annoying like when you have to do something or go somewhere and you don't know how or where. the cutscenes are interesting but also quite tedious. also the person who saves for you is raidens girlfriend so after when you save you normally get a long speech about how empty raidens room is and why he won't sleep next to her and when they met they argued over what building king kong climbed up or something like that. there are lots of plot twists and after a little while i was completely confused on whats going on. it is very interactive. its possible to kill almost anyone or anything. like it is possible to shoot seagulls that fly around in the raiden levels. also when you have to save the girl thats scared of water i accidenly used melee attack on her a couple of times which brings me onto something else. the controls are awful when im crouching down or something and i guard walks over i want to get up but i normaly end up lying on the ground which means i get a kick in the head from the guards. most of the bosses are werid like theres one called fatman who is a fat guy on rollerblades who plants explosives all over the place and before he dies he says something like laugh lots and grow fat. the characters are weird like theres a bisexual vampire who is in love a marine commander. theres otacon the weird person with glasses who had a realtionship with his mum the main character looks like a girl. on one of the levels you are walking around inside a metal gear naked and whatever you do one hand is always on his you know what. also when your naked the guards arnt afraid to kick you and shoot you. then you find out that raidens girlfriend is pregnant and your commander is ai and loads of other stuff. it has lots of annoying bits like the very long cutscenes but overall it is a very fun and addictive game well worth the money,mgs2

B001CMNJOE,4.0,"There are just so many great music games out there. While you have the guitar standards that are based on rhythm like Rock Band and Guitar Hero, and those that make you step to the beat of the music like Dance Dance Revolution, there is just the feeling of games that you have to sing your way to the top. With lackluster games like American Idol and Disney's Sing It!, just appeal to tweens and teeny-boppers wannabes alike, there just doesn't feel like there is a universal appeal to sing-a-long games alike. For those who've played Singstar so much from the PS2 and Playstation 3, the Xbox 360 has taken that notion to a whole new level that makes it more than just meets the eye.

Lips for the Xbox 360 takes in the appeal of what the Singstar! series had for the PS2, and brings in the appeal as a first for Xbox 360 players. While the game might seem like a gimmick, there actually is surprisingly more. You have the usuals like Singstar, from singing along to over 40 tracks that appeal from recent favorites like Duffy's Mercy and the extremely overexposed artist of 2008 Rihanna with Umbrella, to classics like The Jackson 5's ABC, and Everything She Does Is Magic by The Police. You also have the ability to download videos from the Xbox Live marketplace to add on to the fun. While the graphics and sound might feel like it is similar to Singstar!, as well as the concept of the downloadable content, what makes this unique to the gameplay is Lips secret weapon.

What makes the gameplay more unique is that you can plug in your MP3 player or Ipod, and connect it to the 360, and sing along to your favorite songs off their personal MP3 Players in the game as well. This feature makes the game a whole lot more exciting and addictive to the gameplay for parties everywhere. Sadly, there is one big disadvantage to the MP3 playback. The only music downloads that are compatable, are ones that are MP3 DRM-Free capable. Which is the only problem, is that if you download music off of sites that use other music files in Windows Media Audio or WMA, they will not be playable on the game. That is sadly, the only major flaw in the game. Also, I was hoping that with the price of the Singstar! games for PS2 and Playstation 3, I really thought it would also be a bit less expensive.

All in all though, Lips for the Xbox 360 brings in the singing along concept well for those who want to have a great time listening to their favorite songs. If you've gotten pretty tired of Singstar!, or if you don't own a Playstation 2, or PS3, than this would be a fantastic buy for music lovers and 360 gamers all around the world. I really hope they make this concept for more music games like this soon. At around $65, you really get a great game, that doesn't feel like it is a gimmick.

Granted, it does take some getting used to, since you have to learn how to play it and you have to learn how to use the technologies and units to your advantage. The card system was confusing at first and so were the trade routes. But after many skirmishes and countless hours playing the campaign, I can honestly say Age of Empires III is an amazing game, if you're into strategy games of course.

I really enjoyed playing doubles in multiplayer mode. Teamwork is critical in doubles mode.

B000035Y4T,4.0,"When Midway released the first Mortal Kombat to the arcades back in 1992, they probably never thought of doing a sequel. But the game was very well received. For the first time digitized actors replaced hand-drawn fighters, the action looked very realistic and most of all, it took violence in a video game to a standard that had never been reached before. It all lead to the inevitable release of Mortal Kombat II, which is widely considered the best and most original of the series.
The SNES version is probably the best home conversion available. Everything from the arcade version is included, from blood and gore to fatalities and hidden characters. The story behind the game is fresh. At the end of the first tournament, Liu Kang has managed to defeat Shang Tsung and banish him to the ""Outworld"".
Tsung's master, Shao Kahn, has restored Tsung's youth in exchange for a plan to lure the earth warriors to a tournament held in the Outworld itself. This tournament is none other than Mortal Kombat II.
MK2 introduces a host of new kombatants including Kung Lao, Jax, Kitana, Mileena, Baraka and the now playable Reptile and Shang Tsung. The original fighters return, minus Sonya and Kano. Each fighter has at least two fatalities, plus a friendship and a babality! The old guys have been polished up a bit and given some new moves to match them with the new ones. There are two brand new bosses. The first is Kintaro, who is of the same clan of creatures as Goro from the original, but is far more powerful. The second is Shao Kahn, who's insults are his own downfall.
What the MK series is really known for is the finishing moves, and MK2 manages to satisfy any lust you would have for blood! These make MK1 look tame! Especially violent are Johnny Cage's torso rip, Jax's arm rip and face smash and Baraka's blade lift. New to the series are Friendships (in which the winner shows his friendship towards the loser) and babalities (in which the loser is turned into an infant). Three new stage fatalities are present as well! Two brand new secret characters are present and will appear during the game giving various clues. They are of course, Smoke and Jade. Unfortunately you can't play as them, but only fight them.
A noticable weakness of the game is the irritating scratching sound that almost always appears when something is announced. The music is also not much in the quality department, but then again, Mortal Kombat was never known for its music. The visuals were pretty amazing for it's time, but will hardly impress anyone today. Controls, though responsive are a bit awkward. The characters tend to slide too much.
Anyway after all these years, it can still be quite addicting. SNES owners looking for worthy fighting games should pick this up. You might also want to try MK3 (but not Ultimate MK3 please...). If you are a fan of Mortal Kombat 4, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this. For the ultimate in SNES fighting games however, consider Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting.","A pretty good fighting game, at least for its time..."
B00C71034I,4.0,"There are some problems with this game, a few bugs here and there that don't kill the gameplay, it does hinder it.  I got to the point where i was not sure what to do, and just let it sit on the shelf.

B0076ZPYPI,4.0,"I'll start off by saying that at the time of this review I have played GTA5 before I played Sleeping Dogs. It's not fair to compare them because of budget and Sleeping Dogs was released a year before. I got it as a free download from Xbox Live. After letting it sit on my hard drive for a couple months I thought I'd give it a shot.

First off, let's be clear. This is definitely a Hong Kong knock off of GTA, as others have stated. But don't let that deter you from playing this game. I didn't have many expectations when I started playing this game but I have been pleasantly surprised. This game is extremely fun.

The big improvement from the GTA series is the combat. I have read that others compare it to the Batman Arkham series, which I have not played. Wherever it's taken from, it is so much fun. It makes me feel like a kung fu master. The combat is primarily hand-to-hang (or foot-to-face!) kung fu based, instead of gun based. It never gets old throwing out a few punches and then finishing off a guy with a Chuck Norris-like roundhouse kick to the face. Simply put, the combat is so much fun that I've decided to buy the Batman Arkham series.

The graphics aren't terrible, but they're nothing spectacular. I was actually expecting them to be worse than what they were. It seems like every year the graphics improve 5 years over the previous year's games so after seeing GTA in 2014, I was expecting stick figures in Sleeping Dogs. The good thing about a game like this is that there is so much action that I don't have time to sit and look at the texture on a trash can in a park.

The overall gameplay is quite fun. If you like GTA, you will like this. At the time of this review, Sleeping Dogs is available on Amazon for $15. It is definitely worth that! I highly recommend trying this game out!","GTA knockoff, but so much more!"

B000035XYC,4.0,"Yeah, I had trouble coming up with a decent introduction line.  How can I explain what ActRaiser is like?  Honestly, I don't have ANY experience with simulation type games.  This is the only one I have ever played, and it's not even completely sim according to all the reviews!  It's only part sim!

When I was a young kid and the Super NES was just released, I loved looking through the pictures in this one big gaming magazine I had, and seeing which games I wanted to buy.  This is one of the games I wanted, but for some reason, it took me 10 years to eventually get the chance to play it!  I guess this had to do with me losing interest in video games for a few years.  The spark has returned, though, so don't fear for I am BACK!

Now, as I was saying, I didn't bother with ActRaiser when it was originally released.  The type of friends I had at the time didn't think simulation type video games were cool, and since back then friendship was so extremely important to me, I ignored the game.  A part of me really wanted to play this game in the early 90's, but damn it, peer pressure!  Maybe it was for the best, maybe not.  I can't go back in the past to find out if I'd made the right decision.  I probably wouldn't have liked the game back then anyway.  It took me until my early 20's to become open-minded to things I previously wrote off immediately, so I can only assume I would have shut down a simulation type game right away, in my childhood and teenage years.  My friends were pretty cool, despite this.

I'm an adult now, and I'm finding out things about this game that I didn't know 15 years ago.  One such thing, as people frequently point out, this is one of, if not THE very first video game to mix simulation with side scroller/action gameplay.  Playing this game, it DOES feel like I'm playing something original, but I find it funny how people weren't aware of it back in 1991.  I can only guess because so many creative ideas were being thrown around back then in the world of video games, that an innovation of mixing sim with action was so small and insignificant at the time, and so people didn't care or didn't notice.

People back then were too busy having fun and throwing parties for games like Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and Zelda: Link to the Past (games that were REALLY groundbreaking) and people probably weren't paying much attention to ActRaiser's little unique features.

But as I mention above, I haven't even bothered with any other sim-type game, so this is my first and only experience with this kind of genre.  The sim parts of this game (which cover about 6 different lands) feel extremely simple.  You are an angel, and you fly around shooting monsters and building towns.  The entire point of this part of the game is to create towns and destroy monster lairs with your arrows, so you can gain points and become stronger for the action part of the game.  You also talk to people along the way, and to be honest, sometimes it's an inconvenience because sometimes they have a LOT of information they want to give to you.

But many times they give you items, important items, which can be used for either another area of the land during the town-building parts, or for the action parts of the game.  You'll eventually see that all the items the townspeople are giving to you can either be extremely helpful when fighting bosses, or extremely important for progressing to another part of the land.

The music is interesting.  I think all the best music is featured during the action part of the game, and the music that plays during the simulation part of the game can get pretty boring after a while.  The bosses you will encounter are very fun to fight, and some of them are slightly challenging, but I have yet to come across a boss that was REALLY hard.  They all have a pattern, and the pattern you need to defeat them is usually something like finding a safe place to stand, waiting for the boss to come near you, and then slash away at him, until he's defeated.  But it's still fun because the bosses have cool attacks, and they look amazing.  Don't give up if you have trouble defeating a boss.  Sometimes it takes a few tries but eventually you should find the pattern, and once you find it, you will have no problem defeating them the next time you play the game.

I especially love that boss where you are located on a series of ledges with a river behind you, and you have to face a giant flying snake.  I also love going through the volcano level.

I should also mention that during the action part of the game you aren't the angel anymore.  I guess your character is God.  Sounds crazy, but I think it's true!  I really don't know.  My game didn't come with an instruction manuel.  Supposedly you can make the bosses even easier by using some kind of special magical move on them, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet.  I mean, I know it's the A button that delivers the special move (such as a fireball, in one instance) but you collect these special moves during the simulation part, and I can't figure out how to bring those moves to the action part of the game.  There's gotta be a way!

Oh yeah, the music.  Back to the music.  If you like the music in this game check out the old rock band Genesis.  No, not the Genesis with Phil Collins as the lead singer, the Genesis of the early 70's with Peter Gabriel on vocals.  That band has music that reminds me of some of the level themes in this game.  Check out the Foxtrot or Nursery Cryme albums to see what I mean.

This game sure makes me feel all magical inside.  Maybe it's the release of the new Harry Potter movie a few months ago that got me all excited to review this game, I don't know.  But according to many reviewers, this game is unique in the way it mixes two separate types of video games- simulation and action.  The sim areas all feel very simple to me, and that's probably the point.  The action part, while containing some rather tricky jumping movements (awkward play control!) is still the part I enjoy most.

The graphics could have been better, but we can't complain about a game that came out in the beginning of the Super NES's successful run, now can we?  At the time we didn't know the system would soon release so many classics!

If this game is going for less than 10 bucks, you must buy!  There must be something in this game for you to enjoy!  I still find it creepy when I save my game, shut the Super NES off, come back later, turn the Super NES on, that angel asks me if I got enough rest.  How did that guy KNOW I was resting?","You don't like me, huh?  here's some sun to burn you, and some wind to blow you away!"

B005VBVQDI,4.0,"This is a great package. As a fan of God Of War (every single game) and after finding out that it was heavily inspired by DMC's fighting mechanics, i had to have this collection.
In all honesty, i was thrown off by DMC 1's not very user friendly interface, and just being thrown into the action without any sort of explanation and direction.
I spent quite a lot of time walking around, wondering what to do.
Midway through the game i started to appreciate it a bit more for its great visuals (even today). By the time i finished it, i realized why the game was such a hit 10 years ago (or more?) when it first came out.
DMC2 is a disappointment in many people's eyes but i liked it better than the first game. Yes, the combat is simplified, the difficulty is toned down and Dante is acting really out of character the entire game, it is still way more polished and user-friendly than the first.
The third game is definitely the pick of the crop. Amazing experience from start to finish. No complaints here. One of the best third person action games with great graphics, controls, characters and story.
Overall, a must own for anybody who enjoys games. Great price too.",Great package of timeless DMC classics
B001UU1WRE,4.0,"I like it a lot so far. I have never enjoyed Madden on XBox 360. Just seems the more realistic they try to make it look, the more the chronic flaws stand out and make it feel fake. This game has a different feel than recent Maddens. The fun factor is back. It's completely accessible for all ages and skill levels. You can have a casual game with the kids and then move on to a challenging game alone.

The game looks great and runs very well on the Wii. The cartoony screenshots truly do not reflect what the game looks like in motion. It is smooth and very pleasing to the eye. The visual style adds to the fun factor of the game. Instead of reinforcing Wii's graphic inferiority to 360 and PS3, it shows that the arcade look is still alive and well.

I can't say enough about the All Play and Intermeidate options for teaching video football to my son. The controls on Wii are so much more intuitive for children (and first timers) than on 360 or PS3. If you are used to pressing buttons that correspond to receivers, you may not feel that way. But if you've never played video football, it is very logical to point and throw. Right now he loves 5-on-5 mode with All Play controls. Over the next week or two, I'm sure he will ramp up to 11-on-11 and intermediate controls. But we will still play 5-5 a lot, it's a quick and very fun head-to-head mode.

To one of the previous reviews -- there are several modes that need an unlock code to access (Franchise, Superstar, and Situation).  Go to EA Extras, enter THEWORKS, then they'll be available.  Reortedly EA didn't hasve time to overhaul the menu system with these modes, so they will look/navigate the same as '09.","Finally, a Fun Football Game"
B0167AK9Y8,4.0,"I have enjoyed this game, but the change in game play was a little annoying. Also there is a LOT more running around and a lot less fighting and gathering of loot. I'm still working my way through it.",A decent addition to the series
B000FUG5TK,4.0,"Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia is one of the newest games to be produced by NISAmerica in collaboration with Gust Studios. The game follows the story of a young man named Lyner Barsett on his quest to save the city of Platina and the whole tower of Ar Tonelico from a deadly new strain of virus.

The game takes place in the a world that has twice met destruction at the hands of God and man. As a result only a small portion of land remains inhabitable. To solve this problem, the Tower of Ar Tonelico was constructed. The tower is composed of many sections having the poorer more agricultural folk at the bottom and the industrious technological cities towards the top.

The story begins in Platina, one of the upper cities. Here we meet Lyner Barsett, a knight of Elemia. As a knight it is his job to protect the tower from viruses that threaten to destroy their very world. When a new strain appears that is immune to all of the knights attacks, Lyner is intrusted to retrieve the Purger Grathnode Crystal from the lower lands and return to Platina. However, when his airship crash lands at the base of the tower, things become much more complicated as he meets many new people and will be forced to climb back up the tower level by level to get home. Hopefully in time to prevent its destruction.

There are only a few things that really help to define this game from other JRPG's. The most important of which being the Rayvateils. Rayvateils are basically androids or cyborgs (although they have the ability to reproduce so it has evolved into a substrain of the human species really) that have the ability to harness the spirits of songs from stones to generate powerful magic. You will meet several Rayvateils along the way, but there are two key ones that will shape the entire story (there is another, but it'd be a spoiler), they are Misha and Aurica.

You use the Rayvateils magic in battle in a slightly less conventional way than you might expect. You select the magic for her to use and she will begin casting it. She will continuously amp up the power of the spell until she runs out of MP (or you tell her to cast it) for devastating damage (you can easily amp the power to 10,000% on some early bosses). All the while you can have up to three regular humans attacking in the traditional ways.

Thus far, everything seems not to different from a regular RPG. Then you find out there is a complex dating-sim-esque mechanic that is essential to building up the abilities of your Rayvateils. Since they are part machine, there are places called Dive shops where you can go into the subconscious mind of your Rayvateil and help her work through her demons and scars from her past. By doing so, she will use the strong emotions built up and pent up to craft new spells. It isn't all that simple though because she will not let you delve into the deeper levels of her mind until she grows to trust you and your intent. By having conversations with them at rest points and a few other actions, you grow relationships with your spell casters that allow them to become more powerful. This is truely the heart of the game and is the main reason I purchased it in the first place.

Aside from the relationship system, everything is none to different from other RPGs. Although the text heavy portions for the relationship scenarios is apt to turn several people off. Unless you are a fan of bishoujo games (Japanese dating sims), some more dramatic animes or movies, or are just willing to try something unique that hasn't been done to this extent before, you may want to steer clear. But for those of us who love having things really driven by story, characterization, and the relationships between the characters as opposed to just nonstop action, I cannot recommend this game any more.","Not for everyone, but amazing if you give it a chance"

B0015HZLV0,4.0,"This was a good game. It added onto the previous game in the series by increasing the playable character count. It has the same features as the last game (except no increasing of specific character abilities) plus two adventure modes. The first is a new story made exclusively for the PSP game and revolves around Naruto and the other genin. The second is an alternate version of the first story in which you play as Jiraiya, Tsunade, Shizune, and Kakashi. The game is a must-have for Naruto fans, period; but if you are looking for a great game overall you might get bored with this. It gets repetative and most characters are basically the same.

B000930DOQ,4.0,"Sean Connery was the original James Bond. He made the mold that many have copied even now forty years later. The idea of using Connery in a Bond game was a great one. There are unfortunately some problems that hinder the experience.

The graphics are decent no where near Everything or Nothings, but a decent effort from EA. The voice acting is where this game falls apart. Sean Connery now sounds nothing like James Bond. Now he is of coarse older and has a thicker accent. That accent annoys me in every cut scene throughout the entire game. They should have just kept with the dialogue from the movie and pulled it from the archives. Some look past it, but it annoyed the hell out of me.

The game plays like EON, but the cover system doesn't work as well. There are many times in the game where you simply duck behind cover because you can't latch to it. Now that would be alright, but you still get hit when kneeling.

The levels are also a little bland using a lot of browns and blacks, but the game feels enough like a Bond game that you can forgive that aspect. The driving levels are rather forced and feel like an afterthought in this title.

The story itself basically follows the movie with some additions here and there like an extended ending. I liked the new ending and prefer it to the original actually. Throughout the game the story really puts you in the shoes of Bond and you feel like Sean Connery right down to his body mannerism and melee style.

Another great addition to game play from EON is the multiplayer. It is the traditional death match, but with added traps and even jet packs to fly around in along with vehicles.

In conclusion if you are a fan of the classic Bond titles then you will find ways to love it. Now if you are a modern Bond fan then I think you can still enjoy it for its core shooting mechanics though not perfect along with its well written story.",The Original Bond!!

B002BSA20M,4.0,"After having played the first original Halo trilogy, I was curious how HALO REACH would be. I knew the game was a prequel to HALO and that is was the last game in the Halo franchise the Microsoft allowed Bungie to develop. Since the game features a squad of Spartan soldiers, I knew that at the end of the game everyone was going to die. In that sense, the campaign mode is like watching TITANIC, you know everyone is going to die, but you don't know exactly how or where. At the same time I knew there had to be more to the campaign because there had to be a reason that the game revolved around this particular group of Spartans.

The game begins when your character, known simply as ""6"", joins the elite Spartan team called Noble. 6 is a replacement to the group after the death of a previous member. Team Noble is sent to investigate why a relay station went off line. It is suspected that rebels are the cause, but as Team Noble discovers it's actually Covenant. The team discovers that the Covenant aren't just sending out a few strike teams to Reach, but that they are planning a full-fledged invasion of the planet. The game play takes you into space as you seek to board and infiltrate a super carrier and destroy. You return to reach and assist in the evacuation of civilians and are then summoned by Dr. Catherine Halsey herself to deliver a highly important package to the ship ""Pillar of Autumn"".

As far as the campaign is concerned, I was disappointed by HALO REACH. I realize the events take place over a short period of time (just a few days). However, I was able to beat the campaign in just a few hours of gameplay. For a game that revolves around the fall (and massive battle) of one of humanity's last outer worlds, there wasn't enough action.

With that said, what little of a campaign you do get to play is exciting. Even though you know the ultimate outcome of the game, there is some mystery going on. For instance, why is Team Noble and only Team Noble sent back to the former military Sword base after it falls and is taken over by the Covenant? Outside of the original Halo trilogy of video games, I don't have any knowledge about the Halo universe and I kept thinking that maybe it's because ""Noble 6"" is actually Master Chief; that this is his origins story and the events that make him become the hero he is in the original Halo trilogy of video games.

I also really enjoyed the space fighting. It was great to actually be able to play some combat away from the surface of a planet or inside a ship and fly around and fight in a small fighter jet. That was a new element to Halo game play that I very much enjoyed.

There are some new weapons and vehicles and some other weapons and vehicles have been modified, while others remain the same as they always have. For instance, the Warthogs, Ghosts, and Wraiths are all back but they have been modified; they aren't as impressive as they are in later Halo games. Meanwhile, the old standby shotgun is the same as it always has been. I liked this retro-feel of many of the vehicles and weapons because they really look and operate like earlier versions of the forms we see in later Halo games.

Like most Xbox 360 games, the big selling point behind HALO REACH is the multiplayer experience. However, I'm really not a multiplayer person. I've played a few times with family members, and the options and advancements are impressive, but it's really not my thing.

In short, the multiplayer experience is spectacular, but the overall campaign comes up a bit short. That doesn't mean HALO REACH is a bad game, it's just not as good as it could have been.","Impressive Multiplayer, But Short Campaign"
B00001ZULE,4.0,"Of all the war games me and my sons have played.  This was by far the one of the most fun, I loved how the enemy soldiers were programmed to respond to noises and attacks, very realistic. No matter how many times we played a level trying to get off, it never got dull because the enemies didn,t respond always the same. It was very fun making mistakes,like accidentally throwing grenades at my partner or setting explosives to close and for getting to tell my partner. The only disapointment was not enough levels, but for the price this game was well worth it.",Spec Ops :Operation Fun.
B00004TNB0,4.0,"Sly 2 is the sequel to the critically well-accepted Sly Cooper and the Thevius Raccoonus. The second installment improves on Sly 1's classic design but you can now play as Murray and Bentley, both of which play unique roles in completing missions and the heist at the end of each chapter.

I won't comment on story or anything, but the gameplay is incredible. Controls are smooth, and you can pull off Sly's numerous moves with ease. Navigating the environments is easy with Sly and Murray, but I can't say the same about Bentley.

Sly is able to press the circle button to interact with numerous objects in the environment; he can climb things, balance on top of things, and overall navigate the environment in a style sympathetic to parkour. He uses his surroundings to get where he needs to go. Murray can purchase the Turnbuckle Launch early on in the game (first level). This allows him to jump incredibly high which will grant him access to the rooftops of any level in a single leap.

But Bentley. Oh, Bentley. Bentley can't do anything. No high jump, no climbing things, nothing. Comparing navigation with Bentley and navigation with Sly and Murray is like comparing navigating GTA IV's Liberty City in a car with navigating with a helicopter (respectively). Bentley is forced to take the long way around things and seems to have only been included for the purpose of frustration in navigation.

But the missions, regardless of your character, are unique and fun. Sly's recon and retrieval missions, Bentley's hacking and minicopter missions, Murray's fighting, it all comes together to provide a varied and enjoyable experience when preparing for the heist. No longer is the game relying on Sly to do everything.

The graphics are unique and overall the game looks good. Shadow and lighting effects stand out despite the overall cartoony look, proving that beauty and unique style can exist in perfect harmony. The animations flow beautifully together, but the animations in cutscenes are jerky and the facial expressions can be laughable at times.

Once you beat the game, I really don't find any joy in going back. Yes, there are treasures and clues to collect, but scouring the same environments that you've already played in just leads to overall boredom. Since this game isn't exactly new, thankfully you will pay a minimal price for this game.

Overall, this is a great game, among the best on the PS2. It isn't without its flaws such as lacking navigation, some staleness in later levels, and lack of replay value, but it's not hard at all to fall in love with this game's hilarious, cartoony, and overall enjoyable atmosphere.","Fun, not much lasting appeal"

B004X56OU8,4.0,"Growing up I loved the 2D Sonic games with ""fat"" Sonic. They were so much fun. You ran through levels as fast as you could while avoiding robots and what not. Then the 3D era began and sonic went bad. It's like Sega had no idea how to make a 3D Sonic game. Sonic Adventure was only OK and it went downhill from there. Who can forget Knuckles ""find the Chaos Emerald"" hot and cold stages? Who can forget the boring Tails and his mech stages? Who can forget Sonic Heroes? Well I wish I could. I had given up on Sonic and all his mascot friends. This game however gets it right.

First off, though all the mascots are in there you only play as Sonic. You either play as old school 2D ""fat"" Sonic or the next generation Sonic in 3D and that's it. It seems Sega has learned that mascots are boring. Secondly when it comes to the 3D stages it seems someone has finally figured out how to make a good 3D Sonic game. It's all about speed. No more slow mascot characters that take up all of Sonic's screen time. Penny Arcade once voted Sonic Adventure 2 the best Sonic game without Sonic in it.

Sega redeems themselves with this one taking the old 3D Sonic games levels and making them fun. The 2D levels are also very fun and bring back the old feel of the Sonic games of the 90's. My only complaint is that they didn't include enough of the old Sonic games levels into this one. Only two of the Genesis games made the cut, Sonic 1 and Sonic 2. It would have been nice to see Sonic CD.

All things considered it's not a perfect game but it is the best Sonic game in years. Sonic is fun again.","Should be titled ""Sonic's Redemption"""
B002I0HBZW,4.0,"Rockstar Studios is known for their controversial Grand Theft Auto series.  Last year they released the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption.  This year Rockstar released LA Noire a game set in the 1947 Los Angeles.  The studio meticulously recreated eight square miles of downtown Los Angeles along with enhanced motion capture for facial recognition.  The investment paid off.
The player begins the game as a beat cop, Marine WWII veteran Cole Phelps, who solves a series of crimes that promotes him to a detective.  From there the player takes on a series of more crimes across four different desks: traffic, homicide, vice, and arson.  Throughout the game Phelps must collect evidence at the various scenes, interrogate witnesses, and catch the criminals.
The interrogations are where the motion capture really pays off.  When questioning a witness the player can see the facial expressions and eye movements which can then lead the player to belief, doubt, or accuse that witness of lying, an act that requires evidence.  While the nuances of the actors are difficult at first, the player picks them up quickly.
After a while the player will have picked up the game's overall pattern which is where the game may take its biggest hit.  While it does take half of the game's 21 cases to arrive at monotony it hits hard when it does.  Luckily the developer spices up the latter half of the game with different tasks that stretch the breadth of Los Angeles to catch the city's worst criminals.
The action sequences (shooting, hand-to-hand, or running) are well done and easy for even a novice player to navigate.  For the most part the game is linear which lends to fewer incursions that previous Rockstar titles.  The driving sequences only got old halfway through the game as all of the cars handle exceptionally well.  The car chases became slightly annoying when the AI drivers make turns that the player couldn't make on their best day.
 Los Angeles is a beautifully recreated city.  All of the landmarks such as Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Brown Derby are especially worth seeking out in the licensed automobiles of the period.  When one is not investigating a case the player can seek out the 95 different cars or help the brethren LAPD in the 40 street crimes.
As a piece of noir it is constantly pleasing at it draws from the various pieces of noir past.  Overall the game falls just short of a true masterpiece.  There are a few plot points which won't be spoiled that prevent it from attaining a perfect score.  But that doesn't mean it is not a great game that is surely a game of the year contender and one of the best games of this generation.  It is well worth the investment and it will be 20 unforgettable hours.",Perfect Crime Game

I do wish this game would have had ship battles, but the game does revolve around using 'the Force', so I guess I can't really complain, since you don't need the Force to shoot another ship. I was also hoping for side missions, as I was such a HUGE fan of the Knights of the Old Republic games, which have a ton of side missions, but this game does not. I've heard bad things about the second series of this game, but I haven't played it yet so I can't review it.

B0013ZGPV4,4.0,"First I will say that I am an Aerosmith fan and have most of their albums on my iPod. So why am I giving this 4 instead of a 5? Mostly because it is not all Aerosmith. You have to pass songs by other bands (Which some are just covers) to unlock the Aerosmith songs. Some of the songs you have to play through are alright, but some I find, are just not very good. The good part about this game is that they have a good collection of Aerosmith songs. They have songs like Sweet Emotion, Livin' on the Edge, Train Kept a Rollin' ect. The game is just like Guitar Hero 3 only with Aerosmith as the main band. Overall, it's a good game with just not enough Aerosmith.

Pros: Aerosmith, easy to play, good collection of Aerosmith songs

Cons: Some songs by other bands are good (Stone Temple Pilots, Joan Jett, Ted Nugent) but some Aren't that fun. Not enough Aerosmith either","Good, But Could Have Been Better"
B0009FTMH8,4.0,"Generals was pretty good, but this game fills in a lot of the holes. Unfortunately, what keeps it from getting a perfect score is that it opens a few new ones.

The game adds 3 sub-factions to each major faction, generals that are styled towards a certain concept. Each general gains access to special units or powers, and loses access to other units from their faction. However, the specialization usually leaves you with pretty much one way to play, and in multiplayer games, this can be fatal if you wind up with a bad match-up.

The story picks up where Generals left off and ties up nicely, but the ending of the overall story is a bit of a stretch - normal for C&C games, but bizarre for the semi-realistic setting of the Generals universe.

The graphics have changed only slightly, having become more smooth and the environments more detailed.

Modifieds: The best thing about this game,wish they'd include some dirt tracks for modifieds
Trucks: Trucks are fun,just wish they'd include a few more truck only tracks(Myrtle Beach)instead of driving on so many fantasy tracks
Busch Series: Nascar JR You race in cars that are pretty much identical to Cup cars, except they have less powerful engines. Still again a few more Busch only tracks should have been included instead of fantasy tracks.
Cup Series: This is it. The Cup Series. The most horsepower of anything in the game. The most adrenaline. The most everything.

The only problem with this game, once you pick the settings in the Fight for the Top mode, you're stuck with them (unless you want to start new game). That's a problem because, as you progress, you'll need less and less ""driver assist"" and will want to compete agains better AI competitors (rookies, veterans, legends) and change other settings related to tire wear, refueling, damage, etc. That being said with EA's Nascar contract up,this looks like the last really good EA Nascar game.

B006V5S2OE,5.0,"This is the most responsive mouse I've ever used, both for gaming and for everyday use. It's corded, which means that you don't have the slight lag you get with a cordless mouse.  And I love the cord.  It has kind of a woven nylon or fabric covering that doesn't get tangled or caught on things like other cords. And this cord is about 6 feet long, much longer than any other mouse I've owned. It comes out of the mouse on the top left hand side so it's probably better for right handed users. I love the looks of it in the dark with blue LED lights in streaks on the top and lots of little round pin size holes on each side, all lit up blue. The surface is slick where your fingers rest on the right and left buttons and more of a matt finish on the lower side buttons which control the forward and back functions. The scroll wheel is very responsive and if you want to very quickly scroll up or down a page, just click the scroll wheel and you can move the mouse to move your cursor very fast. Left click to release it. The mouse has a good feel and the ergonomics fit my hand nicely.

Another cool feature is the little button below the scroll wheel that you can use to adjust the tracking speed. It changes color when you press it.  If the light is off, tracking is slow, 600 DPI. Click it to red and it's faster, blue faster still and magenta means it's blazing fast at 2400 DPI. The nice thing is that you can adjust it on the fly as needed for different games or within the same one. It's also takes dealing with long documents or even graphics programs to a whole new level. After using this mouse for a week or so I moved to another computer with a ""old fashioned"" mouse and I felt like I was slogging through molasses! You get spoiled very quickly with a mouse like this. It's far and away the sleekest and fastest I've ever tried.

B0007XTNGW,5.0,"This is why I think games like dark souls is easy. One of the few most agitating games ever in terms of just sheer difficulty that's just retarded lol.
But the gameplay is very deep like phantom brave and disgaea. There is a lot of gameplay elements to this, the usual rpg stuff then you can use anything as a weapon like boulders and s*** and turn objects into more troops that is just not there in most rpg games or not done to this level of detail.

It takes what disgaea has and moves it in a completely different direction, as does phantom brave basically just building off of disgaea's initial design and implementing features such as combining weapons/characters, turning people into buildings and vehicles etc the game is a nightmare.

I'd advise people who see s*** like this just go straight to phantom brave or disgaea first cuz this will piss you off the first few levels.",The hardest rpg I've ever played. Wow.

There are better devices to which some even give these out for hardly a dime except maybe the app. I do have this collection of books, and from time to time I will sit for a few minutes and read it. Like on a plane where you don't want to drag out your larger devices. That's a great time for Nintendo. Seriously, this is a decent setup, and there's nothing to complain about except maybe that it isn't worth: 44.00. I got mine for 20.00.

B00004R8XR,5.0,"I was a big fan of Tenchu 1. Sneaking around, Getting behind the guard, and chopping off his head. My main complaint about it was that it was just too short. Only 10 levels, it only took me two weeks to beat. I soon found out that Tenchu 2 was out, so, like I always do, I rushed out to get it.
I soon started playing and I was amazed. The control, while a little hard to get used to, let you do more with your character than in Tenchu 1. New things such as rolling, big jump and crawling on walls are now used. Also new, were more missions (29 in all), a third playable character, a killer level editor, and many more stealth kills. Cool.
Reviewers hammered Tenchu 2 with its one main flaw, the camera. Yes, the camera was a pain in a lot of areas, but it actually is not that bad after a while. The only time I really had problems with it was during the boss battles. Also, there is some slowdown in some of the missions, but it usually lasts for only a couple of seconds. Also the voice acting, (while better than the first Tenchu) is still very bad.
Anyway, with all the flaws aside, Tenchu 2 is a lot of fun. You'll be playing for hours just trying to achieve different kinds of stealth kills. The missions will take you a while to beat, and the replay value is great with the level editor. Pick up this and the first Tenchu. They are definitely worth your time and money.",Tenchu makes its way back on Playstation

The level challenges that these Amiibo offer are really fun!
If you are a fan of the Splatoon game you will find these really entertaining and a plus since you get the figures!

The Squid girl challenges change the main weapon for a sniper, this makes it a bit harder if you are used to the common weapons.

The Squid boy challenges change the main weapon for a paint roller, in my opinion this was really good because you get to experience these weapons.

The Squid amiibo challenges set times to some levels and you have unlimited kraken mode, to my personal opinion this was really entretaining but not as hard as other levels since you can't die.

The sad thing is that these are kinda rare and they are selling them 2 and 3 times its price, original price was 30 for the 3 figures.

B00001NTSO,5.0,"Civilization II was the first turn-based stategy game I ever played. Heck, it was the first strategy game I ever played period. And it was amazing. Take control of a civilization and guide from the dark ages all the way to the launch of a space ship to an alien world. The only way you can possibly describe a game that attempts to simulate all of history is EPIC. Civilization II was greatly loved, and with good reason. It was quite possibly the most addictive strategy game ever when it was released. So when people heard about a sequel to what many considered the greatest game of all time...
Alpha Centauri. In my opinion, this IS the greatest computer strategy game ever, to say nothing of the greatest turn-based computer strategy game ever. There is just so much to love.
First, this game is amazingly engineered. It had VERY low system requirements when it came out, and runs fantastically on a modern machine. The interface is brilliant. The graphics are clean and detailed. The background sounds are perfect. When a technology comes up, you get a voice reading about it, when you build a wonder, you get a cool movie to watch.
And there are so many ways to play within each game. You can micro-manage everything, telling your formers exactly what to do, telling every city exactly what to build, designing your own unit types. Or you can set formers, cities, and units to be completely automatic.
And of course each leader you can choose has distinct advantages and disadvantages, lending themselves to different playstyles. It would take quite a while to master every faction and playstyle in this game.
And I haven't even gone into the multi-player, the senarios, and the fact that almost EVERYTHING in the rules of the game is customizable. I believe there are about seven or eight ways to win! But of course the the harder ways take longer and give a higher score...
In conclusion I will say this. This would be a great game if it were merely civilization in space. But what makes it the best of all time for me is the story. There is a sci-fi storyline to this game, and when interacting with other faction leaders you almost feel like you're watching a historical epic with you as one of the main characters (at least that's how I felt the first time I played). I once even found myself daydreaming about conversations I was having with different faction leaders. Maybe I had just gone a little too long without sleep, maybe I was just playing a little too much, or maybe...this is the greatest strategy game ever made. Now to get back to reading the prologue I downloaded off of the offical website and download some wallpaper...",The greatest strategy game of all time?
B00GMFKYK8,5.0,"Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is finally a good game set within the lore of The Lord of the Ring. However, it should be noted that the tale isn't canon. Further, the story is fairly boring and cliche. It does shine in terms of game play. The highlight is the nemesis system which makes the game better than it would be on its own. The combat is fluid and the stealth components well done. There is quite a bit of content although some of it is repetitive in the way open world games tend to be (gathering collectibles for example). I would probably give this game a 3.5/4 but I thought I would counter some of the senseless one star ratings.",Shadow of Murder

B00004SVVN,5.0,"Before there was Madden, there was Tecmo Bowl, the granddaddy of all football games. It is known as a badge of honor whenever the phrase Tecmo Bowl is used to describe an aerial offense show by a team. The game set the standard of how the football game ought to be played plus the sheer fun of it. Of course, Tecmo Super Bowl would go on become the undisputed king of all football games; even any version of Madden, no matter what platform past or present, has nothing on it. Here in Tecmo Bowl is unique in so many ways: the legends of the game including Walter Payton, Ronnie Lott, Lawrence Taylor, and Joe Montana; the simple A and B buttons, the modified rules, the Jurassic version of play-calling, the 10 minute rapid fire gameplay, the four play playbook, the shortened game clock, and the flash of the touchdown celebration. There lies the lore of Tecmo Bowl legend: Bo Jackson of the Los Angeles Raiders. It has been a time-honored law among all players no one can be the Raiders. And what defense is there in Tecmo Bowl? But somehow, if the plays are matched up, then this results in an all-out blitzkreig; however, this is not always true that it is a sudden wasted play because a quite few players are able to get out of them successfully. Cap Bosco of the Chicago Bears is probably the most famous for being the escape artist. All in all, Tecmo Bowl will always be considered not just the greatest football video game behind Tecmo Super Bowl but the most revolutionary football game made and also one of the greatest games ever made.",Revolutionary.
B00002EPZ2,5.0,"For some reason, back when this came out I had no warning.  All of a sudden it appeared at the Video Game store.  I must say that I typically enjoy the products Black Isle puts out and I got quite excited when I saw they had released something in the Planescape setting.  I'm probably one of the few die-hard Planescape fans out there.  I own all the AD&D books and supplements, as well as the Collectible Card Game. Also, my friends and I are slowly working through playing them all!

Anyway, as for games, my favorite genres are First Person Shooters and Role Playing Games.  Once and I while I'll find a good game outside of those genres, but those typically stay my favorite, though there are naturally some flops as well.  I am pleased to say that Planescape: Torment is not the latter.  In fact this, even after these near ten years since it's release, remains as one of the top RPG's I've ever played, but that could just be my Planescape bias speaking.

For those of us out there who have gotten into playing D&D 3.5 probably won't recognize what Thaco is for, but you have to remember this is based on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules.  Regardless, it still doesn't really take away from the game play, if you're a fan of the new rules.  As far as this compares against other RPG's, I was shocked that it comes with a pre-made character.  Now you do have to choose the class, so you have options in that right.  At first I was a little skeptical, but as you go into the story-line you get really into it.

The story-line is what really makes the game.  Basically you don't know who you are and you interact with a world that you have to essentially rediscover because you have some sort of strange amnesia.  You awaken in the mortuary of Sigil, because the Dustmen thought you were dead.  In Planescape Sigil is basically the fulcrum city for access to everywhere else.  You get to visit many other planes in this multiverse setting and graphically it's all very impressive.  I thought this game really captured the essence and majesty that is the Planescape setting and they really put it together down to the very last detail.  I imagine this was immensly difficult considering how large this setting actually is.  Naturally it doesn't have EVERYTHING, but it captures the major points at the very least.  You come across other characters through your adventures that decide to join you in your path as well and you eventually grow a pretty strong party to face the higher levels.  So the game is partially a mystery, but there is a lot of action sequences where your character can choose to fight his way through.  In this the script is also very well written, which was something else that really impressed me about this game.

This is one of the closest games I've come across that's very similar to a true D&D campaign.  The negatives that some users might walk away with is that it really is only a single player game, so you can't join forces over the net like you can in games like Diablo.  Also you're limited to being the Nameless One and once his story line is over, it's pretty much done.  However, the ability to play in different classes throughout the game sort of makes up for this factor.  It was honestly a small negative for me because I tend to play through games only once then start a new and totally different game.  There are only a few games that I will play multiple times over and over.

In the end this is an absolutely enthralling story.  I logged a lot of hours playing this game and it easily kept me occupied for a few months.  I don't play games all day for long periods of time, rather I tend to play for a few hours each day, so it takes me a long time to complete epic games of this magnitude.  If you are a die-hard Planescape fan, like me, then this is absolutely a must buy and if you're also quite the connoisseur of RPG's, then this is definitely a game to look into.",One of the Best RPG's I've come across.
B00309XHD0,5.0,This game is what all the reviewers of major gaming websites are saying because this is a monster of a sequel. If you liked the first Dead Space then you will definitely like number 2. The gameplay is the same as the first game and little has changed from the first game. There are however many more weapons and suits to choose from and this makes the game better with having more of a variety of weapons to choose from. The guns are little different than what they were in the first one like the ripper is different than in the first game with having a shorter range and a bigger blade. The bigger blade makes it so you can see it a lot more clearly than you did in the first game. Another addition to Dead Space 2 is multiplayer which I do have to say is ridiculously unbalanced you fight as an engineers or a necromorph but when you fight as a necromorph you are always at a disadvantage and you won't stand a chance against the engineer team. I really like Dead Space 2 and if you liked the first game then pick this one up because you won't be disappointed.,Great Sequel

B001EM1DK4,5.0,"Have been playing the sims starting with sim tower and moving through the sims collection, sims 2 (which I loved when it came out brought a whole new dimension) and now the sims 3 is even more amazing.  Neighborhood play being able to leave your house and go about the town is great!  If you enjoyed a sims game before, you are very likely to love this game.  The new design elements are very nice.  Only issue at this time there is no option for building your own neighborhood from scratch and I do miss that.  I believe that you could take the entire town apart and start from scratch that way but I haven't tried actually doing that (yet).

It's a lot of fun.  The new features are all terrific.  Only tech issue that I've had is that if you remain idle too long, the screen gets dark and you cannot undo that without signing out of the game and then signing back on.  So if you are up answering the door and get to chatting or have to run outside a minute, you either need to play with an unattractive dim screen or restart.  The good thing is that if you save and exit, you do get to come back with the screen looking normal and your progress all saved.

I liked getting the bonus storage device with the collector's edition.  It's practical and I get a lot of comments on it!  It's a little bit extra but I think it's worth it.  The alternate town you can download for free is pretty decent too.  So at this point you choose between two neighborhoods of play.

There is an online exchange for customized items that players have created and also an online store.  I bought some things with my free points (which is nice) but have not put any money into buying from the store.  What's nice about it (opposed to item/expansion like homestuff for sims 2) is that you can buy items individually and don't get stuck with a ton of stuff you don't like.",MUST HAVE for any sims enthusiast!

B000H96C9M,5.0,"I love Warcraft 1,2,3, always have. This WOW series could have been the best game ever only for blizzard's idiot way of ruining the game by making classes way more powerful than others, destroying classes you spent forever perfecting in a single patch due to their stupid a$$hole nerfing of classes, thereby making the game supremely unfair and pointless to play for anyone who is not an op class of the month..... The subscription fee's are retarded and a complete waste of money, yes the game is enjoyable at times but not worth the fee rape. You pay 40-80 dollars for the game, another 40-60 for each major update then still have to pay monthly to pay the stupid game. Playing the game or the updates should be free, stop raping Blizzard. Everything you want to attain like gear, items, mounts, rep, achievements etc take forever (on purpose) to rake in your money of course. They set caps on honour, justice, valour, conquest so it takes two weeks min to get one piece of damn gear, dungeons take forever and get boring, after getting fully top geared in pvp gear it means nothing and is a total waste of time due to blizzard's unfair buffing of certain classes (alliance even more so) you die just the same.  For example as an affliction lock I keep gemming up and gearing up, get great damage that usually lasts a week or so the I log in as usual and my damage is a jolk, maybe a quarter of what I worked so hard to get just days prior..  This is unfair and total bs for a customer of your broken game.  Then they want to charge you 20 bucks for a unique mount?!?! wtf! The servers crash if too many people are in a major city for a raid (and you pay for the downtime too), you need other people in a raid group to do dungeons even low level raids that you can solo on a high level character so nothing can be done on your own, every time you get the best (fill in the blank) they just release a patch and make better ones rendering your useless and making it pointless to try and accomplish anything in this game. I spent a lot of time on this game to realize it completely sucks. If it were free to play after paying the outrages sums for the game and all it's extra parts it would be passable but the fact that everyone pays the same subscriptions fee's only to have certain classes benefit and other suffer unfairly is completely stupid and a waste of time. You pay to have all your work undone as blizzard wants, to complete quests, dungeons, raids as blizzards see's fit, the servers crash at random times or in a major city raids and blizzards kicks people for it, not being able to play on tuesdays so blizzard can spend an hour to all day fixing stupid crap in the game rather than fixing stuff that needs to be fixed, getting banned or suspended for doing anything other than what blizzards wants. Seems to me blizzard forgot who the customer is. Anyhow get a girlfriend, play some way better games (there are tons), save the subscription money wasted on this garbage and save it or buy something useful, and as the nerd would say ""&uck THIS GAME!!!""",Who is the customer here?!?!

B00019AZBO,5.0,"This is most likely the best MK game ever made. It has a great variety of classic and up-to-date characters, plus the graphics are perfect. Another great thing about this game are it's many different modes, such as chess kombat, puzzel kombat, and konquest mode. Just like in MKDA, you can unlock stuff from the krypt. This game even has a playable demo of midway's upcoming title Area 51, which looks pretty good. Lastly, the gameplay is flawless with each character having 3 different fighting modes, just like in MKDA.",The best of Mortal Kombat
B002TK3GYG,5.0,"This cable does the job of moving those images to the old-fashion 3-cable output TVs. However, keep in mind: The quality of data that is trasnferred from the PS3 and the TV through this cable is lower compared to that of an HDMI. So even if you have a high quality TV but are still using this cable, you may notice a reduced resolution due to the fact that you're not using an HDMI output/input.

By all means, the picture quality is still great, but if you can go HDMI I highly recommend it. The reason I'm giving this a 5-star is because this cable does its job properly, and I've had no connectivity issues.",Useful and does job

Very well done and fun to play. I would have liked batmans suit to be all black, but no big. Well worth having. GET IT!!",great game.
B00004YKX4,5.0,"There are a few games out there that can stand the test of time and replayability.  This is one of them.  The HoMM franchise has been around for some time, and fans and non-fans alike of the normally dry turn-based strategy genre have discovered that this game is a lot of fun.  Whether you're looking for a quick game, or one that will last hours, HoMM3 Complete can and will satisfy your needs.  Bottom line, this is a wonderful game.
For those not familiar with the franchise I'll elaborate.  You take control of one or more heroes within the game.  Each hero has a class (wizard, paladin, etc.) which corresponds with a specific type of town and commands an army of creatures.  Both the towns and the creatures you command go through a wide array of upgrades, and your hero/heroine can discover relics which can improve him/her as well.  In a turn-based format you strive to  conquer random monsters as you explore the expansive maps, as well as your foes who at the same time are building and fighting as you are.  Single player includes quick play based upon your settings, and mission based scenarios as well.  Game include multiplayer play as well.
So capture those enemy towns, discover the ultimate artifact, and command an army of titans and dragons!  This game is easy to learn, and quick to pick up and/or put down.  It's replayability is very high, and it's one title that will be on your system for a long time.",One of those games you can always turn to for a good time.

B0000296O5,5.0,"If this was the first FF on the playstation, it would be just as revered as Final Fantasy VII. The game battle system is not complex. If it seems like you are summoning GFs too much, stop, read the manuel, and try again. The junction system is so simple, and it lets you customize characters much better than in Final Fantasy VII or IX. It's simple, GFs, or summons, let you junction spells to improve specific stats. Then you use spells and plug it in the junction slots, the more spells, the better. With the draw system, it's easy to get 100 of a spell(with few exceptions), because you can just draw 100 from a weak enemy.
  One of the great overlooked features of this game is eliminating the RPG ritual known as ""leveling up"". In final fantasy VIII, you don't need leveling up. Just play along with the story and rather try to keep all your levels the same.
  The card game is FFVIII was ingenious. In a way, the card game makes a sort of an extra underground world for the game. NPCs sometimes seem extremely insignificant and not worth your time...until you challenge them to a card game by just going up to them and pressing square instead of x.
  The graphics in this game are both good and bad. The background is marvelous. It's impossible to come up with something bad to say about the background. The characters, in contrast were poorly done. In an attempt to make more realistically looking characters, square overestimated the Playstation's limits. As a result the characters look horrible. You can't even tell their facial expressions and they all look very ugly except in the cineamatics.
  I can't decide whether the Final Fantasy VIII story is better than VII's or not. It's certainly much more complex and not as linear. In VII, the only reason of travel was to go after Sephiroth. Here, you have a variety of reasons. You are a mercenary and you have jobs at certainly places. Other quests are due to personal reasons.
  If FF7 is any better than this, it's not much better. I hold both games dear to my heart and I think that either game will give you a very enjoyable experience.",Comparisons to other FFs ruin this game for people

B0002A6CPK,5.0,"There's an interview floating with Suda 51, the main man behind one of 4 formally Gamecube Capcom games(the other 3 being PN.03 which is only Gamecube so far, Viewtiful Joe which is multisystem now and Resident Evil 4 which has a PS2 version soon). The game was called Killer 7 and Suda answered a question about the gameplay: ""I don't know yet"". It was built from the ground up with the story/presentation and the gameplay came last, which is a big no-no in game development. May not be a typical game but boy is it something to be seen.

Story: This is near Evangelion confusing, people(maybe less so). Basically in the year 2003, nuclear energy is banned, missiles destroyed and radioactive materials are disposed of. It's a time of peace but a group called the Heaven's Smiles are here to stop it. Freaky looking monsters roam the cities and they actually explode, making kamikaze-like soldiers. In comes Harlan Smith, a man in a wheelchair who has the ability to physically conjure up his 7 personalities(think the movie Identity) who have special abilities. So Harlan must battle the Heaven's Smiles and it's leader.

Graphics: Outside of the game's great anime cutscenes, the graphics almost look poor compared to Capcom's Resident Evil 4. Hell even Viewtiful Joe. But it has a look on its own, going for a cel-shaded look but a bit less polished. Best way to describe them is stylish, not stunning on a ""wow"" scale but more on a unique one.

Sound/Music: The music in the game is basically ambience-like with some more ambitious ones thrown in. The voice acting is really superb, on par with the Metal Gear Solid games, it's just the repetitiveness might drive you nuts. Every critical hit(details on that below) and the character does a catch phrase. While it's cool to hear them going ""hurts, doesn't it?"" or the soon-to-be fan favorite ""you're ****ed"", they say EVERY time you get a hit. Also the laughter has the creepiness to it but not in a flesh crawling way, more in an impending doom way.

Gameplay: The gameplay in this game, among other things, is going to have some big debate soon. Best way to describe it is an exploration rail shooter. Basically you have a map and you walk around this map, however only on predetermined paths. Meaning you can't go anywhere, only certain areas. You press A to walk forward, if you hit a junction where you can go left or right, click which way you want and you go that way. Pressing B turns you around.

While advancing, you might hear laughter. That's your cue to stop, press R to go into first-person and press L which'll ""scan"" in front of you, revealing the enemy(ies). Some have distinct ways on killing them. For example you have to shoot one in the arms so he'll turn and his back'll have the weak point allowing you to kill it. Others have heavy armor requiring the big character. They all have certain areas which'll net instant kills, giving you blood which comes in thick or thin, thin being more for health recovery and special move meter while thick is a ""levelling up"" method.

All this talk and I don't mention the 7 characters, how silly of me. There's Garcian Smith, who can resurrect your dead party members but beware, if he dies, game over. Dan Smith can use powered up bullets for that extra kick. Kaede Smith, the only female, probably has the weirdest ability. She slits her wrists and can break down barriers or reveal secrets. She comes in handy as her gun as a scope, allowing for snipe kills. Con Smith is incredibly fast and can fit in areas the others can't, also he's blind but he has a Daredevil-like ability to find proper and hidden paths.

Coyote Smith is a former thief so he's great at picking locks. Not to mention he's an incredible jumper, reaching incredibly high areas. Kevin Smith(no, not the Mallrats director) can turn invisible and throws knives. And finally Mask de Smith, a big pro wrestler who wields grenade launchers and break down walls and obstacles.

One last thing before I close, this is NOT a game for kids. Violence and gore, sexual themes and swearing are very prevalent in this.

After Grand Theft Auto came out, there was a lot of free-roam games that came out like Destroy All Humans. Halo came out and all of a sudden we're getting those commando-like games where you're with your own army/group. Killer 7 is probably the most unique game I've seen in quite awhile. Don't let the weirdness fool you. You have to try this. At least.",An experience than a game but what one it is

I think Warlords adds good things to the core Civ 4, while Beyond the Sword adds too much junk. Civ 4: Warlords is the sweet spot of the series--not too much and not too little of the best beautiful Civ game.

B00006CRUN,5.0,"Are you completely addicted to the Sims? No? Give this new version a try, and I bet you will be soon! The Sims Deluxe Edition combines the original Sims with Living Large, plus Sims Creator for designing your own custom sims!
I admit it. I was a Sim-head. Back on my old computer, I built up a family with my copies of The Sims and Living Large, enjoying hours and hours of fun family play. But then when I upgraded to Windows XP, it didn't work quite right, I managed to lose my Living Large CD and gave up on it for a while.
Then I saw this new release become available. It contains both the original Sims PLUS Living Large's neat jobs and home accessories. Plus it has Sims Creator in it, so you can custom design your very own sims!! Add to that a whole plethora of new items, clothing, and it works PERFECTLY on XP.
I loaded it up right when I got home. My old Sim family worked like a charm, no problems at all! In no time at all I was busy customizing their home, buying them new furniture, running very smoothly. It hasn't crashed at all since this new install, and I've been playing it quite a bit!
This is great gameplay for all ages. It's very constructive - it makes you really think about your real life world. You look at the mess in your room and realize it affects your happiness, even if in some slight way that you might not normally notice. You start to get hungry and realize your energy is fading and that you're getting a bit more grumpy, something you might not have noticed otherwise! I know many Sim-fans that find their real life world improves as they become more aware of these sorts of things.
Give it a try, and see how much you enjoy being able to help your Sim families along to happiness and success!",Great for All Ages!

Quick shipping and I even got Saturday delivery. I know this section is for review of the actual product so Here goes. It synced up really easy. If the instructions that come with it are to vague you can get more detailed syncing instructions from Microsoft with a Google search. The only bad thing about syncing your 360 controller wirelessly is not being able to turn the controller off with the Home button. Again, with a quick Google search you can find a really easy software that allows you to turn off your controller with the push of a button. Very happy with my purchase.",Nice and easy
B0009VXBAQ,5.0,"The Unit

This specific set (the main unit, one Wii remote, and _Wii Sports_) is enough to get you started, but really, it should be viewed as only partial. Because only a couple games can be played with multiple people and one Wii remote, it would be helpful if one more remote came with the unit. Check for prices and you will quickly see why! It's not really a complete system with only one remote. Most people will likely want at least two.

Disabilities and the Wii

Much has been said about the Wii being used in retirement homes with the elderly, as well as with the disabled. Due to health issues, our family has now been doing activities together that we haven't been able to do in years. However, playing most of the games in a sitting position is difficult, and people who lack motor skills will have a difficult time with some functions, such as pushing buttons at once or letting go of a button at the right time. Coordination is important, and this has proven a bit of a challenge at times. When used with a wheelchair, individuals may find they need to remove the chair's armrest, which may or may not be safe for certain users.

Wii Sports

_Wii Sports_ features five games: baseball, boxing, bowling, golf, and tennis. Game play is easy and mostly straightforwardly similar to real-life play of each game. The graphics on _Wii Sports_ are cute, but not what one might expect in a game today. The backgrounds are more impressive than the ""Miis"" (little personalized icons). The baseball game even removes the arms and legs of Miis!

Some of the ""filler,"" especially in the baseball game, seems slow, and the filler can't always be skipped by pressing a button, and this grows frustrating at times. Instructions on how to play the games and what different on-screen icons mean is somewhat vague at times.

What I really enjoy is the fitness test, which can be taken daily. There are little mini practice games for each sport, such as batting practice. Once these are played, they are unlocked and show up at random in the fitness test. You can track your progress and improvement over time. This game also grows with you by saving your progress and giving you more difficult computer opponents as your skill level progresses.

Adding On

If you already have a Nintendo GameCube, you're in luck. Nintendo has made it so that much of what you have is likely compatible for play on the Wii--with the Wii operating as a GameCube of sorts. If you don't already have GameCube components, getting the Wii is also like getting a GameCube, though you will need to buy extra components to set it up as such (memory card, controllers, and games). Unfortunately, not much information is supplied by Nintendo on how this works, and it took research before I realized that the Wii remote could not double as a controller for GameCube games. On the positive side, people are getting rid of these items and they are selling for low used prices now.

At the time of this review, Nintendo has upgraded only the add-on units (such as the Wii controller and _Wii Fitness_) rather than the main unit, which is a welcome change from the way technology becomes obsolete the moment you purchase it.

Aside from games and accessories that can be added on, the Wii also has Internet connectivity that Nintendo is still (at the time of this writing) actively updating.

Overall, we have found the Wii to be a welcome unit in our home that has enabled us to have family time and lots of fun. I hope you enjoy it, too.",We're Having Fun with the Wii

B00NE5D4RE,5.0,"Just got this bundle last night. Admittedly, I have not played much of the Batman game yet. (It's pretty fun so far, though. It appears to be right on par with many of the other great Lego games.) I originally planned to purchase the Lego Hobbit bundle, but ended up getting this instead because the game is newer and will have a higher resale/trade value when I am done playing it.

This is my first PS3 console and I am SO in love! I kept my old PS2 for the longest time because I was sinking my money into my Wii and then Wii U. But, I am getting bored with my Wii U. Wii U is a great console, don't get me wrong, but there are not very many worthwhile games for it, and I am getting tired of playing the same Mario over and over. This greatly influenced my decision to finally make the leap to a PS3.

I am completely floored by the graphics of the PS3. Very sharp and clear. It puts my Wii U to shame. This bundle only comes with an a/v cord, so you will need to purchase an HDMI cable separately if you want the better graphics. Setup was a snap. Nothing complicated about it at all. The console itself seems pretty durable and stays pretty cool. It got a little warm after a couple hours, but not hot enough to cause any concern.

The downloadable Sly games that were included are lots of fun so far. However, they took FOREVER to download! Our internet is pretty fast, but it still took about 5 hours to download all three games. I downloaded a few PS1 games from the shop, and those were super quick, though. I probably won't be buying many PS3 games to download because it takes so darn long.

The 500GB console plus the included games makes this a fantastic deal for the price. To buy a 500GB console by itself costs a lot more than this bundle through most of the other retailers I looked at (including Amazon). You really can't go wrong with this bundle.

Overall, I am very happy with the PS3 and look forward to a lot of good times with it. Looking forward to catching up on many of the great PS3 games that I have been missing out on the past few years.",Awesome!

B013WDWVOO,5.0,"After spending about 12 hours of game play on this new expansion, I can confidently say that The Sims 4: Get Together is a very, VERY wise purchase for fans of the Sims. Before having this expansion, the relationships that you could have with other sims in Sims 4 were very awkward and hard to establish. You could strike up a conversation with other sims in public lots, but it felt forced and not realistic at all.
The Sims 4: Get Together introduces a bunch of new features that really make turn this game into something new and refreshing. Below are some of my favorite parts of this new expansion:
+The Club System+
The largest feature in TS4: Get Together is the introduction of clubs. Clubs are sims with like minded interests, who set up group gatherings and engage in activities. The game comes pre-loaded with some public and invitation-only clubs, which give you a general idea of how they work. For example, there's an invitation only book club that meets at the local coffee shop, but the only way to get into the club is to be friendly with all the other group members. Once you gain entry into a club, you instantly gain all the friends in it and can form relationships much faster. When playing on your home lot, you'll find yourself constantly getting texts or phone calls from members of your group, rather it's a club gathering, or a concerned friend that hasn't seen you in a while. Depending on how you interact with group members in your club, you can also influence them to quit the club, or even leave their role as leader and pass it on to you. If you feel like there's no clubs that fit your desire, you can even start your own! The amount of customization in clubs is crazy; you'll find yourself experimenting with it for a long, LONG time. So far, I have two clubs; one that meets and programs and another that meets and plays board games. It doesn't matter if you're the leader of a club or not as far as planning club gatherings. You're free to set up meetings anytime.
The new club system is what really made this expansion worth my money. It really feels so natural and showcases the true socialization features of what Sims 4 tried to show several expansions ago. I honestly can't go back to the original base game without this expansion.
+Social Gatherings+
When you get phone calls from friends or club members, you are given the choice of rather or not you want to hang out with them, the location, and if you want to bring anyone along with you. If you decide to go, you enter this 'pseudo-mini game' where the event is timed. If you leave the event early, your friends can get confused and disappointed about why you left, where if you stay too late, you might overstay your welcome. I found the timed gatherings to be very realistic and true to real life social situations.
When you go to gatherings with friends, most of the actions (ie. watch tv, order drinks, play games) all include the option of doing it together. I found this to be very useful, seeing as before you would have to make the sim do the action themselves first, and then call the sims over, one by one. Having an action that has them all go over together is so fluid and natural that I don't even think twice about doing it.
+Windenburg+
The new European based town is a very nice treat. All of the places are very well designed and beautiful. One of the things that I love about this expansion (and Sims 4 in general) is that even if you live in a different town, your sims can visit Windenburg without worrying about moving out. I love getting phone calls from group members or friends to explore a party or club meeting at a Windenburg location, just because of the sheer beauty of each of the locales.

Overall, I would highly recommend Sims 4: Get Together. This may be my most favorite Sims expansion in the grand lineup of sims expansions ever created. This game completely overhauls the game play surrounding the social side of sims and relationships. On a more personal note, I found this expansion to alleviate loneliness. It feels good to get a phone call or text from a sim, even if it is just a fictional NPC in a fictional world. It feels even better being at party, dancing the night away with friends, not having to worry about how you're going to drive home, finances, or drinks. This game takes all that stress away and lets you truly relax, all the while in the peacefulness of your home.",Transforms Sims 4 into a Whole New Game

B00002STPG,5.0,"The Konami we all know is back. Remember all the good quality games we used to get from this company? Well, Konami is trying to get back into shape, and Suikoden, the year's best RPG, is a step in the right direction. The story is simple. You are the son of the General Teo, one of the emperor's most powerful generals. Immediately, your father leaves to fight a battle up north leaving a few of his trusted friends to watch over of you. Soon after, you come to realize that you and your father been serving on the wrong side. The Emperor and his generals' minds have been brainwashed. The result is unhappy subjects and an enslaved country. Knowing this you join the Liberation Army and when their heroic leader is assassinated by the baddies, you are chosen as leader. Your job now is to recruit thousands of men to join the Liberation Army and restore peace to the country.
Suikoden is full of beautiful backgrounds (especially your castle which you can name), not to mention outstanding effects for magic spells. The music is incredible, rivaling the soundtrack of Square's Final Fantasy 3! Some of the sound effects used in spells are reminiscent of those taken off old He-Man episodes, which oddly enough sounds terrific. All this plus intricate plot twists and an inspiring storyline constantly push this game forward. Suikoden is undeniably one of the best RPGs ever made. Not only that, but Suikoden isn't a game that can be finished in a few days either. Suikoden is long (about 25+ hours) and it doesn't get boring... ever.",Another classic
B00M3D8IYM,5.0,"My review of Doom for the PS4

Pro

1080p/60fps - One thing I was worried about when Doom was shown off at E3 2015 was weather the game will still look and run good, After all we all remember what happen with games like Watch Dogs,Assassin Creed Unity and who can forget Alien Colonial Marines. After playing the game for the last couple of days I can finally say id software was true to there words. Not only does the game look good but it actually runs at 1080p at 60fps. Finally a game that runs at 1080p at 60fps that isn't a remaster (not that there anything wrong with remasters games I just fell that there so much remakes out there that its being overused).

Solid campaign - One thing Doom is know for is it strong single player mode and that continues with 2016 version of Doom. The game will take you about 13 hours to complete however it might take you longer depending what difficulty you pick (good luck with Nightmare & Ultra-Nightmare your going to need the patients for that one) and how much time you are willing to find the hidden secrets in each level.

SnapMap Mode - Similar to last year Mario Maker on the WIIU (though not the same both games do have there similarities) SnapMap mode allow you to make your own level and upload it on the internet for others people to try. If your into that kind of stuff then give SnapMap a try.

Cons

Ok Multiplayer & Season Pass- While the Multiplayer mode is fun (not to mention fast pace as well) its nothing really special. Most of mode are pretty much the same you get in other shooters games as well (like king of the hill and death match are 2 good example) and while there is a season pass for Doom. Its just for the multiplayer so unless multiplayer is your thing to me its not worth getting.

Weapon selection - While you can switch between the last 2 weapons you used (or opening up your weapon wheel selection) I find it odd that you cant assigned your to the D-pad. I mean for a game that all about being fast pace and not being a cover base shooter you would think the developers would give you the option to assigned up to 4 weapons to the D-Pad that way you don't have to open the weapon every single time.

Lack of Story - While there is a story in Doom (through data logs) I do (and Im fully aware not everyone will agree with me on this) find it a bit disappointing that the story is put on the wayside. This is an issue I had with 2011 release of Rage. It had solid gameplay and a great universe to explore but I felt the story could have been fleshed out a bit more.

Not for COD & Halo fan - If your going into this game expecting this to play like COD or Halo then youll in for a whirlwind of disappointing. Doom is not like that. Doom is all about fighting Demons, finding secrets & hidden rooms, having to find health pack (you don't have rechargeable health) and its one big selling point being gory and violent and fun. So if you are not of fan of any of that then Doom isn't for you then.

Overall -For me Doom is a blast to play. While there are some things I don't agree with (like the weapon wheel & lack of story) it doesnt prevent me from enjoying it. Being that this is a reboot I do hope it does well so we can get a sequel though.",The grandaddy of all FPS returns
B00AKIPBNS,5.0,"Fire Emblem has always been a series close to my heart.  Ever since my early explorations into the SRPG (strategy RPG) genre, I have always come back to Fire Emblem as the genre standard.  Never did Fire Emblem forget what it did best: rock solid gameplay, great story and characters, and classic intensity.  It's been a while, though, since Nintendo fans have received a major upgrade on the formula.  Despite new systems and technologies, Nintendo and Intelligent Systems seemed reluctant to put that final coat of gloss on the past few Fire Emblem titles.

Enter Fire Emblem: Awakening, the next installment in the long running franchise.  Going back to the series' roots, Fire Emblem was built from the ground up to utilize all new graphical technologies and presentation values to create the most immersive and advanced Fire Emblem title yet.  Did they succeed?  Absolutely.

First off, you'll probably notice the heightened presentation values.  Full 3D models for your characters and the enemies you fight, fully symphonic soundtrack, character voiceovers to an extent, and a multitude of anime cut scenes to tell the story.  These heightened presentation values are Awakening's greatest strength.  With these new graphical advancements, Fire Emblem has become more visceral than before: each battle features that same heart-in-throat feeling as your characters take hit after hit.  These new presentation values help bring Fire Emblem alive: each character, each battle, each conversation; FE:A's presentation values make the world jump off the screen.

Going on, a game wouldn't be any good without a great story.  Fire Emblem's ""game of thrones-esque"" story drives forward the action, while intense twists and unforgettable moments pepper the adventure.  The characters you meet, while a large cast, all have their own unique personality.  From the stoic yet loveable Frederik to the hilarious ""invisible"" knight Kellam, Awakening's cast of 30 or so shines bright as one of the reasons to see their plot through.

Fire Emblem offers a challenge to all kinds of players, from series veterans to newcomers.  With 3 selectable difficulties and the choice between Classic (where when a character dies, they die permanently) and Casual (where a fallen character is simply K.O.'ed), there is a challenge available for everyone.  New gameplay elements such as Partnering, Marriage, Supporting and New Classes offer all kinds of incredibly deep new systems without being obtuse or intrusive to the experience.  Players can fine tune their experience with all kinds of options: transparent grid, classic combat, skip animations, no voice overs; there are a plethora of options for players to tailor-make their experience, and such options (while seeming insignificant) are important as each player, as they progress through the world differently, can make their experience just as they want it.

Other elements are strong in FE:A as well: the soundtrack is gorgeous, massive, and sweeping.  It easily adapts to the story and augments the more intense moments.  Online Spot/Street-pass features are incredibly deep, offering plenty of incentive to play past the end of the story.  The 3D is also fantastic, offering a ""panorama"" view of the battlefield.  As someone who has yet to be impressed by the 3D in a 3DS title, this is the first game where I feel the 3D augments the experience, but doesn't get in the way.  The characters truly pop off the screen, fights become more immersive, and the overhead battle map has some fantastic 3D elements.  Among these, there are a handful of improvements to the formula, all augmenting the experience into something rich, dynamic, and incredibly immersive.

I could praise Fire Emblem: Awakening all day because it does everything right: Story, Characters, gameplay, challenge, online, 3D, presentation...everything is a massive improvement over the past Fire Emblem titles.  It's a massive title with a ridiculous amount of depth.  To the hardcore, welcome Fire Emblem: Awakening with open arms.  To the casual, prepare yourself for the best experience on your 3DS yet.

Where as games for the 3DS, and games in general, have dumbed down fan favorite franchises to appeal to a wider audience to boost sales, Fire Emblem rejects that entirely.  Awakening is the ""easy to pick up, impossible to put down"" title that the 3DS has been desperately deprived of.  Now that it's here, it's time to jump in.  Awakening is the best title yet for the 3DS, period!

+ Fantastic presentation values
+ Deep, new, and involving systems are refreshing
+ Intense and well written story featuring an incredibly memorable cast
+ A plethora of extra features and enticing content
+ Fantastic Soundtrack

B0012N3ZXS,5.0,"Of all the defining video games that I grew up playing, the one that bears the most relevance to me is Street Fighter II.  It's what introduced me to fighting games, as well as many others, and still defines what 2-D fighting is today.  All these years later, Capcom unleashes Street Fighter IV, which combines all the old school elements you know and love with a glossy, next-gen look and feel; and the end result is one of the absolute best fighting games on the market right now.  Very accessible yet deep and complex, Street Fighter IV brings back all twelve warriors from Street Fighter II, and throws in six new ones as well, including a powerful end boss.  The first thing you'll notice when powering up the game is that there is some seriously stylish animation and absolutely gorgeous, flowing graphics.  In fact, for a 2-D game, the overall presentation is a pure work of art in itself that looks and plays better than most current 3-D fighters.  The single-player mode is fun, but the real meat and potatoes of Street Fighter IV lie in the online multiplayer modes, even if it is occasionally laggy.  There's also unlockable fan favorite fighters like Akuma, Sakura, Cammy, and even Dan; all of which combines to offer a ton of replay value.  All in all, Street Fighter IV is a pure blast that you will enjoy for a good, long time; and is right now the best current fighting game on the market, and it wholeheartedly deserves your attention whether you're a longtime fan of the long running series or a newcomer.",Spectacular

B00009ZVI2,5.0,"This is a classical revival of the classic PC platforming game where you started in the dungeon and had to escape upwards to the highest tower to save the princess from the evil vazier.

This 3D version has exactly that type of classic platforming where you essentially go higher and higher up to the top of the tower but the focus is not saving the princess but rather returning the sands of time to the hourglass. The platforming in this game in incredible. It has a great story and presentation. The combat is not that good but you don't have to fight much in the game... and you have the use of the sands of time powers to make the combat easier.

This game is the first of a trilogy in terms of the story. This one is rated T for teen but the others are M for mature.

It takes up a small footprint and the extra USB ports on the back was a great idea which really put this charger at the top of the buy list above others. The best part is since it has the USB ports on the back they can be used for Xbox controllers as well (if you have the play and charge cable).
Getting the Move controllers into the charger is pretty simple, however they don't have a guide on them, so you may have to feel your way around a little to get them on the USB port correctly. But this is a very small setback and doesn't detract from the charger at all.

B0016BTNTQ,5.0,"The short answer: Game of the Year.

There you go, no need to read further. You're wasting valuable playing time.

For those with a bit more of an attention span: Game of the Year --- because ---

While it seems at first glance that Fallout 3 might just be Oblivion reskinned, spending a little time with this game will dispell that notion completely. Yes, it's made by Bethesda and if you've played their earlier RPGs Morrowind and Oblivion you will see a lot of similarities and will definitely feel right at home with this game. But the similarities quickly fade into mere recognizable structural convention as the player begins to see that there is a rather stout and unexpected FPS mixed with their RPG.

Okay RPG players it's not going to be all mindless or super difficult finger twitching gun battles --- you are thinkers --- well the VATS system is only one button away and you can take a half an hour to pick a limb, body, or head shot if that's how you wish to play. All the strategy of leveling up, what powers to get, weapons to get, and what armor etc. are still there --- there's even a very lite version of co-op play if you find the right characters.

And to the skeptical FPS players --- I've played 'em all --- all the Halo games, Far Cry, Bioshock etc. etc. etc. --- whatever --- and this is as smooth and solid as any of those games as a shooter. I repeat, smooth and solid. But when you want a little extra sauce on your kills, once again, the VATS system is the answer for you as well. Very satisfying slow motion ultra-gory head explosions and full utilization of the Havoc psychics engine are just a button push away. Really that's nothing but pure fun.

This is an extremely detailed and fascinating world that is brought to life with great care, ambition, and talent. Also, as simple and predictible as the story might be, I found myself actually following it and often being amused by it instead of completely ignoring it on my way to the next action sequence. I swear, I have no idea what's going on in Halo for example --- nor do I care.

And lastly, for the Fallout 1 and 2 players --- you probably won't think anything will be as good as those games. But really this game has captured a lot of the flavor those games --- while attaining a very next generation playability --- besides we need to move into this century now. Here's a tissue.

Bethesda, Nice effort on this outstanding game and also on the excellent collectors edition --- cool bobble, art book, video, and lunch box. My favorite CE so far.",Oblivion Reskinned or Game of the Year

I didn't mind this, but I know that not everyone would like to play a game where it main advertisement is a third person shooter, while most of the game is driving. The redeeming quality of this game is its narrative. It has a story that rivals that of several mobster movies out there. If you plan on playing this game, bear that in mind.

B00004KHB7,5.0,"According to Metacritic, this is the sixth best computer game ever made -- at least since Metacritic started collating scores.  Although I've played a number of games in Metacritic's top 20, several of them, I felt, did not live up to the hype.  This one did.  You only have to play it for a few days to realize why it has the reputation it does.  It's infinitely interesting with balanced, well-paced gameplay.

Other games you're definitely wanting to get through, to finish.  This is one I can honestly say I wished wouldn't end.

To be sure, this game is old:  released about 2000.  But you know how people say they'll take a game with killer gameplay over a game with superior graphics any day?  Well, this game is the primo example of that.  As soon as you fire it up, you'll think, ""Oh, sheesh.  This this is old.  Do I really wanna play this?""  A couple of hours later, you won't even notice.

Granted, there are some things I'd change about it, ranging from programming eyesores (e.g., in the middle of a battle, one of your PCs will wander off in the opposite direction) to gameplay issues (tons of dialogue , much of it repetitive).

Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is an entirely different story for me. This game is amazing and really shows the power of my new investment in gaming, the New Nintendo 3DS XL.

From the first seconds of the intro, the story immediately sucked me in. Two titans known as the Bionis and Mechonis are locked in battle for an eternity, which ends in a stalemate between them with both titan's blades piercing the other titan. Eons later, these colossal beings' dead bodies have given rise to civilisations, one being biological in nature, the other mechanical. These civilizations are now locked in an eternal battle just as their gods were before them. The story is phenomenal, and just so full of that magic that makes a history interesting. I rate the story thus far as 5/5 stars.

The art in Xenoblade Chronicles is amazing, and I feel like it really fits the universe and history they crafted here. The fields you explore are massive, filled with life, and seemingly endless. The wildlife and denizens of XBC are full of character, and much of the time I feel as though I am actually peering into an excellently devised alternate world. According to editorial reviews, I am in the minority of people who believe that this game looks even better with the 3D Volume slider in the fully activated position. 5/5 stars for the amazing art in this game.

Sound wise, this game truly shines. I plug in headphones to play, and the music just sucks me into this amazing setting, and I get lost just wandering around listening to the music. For people like me who really enjoy the music, a jukebox feature is included. This allows you to plug in headphones, play a track, close your 3ds and get lost in the music. SFX fare equally well in this game, and I have noticed specifically that a great deal of attention was paid to making every sound as realistic as possible. Grass rustles as you run through it, animals each have their own unique calls and cries, weapons make a satisfying sound upon unsheathing, attacking, and resheathing, and the whole thing just sounds great. I have one nitpick, and that is the British voice acting being over the top some times. Its a minor flaw in an otherwise perfect game. 5/5 stars for sound design.

The most important factor in a game review for me is gameplay. Xenonlade Chronicles 3D excels for the most part, and the combat system really shines. Your character will autoattack as long as the enemy is within range of the attack. You activate specials to do major damage (or heal your team) and those then have a cooldown period in order to eliminate button spamming. I really enjoy the flow of combat, though I will complain that the wholes system absolutely feels 5 years old (as that's how old this game is), but the gameplay is as solid as I'm sure it was 5 years ago. Also, if you plan on playing this game, prepare for a very lengthy adventure. You will not beat this game in a weekend, or even a week. Expect to get 70-80 hours plus out of your first play through. I have not yet finished the game, but am already 56 hours in. Gameplay is 4.75/5 stars.

Overall, I highly recommend this title, if you have the hardware to support it. I wouldn't say this game is a system seller, but it is definitely a great showcase for the technical prowess of the New Nintendo 3DS console. If you've never played the original though, you may have no reason to play this version. I rate this game a solid 5/5 stars, and that's coming from someone who despises the very idea of JRPG titles. I prefer more traditional western games (shooters, horror, and Zelda), but this game has managed to pull me in like I never thought it would. If a friend hadn't suggested it, I would've never even thought about it. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a game to fall in love with, and just impresses me every time I boot it up.",It's Reyn Time!

B00FUC6SZO,5.0,Maybe my favorite game since Final Fantasy 7.  I wish I had the time to invest like I did when I was younger with FF7.  There is so much to explore and so much of the storyline to go through.  The side quests seem infinite.  I think they will continue to release DLC for this game the next few years which will add even more to the game.  The gameplay does have some getting use to and can be quite challenging.  You die a lot in this game.  There is an auto save option but I save the game manual frequently.  I have a feeling this game will give you at least a good 6 months to a year of gameplay.,Incredible game
B00ZQ17PL0,5.0,"This collection contains all released content for the first four numbered Halo games. That's about 50 campaign missions (you can also download the Halo 3 ODST spin-off campaign for $5) and three times that many multiplayer maps, all operating at 1080P and 60 frames per second, with split-screen cooperative and competitive multiplayer.

Note: I've not owned this for very long and have not experienced the multiplayer issues that many did earlier in this game's life. I can only say that I think these issues are gone and I haven't experienced them.

The sheer amount of content and options is staggering, and while the interface layout in the menus is organized, it's still easy to get lost in the minutiae, and some of the text can be small and hard to read.

For those who are considering picking this up to see what all the fuss has been about this franchise for the last 15 years, Halo chronicles the journey of the eponymous Master Chief, a highly trained and modified human super-soldier, who is awoken in interstellar travel to fight against the Covenant, an amalgam of hostile aliens who've been battling (and winning) humans for decades.

The gameplay was renowned for the introduction of regenerating health, by virtue of his personal shielding, limiting on-person arsenals (the chief can only carry two weapons and some grenades at a time, with some variation), vehicular combat, and still impressive required tactical approaches due to enemy squad compositions and the previously mentioned limited arsenal.

While the story can be obtuse at times and isn't always greatly fleshed out in game, the actors are spot on, and the overarching plot and its religious themes are interesting and thoughtful in ways few shooters, or other games, are.

Most will buy this for nostalgic reasons (like me) and will know precisely what you want to relive in the package. For me, replaying the original Halo CE with my son was the big draw, and the reworked assets from the engine, art, and sound all help to preserve the joy that I had first playing it almost 15 years ago, while the ability to change control schemes and all manner of other options help to draw in a younger crowd to what could feel and look very dated.

The sound deserves a special shout-out. Marty O'Donnel's soundtracks for the first three games are outstanding and varied and great lengths have been taken to improve the sound design from the older titles into punchier, more immersive versions of the already distinctive cacophony of  Halo's futuristic battles.

The game to game changes have still been preserved, and you'll notice different feels to weapons, opponents, and movement. If you loved Halo 2's multiplayer, you can jump in to only that game's playlist. If you want smorgasbord of the series's offerings, there's a playlist for that as well, but the slight variations in feel can take some getting used to match-to-match.

Due to the amount of lovingly preserved and modernized content, this should be purchased by any shooter fan who owns an Xbox One, and not just Halo fans of old (or old Halo fans, like me).",Tons of masterwork content

B0018YXM3Y,5.0,"If your not familair with the series, this a hybrid game, turn based on the global map and real-time during land and naval battles.  The game is semi-historical in that you play the actual empires of that period while dealing with the unique issues that they dealt with.  You goal is to conquer a certain number of regions or gain a certain number of prestiege points.  The time period is 1700-1799.  The game graphics are incrediable, but to get the most out of the graphics I suggest a beefy rig.  Your playing field is Europe to Americas to India.  This is epic game play!  If you are a gamer who wants to play something real quick after work to blow out some stress, then I suggest you get a PS3 or 360 game.  This is hard core strategy and it will take days if not weeks depending on your play style to finish a campaign ( and keep in mind that is with just one nation, you can try the others for a complete different set of experiences)

I enjoy the empire building and battles and I usually ignore the diplomacy and espionage side of games, but in this game diplomacy is key to victory!  You just can't build tons of armies and move them all over the place, you need to secure your borders with diplomacy while your limited armies and generals are fighting somewhere else.  Also this game does a great job of making you not treat your units like fodder.  Units cost a lot.  So getting a whole army destroyed will hurt, hurt real bad.
So this makes you approach battles with caution (as it should be) Your unit also get veteran status as they get combat experience, this experience is critical (kind of takes on a role playing aspect)so you want your good units and generals to survive.

They recently released a major patch (4/29/09) it fixes all the release bugs and improves some other things.  The AI still needs some additional fine tuning but it is more than a challenge.  Put it on Hard/Hard that feels about right.  I think when the next patch comes out in about 6 weeks or so this could be the finest strategy game ever produced.  And I own A LOT OF STRATEGY GAMES.

So to conclude, if you like your games long and epic, you have a passion for history and you find thinking more fun over reflexes this is your game.",Empire Total War
B00004U5VS,5.0,"This game is perfect in every way.  The courses are huge and very pretty. You won't believe what the tracks are! They are awesome! Buy this game now, because it's gonna be hot for the Holidays!",The best game out right now!
B00ZO1SUSE,5.0,"Stella Glow is a strategy RPG, similar to games such as Fire Emblem Awakening or Final Fantasy Tactics. If you're into grid based strategy RPGs then Stella Glow is a great one to try out. The games plot starts off with a boy named Alto and a girl named Lisette watching their town and the people get turned to stone by Hilda, the witch of destruction, singing her song of ruin. With Lisette becoming a witch herself during this encounter and both of them now without a home, they go with the commander of the royal knights, to the capital, Lambert. At the capital, they find out there are more witches and they need four total to sing an ensemble piece. The ensemble piece is rumored to reverse what Hilda has done and save their townspeople, as well as many others throughout the kingdom who were turned to stone as well. They need witches for this musical piece because apparently only witches have the power to sing. Centuries beforehand, their god took away the power of singing for all but a few chosen witches. And thus, Alto ends up taking the exam to be a knight and Lisette, who has now become a witch, will also help out the knights.

Gameplay wise the game is very similar to other strategy RPGs. Your characters move across a grid based battle system, and when you go to attack you can see how much damage your attack will likely do, plus whether the enemy will counter you with an attack of their own. Every character has their own various skills and talents. Its definitely very similar to the Fire Emblem games. What makes it different though, is your characters never get to change to another class type. Instead, whenever you bond with them during affinity events in town, they gain new skills and abilities for battle. Speaking of affinity events, Stella Glow has somewhat of a clock like time system. Every chapter youll have this circle with dedicated mission and free time slots. During missions you continue the story. You also have the option during most dedicated mission times, to battle in extra non story related stages for some much needed experience points. Both of these stages, story and extra leveling, are your standard strategy RPG battles. When you're in a free time slot though, you can do 3 separate things, each thing you spend time doing takes away one of your three, free time actions. You can choose to hangout with another character and raise their affinity, you can wander and collect a random item, or you can choose to do odd  jobs and make some money helping out the owners of various shops. Raising a characters affinity iis pretty much similar to the many story scenes. The other two options are just quick little actions/scenes where you go find an item or help a shop and then get your reward. You don't actually have to do anything, there isn't any sort of mini game to do those.

Atmosphere wise, Stella Glow is amazing. The music is enjoyable and every song seems to suit the stage or story scene perfectly. Even the witches songs you use in battle are good. The characters are very enjoyable too. Theres a whole load of characters both good and evil, who have plenty of personality to them. Theyre voiced well and through affinity missions and the story, you get to learn more about the characters and find out more about their own personal stories. Although, you can only do affinity missions with your party members of course and with limited free time, you can only raise a handful of characters affinity. Youll end up with a pretty big party of people, so it will take multiple plays through to find out all you can about everyone. On the bright side, depending on whose affinity you raise and how far you get it, you will earn one of 12 varying endings. I have yet to fully beat the game, Im almost there, but from what Ive read, if you fully raise different characters affinity, then youll end up with differing endings. That gives you all the more reason to replay this game and get to know everyone and truly appreciate every single character.

Having played Stella Glow for near a week now, and completing all but the final two chapters thus far, I can say that its an amazing SRPG for the 3DS and one you definitely don't want to miss. This game released back in November 2015, I myself didn't buy a copy until almost a year late now. I was definitely missing out this past year. There are a few other 3DS games which weren't as awesome, that I probably shouldve skipped over in favor of buying Stella Glow sooner. Im just glad I finally picked it up, it was well worth buying and I have very much enjoyed this game. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves RPGs in general or even just SRPGs specifically. If the western release of Fire Emblem Fates disappointed you, Stella Glow most certainly won't and is an extremely worthy purchase worth every penny. Its even better if you can find it on sale or get your hands on a launch edition. Im not sure whats going on in your head if you love strategy RPG games but still haven't picked up Stella Glow. I suggest you go pick it up right now and have fun. As an SRPG, I have yet to  find anything wrong with this game, but nothing is perfect. On Amazon I'm giving this review 5 stars. Out of 10 though, I would rate Stella Glow at a 9.

Pros:
- Great story
- Awesome music
- Enjoyable characters
- Extra side stages for leveling up

Cons:
- Too many awesome characters to pick just the 5 or 6 you're allowed to choose each battle stage XD",A Musical & Magical SRPG
B001RTCOWA,5.0,"First I would like to point out the obvious flaws of this game. The checkpoint system is horrible and every time there is a checkpoint it will freeze for around a second no gamebreaker but kinda of annoying. Also at times your guns will go through objects and the game is repetitive but finds  interesting ways to keep it fresh. The reason I gave the game 5 stars is because of how much fun I had with it and how underrated it is. The story of this one is great and voicework for the characters is pretty good they will sound westerny all the way, the characters are also pretty intriguing but its possible to get annoyed by William at times because he comes off with a sort of whinny attitude(Kinda weird how I gained respect for him through the course of the story). The story mode is pretty long for a fps and there are various settings and some free roam sections, you can also upgrade your weapons to get that ugly rusty look out of them. The story is slow at first but picks off in later chapters and the ending is epic, this game is a prequel but it can stand alone as its own beast. You can play as either Ray or Thomas each with his different pros and cons, Ray being mostly the strong one and Thomas the more agile one. The multiplayer is actually great and will keep you hooked for a while and the community is decent. You unlock classes as you earn money from matches and gradually the more money you have the better your weapons will look I have gotten to the ""prime"" state so far. To be honest I enjoyed this game more than killzone 2 and for the price I found it at it was a steal. I highly recommend this game and you can find it very cheap these days so its definitely worth. If you love westerns you can't go wrong with this one.

Ps. A minor complaint is that it has no coop of any sort.",An unexpected surprise.
B0009WPZPE,5.0,"Dead or Alive is one of my favorite series, and I was waiting eagerly for DOA4 to come out for the XBox 360. The graphics were great! Gameplay, though, was not well ramped.

Let's start with the graphics. I've loved each new version of DOA with how it has pushed the envelope. This release was no exception. On our HD TV, the lushness of some scenes was just mind boggling. There were active characters in the background. There were tiny details in every scene. Foot movements would stir up the water or snow.

The audio was reasonably good - not nearly as awesome as the graphics, but certainly good enough that I didn't mind playing with it in the background, as well as it was turned down a bit.

The gameplay in this series is NOT a button masher. You might get lucky occasionally with button mashing, but it really works best if you learn the specific combos that match up to your character's style and for use in certain conditions. Having a near opponent vs a far-away opponent, having an opponent that stays low vs one that launches high attacks, all of them need the proper response.

I don't mind that at all. I respect the game a lot for that reason. On the other hand though, the game is KILLER tough without memorizing those combinations. I had several players in my home who were very, very good on the previous DOAs and they were slaughtered in the new game until they sat down and re-practiced the combos in sparring mode. Yes, sparring mode is there and a good training tool. But it is INCREDIBLY BORING. I would really rather ""learn"" in some sort of actual gameplay setting. Maybe they could have a ""beginning set of rounds"" that was easy, that advanced players could skip over.

Instead, the way the game is set up, there is no difficulty options at all. There is only one ""main game"" that you take each character through, to unlock his or her outfits and endings. That one path is rather hard. So either you sit there in boring sparring mode for a while to prepare - or you just dive into it and get smashed around a lot.

There are other issues. One of our household members went fully through 3 characters. I then took over and went fully through 3 more characters. When he woke up in the morning, the save games were all completely gone. He went through and re-unlocked 3 characters. Everything seemed fine when he was in the game - but come back later, and it had reset. There's just something very wrong with the save situation here.

On one hand I really appreciate that there are female characters in here, and that men as well as women enjoy playing them. It wasn't that long ago that all fighting games were all fighting characters, and that male players would refuse to play as ""just a girl"". In modern times we realize that girls can be just as good at karate as guys are. That being said, some of these outfits are crossing the line into sleaziness. It denigrates a highly trained female martial artist to say she's got to have a big chest that is almost naked.

If you're a fan of fighting games, definitely get this one. Just be sure to prepare for a serious round of training before you start taking on the actual combat.",Great Graphics with Not-Great Rampup

B0081716P2,5.0,"Never played any game in the series, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But after playing the game for about an hour, I was hooked.

The story:
You are an alien working for a company that is in financial trouble. Your boss sends you out after fiding out that a small item you brought back to your home planet, is worth a lot of money. So off you go to look for more treasure.
You land and meet these interesting creatures called ""Pikmin"" whom will follow you and do whatever you ask them to do, from attacks, to gathering valuable objects. Your ship is equiped with an AI unit that helps you keep track of what you collect each day and aslo helps you navigate the terrain. Each night, you and your pikmin must return to your base, because night time means danger, and so you must act quickly or face the consequences. The story kept me playing without stopping, I was hooked. The story is unique and interesting in every aspect and it's fun to see things from the Pikmin's perspective.

The graphics:
Honestly speaking, not so good, but depends greatly on the type of display/TV you are playing on. On a full 1080 HD display, the game looks dated and pixelated. But on a standard TV with a 480 resolution, the game looks great, or at least better than the full HD. I didn't really mind, but it is something you should know, in case you are looking for ""eye candy"". The maps, atmosphere, creatures, etc. are all well done and full of colours, making the game charming and apealing to all audiences.

The Controls:
Easy to use. You need the Wiimote and the nunchuck. The nunchuck is used to move your character and the wiimote is used to point and throw your Pikmin when attacking or gathering objects. Even with 50+ Pikmin following you, controlling them is easy. You press B while moving the wiimote and all the Pikmin will gather around you. You can zoom in with the D-pad. Each time Pikmin attack a creature or when they collect an item for you, they will take the dead creature and/or object back to your ship, so it can be translated into currency; during this sequence is where I found the only problem I had with the game, getting the Pikmin to come back to you, which they don't on their own.
Aside from that, the rest of the game is controlled without a problem.

Sound:
There's background music playing through out, but it is played at a very low level, so it doesn't annoy me. The sound effects are good, but can't really be compared to anything out there, due to the game's unique style, story, etc.

In conclusion:
As I said before, I didn't know what to expect, but as a ""new comer"" to the series, I can say this, the game is great. Full of charm, colourfull characters, some ""tasteful"" animated violence and an overall good time. New comers as myself will be hooked almost inmediately. The graphics may not be top notch, but everything else about the game is great and soon enough graphics don't really matter, because this is a highly addictive and interesting game.",Highly Addictive.

B001383L36,5.0,"I got this collection because I had no idea what was going on in the fourth game. I am extremely happy with this purchase. I consider this a bargain because it's three games for 30 bucks. The only thing I think is horrible is that MGS3's second disk is missing.

MGS1- One word somes up this game. Epic. The story, characters, gameplay, bosses, everything is epic. This game deserves every bit of praise it's received. A solid 5/5.

MGS2- A weak sequal, but by no means a bad game. It's fun and chalanging, but some parts are too easy followed by extremley hard parts. Also, the new player charcter, Raiden, is dissapointing considering I had loved playing as Snake for the fourth and first game. A 4/5.

MGS3- I love this game. You play as Big Boss during the Cold War in Russia fighting your own mentor, her Cobra Unit, a primitive Metal Gear, and last but not least, Volgin. Pretty epic if you ask me. And one thing I truly love about this game is that it is really emotional. The most emotional game I've played. The last boss fight and that last, ringing gun shot is amazing. And the bosses are great, with The End being one of my favorite bosses of all time, right up there with Psycho Mantis. I'd like to give this game a 10/5, but I can't, so I'll have to stick with 5/5.

B00005ML10,5.0,"WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! READ WITH CAUTION! I am a huge Metal Gear fan and a fan of stealth games in particular. MGS2:SOL has been anticipated by gamers and fans alike as the first MGS was one of the best action/stealth/adventure games on the original PlayStation. First off, the graphics and environments are absolutley astonishing. You'd have to awfully hard-pressed not to be in awe with how beautiful this game looks. Character models are highly detailed, right down to the emotion of their faces and how they react to different situations. Weapons are also very detailed and are very accurate to their real-life counterparts. Explosions, rain effects, water effects, anything we take for granted in real life looks amazing on here. Voice acting is superb as David Hayter once again returns as the voice of Solid Snake. The other voice actors are also very good. Music is easily the best the series or any game could possibly have. Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams of The Rock and Armageddon fame, is a treat for the ears. Especially the title sequence and opening movie, the music shines. End credits also feature a pretty good song, althought to me, it sounds a little like a Bond song in a way. Controls are simple yet complex. Most of the controls consist of pressure sensitive. For example, while aiming your pistol, pressing Square fires, but let go of Square lightly, you'll holster your gun. Also when you aquire a machine gun, pushing Square in fires, but hold it lightly and you'll be able to aim. The list goes on and on. The level of level interaction is also incredible. Shoot out a light, and the pieces of the bulb fall to the ground. Shoot a pipe and steam comes out. Also, depending on where you shoot a guard, he also reacts realistically. The story, while confusing and will require you to take a course in politics and the like, is great as always. Now, with all the praise I'm lavishing on this, I did have a few minor but one major complaint. One is the confusing part of the story, Codec transmissions cut in every time and could have been done in real time instead of talking heads, and Raiden. While I didn't really care if he was in the game, what annoyed me is that he took over a good portion of the game and that you practically have to hold his hand to do anything. The idea that Hideo Kojima had for Raiden sounded good on paper, but he's just a pretty boy and nothing else. Thankfully, on MSG3:Snake Eater( which i plan to get), you get to play as Snake(albeit Big Boss with a Snake codename). Also, the bosses weren't quite as good as the ones on the first Metal Gear Solid. Solidus Snake is cool, but I really didn't care much for Vamp, Fatman, or Fortune(although Fatman's pretty funny) and the thing involving Liquid Snake in Revolver Ocelot's arm is pretty ludicrous. But overall, its still a awesome game and once you get over having to play as Raiden, it's still offers great stealth action and loads of interacting with the backgrounds. I give it my highest recommendation. A 5 out of 5.

P.S.

For those of you that do like my reviews, I plan to get Snake Eater in the coming month, so watch for it then. In the meanwhile, check out my other reviews.

B007PX6M9S,5.0,This is amazing and I'm glad I buy these cases.,Wonderful for games
B000FBMITA,5.0,"This is my first venture into a 'Hitman' game having just bought an Xbox 360 and I must say it's worth every penny. All the positive notes you've read before about the graphics, storyline, playability, etc are all true. However, there are other games with similar specs - Ghost Recon on the X360 immediately springs to mind which is also a fine game.

But what makes 'Hitman' my game of the year so far is it's flexibility, i.e. finishing a level off one way then going back and trying a totally different way of killing off the same bad guy. There are so many ways of doing the levels and all can acheive the same objective but with very different challenges.

Example? Well, without giving the game away, I had to kill a crook who was also a wine expert at his own ranch, teeming with guards. So I bumped off one of his guards, took his clothes then made my way through the house without being detected before bumping the old boy off. Great...but, there's also a wall round the back which I can also use to get in the house through the back way, or there's a side door with a fusebox to kill the lights then hide in a cupboard, or....etc,etc, get the drift?

There's so many ways to try the same assignment, some easy, some not so....it's up to you to work out the best way that suits you.

Add to that the difficulty levels that make the game as hard as you like and there's many visits back to the same assignment which increases the longevity of the game.

So buy this game....you won't be disappointed!",Utterly Brilliant
B00005AKUQ,5.0,Who doesn't love the Duke!? The original alien killer. The point of this game is you play as Duke (obviously) and you travel through time collecting crystals trying to stop the aliens from destroying humanity. Basic Duke Nukem stuff. But....those of you who have played Duke Nukem before should know he's still the same wise-cracking badass as we we've all come to know and love. Five stars and two thumbs WAY up!,Duke Nukem: Time To Kill
B00EV4O86I,5.0,"If you are going to get a 3ds i would urge you to get the XL. The screen on the regular 3ds is too small and can be very hard on the eyes. we all know how kids are and they will spend hours playing. Its better for them to have a larger screen rather the a smaller one relieving the stress on the eyes. Especially since you can also watch netflix and hulu on it, as well as surfing the web.",way better then reg 3ds
B00004SVP8,5.0,"I remember as a kid thinking ""Whoa, the Dragon Warrior series has to be pretty darn good to have a fourth one!"" while reading through Nintendo Power magazines in the early 90's.  Let's see if it's as good as DWIII which is WAY better than the first two Dragon Warrior's.

It starts off about a soldier named Ragnar who is summoned by the king to find several missing children.  After this you leave the castle, notice how the world and sprites are slightly bigger than in DWIII and take hold of the gigantic land around you.  When you enter a nearby cave you'll fight stag beetles, slime, giant worms and diverats.  Head into Izmit village and buy some stuff at the armor and item shops.  I like how there's a children's school here- this game is already showing some cool variety.  Head outside into the woods to face demon stump, diverats and slimes.

Fight the same bad guys at night.  When you enter another village take the woman to her husband who's in jail (in Izmit village).  You also hear advice about a secrete playground, and instructions on how to get there.  Follow instructions, fall down a well and enter a mysterious cave maze.  Face off against sizarmages.  They look like jolly wizards but they're not!  Healers are here.  Lethal gopher holds a shovel and looks like a troll.  He's actually really creepy looking!  Someone named Healie joins your party.  His or her name should be a clue- she or he can heal you!  I guess that was the whole reason going through this long cave.

Healie can also attack.  Leave this area by falling through the ground.  Back in Izmit village you go to buy or sell armor and items.  Step outside with your flying shoes on and away we go!  Wow what a psychedelic moment that is!  You see someone dragging a ""brat"" by the hand in the tower you're about to go in.  Fight ozwargs and lilypas (the latter with a bow and arrow).  Ducksbill is oversized and goofy looking.  A new enemy finally (called Pixie) which looks like some kind of demonic soldier.  Giant bantam is a big ol' chicken... literally!  You finally arrive to a room where... you step on a switch so it glows white.

You meet someone who informs you that an evil entity (ruler of evil) is waking up.  You then see a child screaming for help before fighting a king called Saro's Shadow and a giant eyeball enemy (attached to an alien body, heh).  Leave the tower and return the children to their mother (the same mother who begged you to find her kids at Burland castle).  Now it's Chapter 2 (the game even says so) about a princess named Alena.  Her father doesn't agree with her behavior, but she wants to go out in the monster-populated world and test her strength.  You control Alena.

Alena being a tomboy and rebellious girl kicks a wall down, leaves the castle against her fathers orders and when she does Brey and Cristo (two soldiers) join your party.  Enter Surene town and upgrade your equipment.  Outside you fight kaskos hoppers, troglodytes, prank gophers, red slimes, big eared elerats, rabidhounds and oh boy, giant worms return!  Not that they're a threat.  In a nearby town (Tempe) you hear the story of a monster who moved into the woods desiring young girls.  Just like in DWIII!  You find out one of the daughters in the village, Nina, is to be offered.  Ha!  Alena is willing to be an offer!  Of course we know why.  The battle is on against two rabidhounds and a chameleon humanoid.

You're asked to go to a tournament in Ender after the battle.  New enemies when you head north- blazeghosts and brahmird, two VERY scary enemies.  You see a princess being kidnapped in the next town you visit.  Carnivore plants look MEAN!  Demon toadstools return.  You find out in order to get the princess back you need to bring the village treasure (Golden Bracelet) to the graveyard.  Enter a nearby orange cave and face vampire bats (what are they some kind of mummy?), somnabeetles, thevros, brahmird the chicken and the crested viper looks like a chicken-headed green snake!  Oh boy orcs and ozwargs!

When night falls give the monsters the items you acquired, rescue the princess, find out she's not really a princess and is an actress (lol!) and get the thief's key.  Troglodytes go down fast after upgrading so much!  Enter a desert town, and speak with a person who says you must return to the king quickly because he's in trouble.  Use the whirlpool warp to hurl up high and head back to the king's castle.  The king can't speak so you must find a healer (Marone).  You go to the desert to find medicine.  Sand masters!  They're like the other snakes and worms but brown.

Enter the next tower, battle pteranodons, flythrope (some kind of possessed moth!), poison lizards, orcs, grisly sabers (sharp!), spectet (an eyeball alien with legs- so scary!), butterfly dragons, monsters-in-a-tornado foes called razor winds.  Get medicine to help the kings throat!  Use wing of wyvern to get back to the king.  After you give the king the throat-clearing medicine, he believes an evil force was the reason behind his illness based on nightmares he had so... go on princess!  Go on that journey the king originally said you can't go on, haha.

Find an area with whirlpool portal out in the open, and use it to get to new lands to battle skeletons!  Enter town of Ender.  You can bet on monsters at the gambling tournament.  Buy or sell anything necessary.  Talk to the king.  He wants you to win the tournament because he promised the winner would marry his princess daughter, however the princess wants Alena to win so she doesn't have to get married.  Leave through a side door to the left, travel north and enter the tournament.  Defeat hun, roric, vivian, sampson, linguar... and the final competitor doesn't want to come out!  After victory the princess says some *very* interesting lines, haha.  I won't touch on this subject!

Return to a mysteriously quiet Santeen castle.  You'll find out the disappearance of everyone in this castle as well as your final opponent in the tournament (named Necrosaro, the baddest bad guy in the Dragon Warrior series) disappeared for a reason.  Now begins Chapter 3!  A man named Taloon lives in a town called Lakanaba.  He wants to become the worlds greatest merchant someday.  You have to push an old man to the house of healing, lol.  An innkeeper wants you to take over working at his weapons shop!  This is really good storytelling.  You have to deal with customers asking to buy stuff.  Maybe a little long however.

After this head west to new lands and new music, then a cave. Push buttons to drain water, avoid poorly animated slow moving boulder, fall in a hole, talk to man about an iron safe, battle babbles and prank gophers.  Enter nearby town, avoid prison guards, help a thief prisoner escape by giving him what he wants- a wing of wyvern.  Leave, return when it's dark, and talk to Prince Reed.  He wants you to go Ender as soon as the bridge is repaired to return a letter.  Battle demon stumps, healers and giant worms.  Borrow a dog, obtain the Full Plate Armor from the dog, and when you return the dog the owner says ""Go back to your cage"".  Wow, talk about scolding a very good dog!  The music here reminds me of a Christmas song-  ""Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too!"" and specifically the line ""There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray, it'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day"" part from the famous ""Sleigh Ride"" song.  Hey maybe only I hear it!

Go back to the king to find out the bridge is complete, so he can invade Ender.  Wow the storyline is starting to get confusing by this point.  Too many characters moving too fast.  Go back to Ender to discover elements from the previous story with Alena and how she won the tournament.  Nice detail there, but this game specializes in a well-made storyline as you will see the more you play through it.  Deliver the letter to princess Mia.  The letter reads about stopping the invasion of Ender by the king of Bonmalmo.  The king of Ender gives you a scroll to give to the king of Bonmalmo.  Seriously this is a fetch quest.

Battle blazeghosts, demon stumps and lethal gophers.  When you arrive to the king of Bonmalmo, you read the scroll.  The king of Ender's daughter Mia and the king of Bonmalmo's son Reed are in love and want to get married.  This means since Reed will become the king of Ender, the king of Bonmalmo won't have to invade Ender.  Back to visit the king, he grants you permission to own a shop, and a guardsman wants to work for you for 5 days because there's horrible monsters lurking near a cave filled with treasure.  His name's Strom and he joins your party.  Also someone who specializes in spell casting joins your party for 5 days (Laurent).

Enter cave and face off against elefrover (an octopus thing) and vampire bats.  Take boat ride through cave.  No this isn't as epic as the boat rides from Dragon Warrior III, but still somewhat entertaining.  Flythrope the demented moth is back again.  Sand masters and ducksbills appear.  The giant bantam (the giant chicken) and poison lizards are here as well.  Elefrover!  You're here too?  After spending a while to make enough money to buy your own shop, Taloon and his wife Neta agree to make it the best shop they possibly can.  Whoa!  Strom and Laurnet weren't kidding when they said they'd leave after 5 days.  They just up and leave!

A man has a dream to dig caves and collect treasure but he needs some money to start the excavation project.  As soon as Neta gets the message that the cave is finished, go there.  Chapter 4 begins!  This story is about two sisters who seek to avenge their father.  Mara the older sister is a dancer, and Nara the younger one is a fortune teller.  This story begins in the town of Monbaraba.  Mara finishes a singing performance entertaining the people and heads backstage.  The master says it's okay for the two sisters to leave even though he wants them to stay because of Mara's popularity, but morning comes and off the two sisters go!

Outside in the grass they face kaskos hoppers, red slimes, rabidhounds, monjar the bird and troglodytes.  Enter the town of Kieves (the sister's hometown) and learn about Edgar and his pupil Balzack.  Angel head looks like a mean bat, and sizarmage is no magician (and I think I made the same comparison in Dragon Warrior III).  Inside a cave you battle lava dolls (heh, more like female stone doll!), demon toadstool, pitchfork holding xemime squirrels (I hate to say it but they're adorable) and blazeghosts.  Find Lamp of Darkness after exploring through water areas.  You hear a voice from Orin (another pupil) about using the Sphere of Silence to overcome Balzack's magic powers.  He joins your party!

Someone in green tells you to give up looking for the Sphere of Silence.  No!  New enemies outside- liclick's (you can see how they got their name!) are more than just ripoffs of previous enemies, and magemonja is a green bird thing.  Infurnus beetles are small.  You'll find out Orin can break down tough doors when you get in town.  Haville is a ship town.  Visit the armor and weapon shops to buy what you need.  Demon stump has a friend, and his name is dark doriard!  Viceter is a new big eared mouse enemy.  In the house of prophecy you find out your enemy is surrounded by evil but you're surrounded by tiny lights since you're the hero.

You enter a cave town that's VERY depressing since everyone's either dead or knocked out on gas coming from the caves.  Inside the cave (since you probably guessed you're going to be exploring here) rogue wisper enemies resembles sad faced ghosts!  Weretigers are an interesting combination of two animals!  Liclick's lurk here too.  Baby salamand reminds me of a catfish but very red colored.  Garcoil roosters continue the chicken theme.  Mini slimes stacking on top of one another to create a big king slime, haha!

You talk to Balzack after freeing a man and finding a secret button.  He mentions Edgar tried to destroy the Secret of Evolution.  Fight Balzack with his arms trying to grab you.  After defeat you have to fight a new enemy called Keeleon.  After he defeats you, grab the boarding pass and run away from the guards who trap you and threaten to throw you in prison.  Orin soon says he can't accompany you anymore and recommends you leave the country now.  With the boarding pass you can enter the ship.  Talk to the people on board and find out about one characters father, but you get little information about the supposed agony of the situation.  You can't come back according to the captain.  Chapter 4 ends here as Mara and Nara arrive to a new castle after a ship ride.

Chapter 5 begins with a character named Sophia who is supposed to take lunch to her fishing father.  She walks around town learning about poetic strangers entering town and having to be on your guard.  Suddenly Sophia has to hide from monsters approaching town (and before doing so learns her parents aren't her real parents- gee thanks for that bombshell announcement, great timing!)  Turns out Sophia was born with a great power but at this early stage she's too weak to fight.  A girl named Celia enters Sophia's hiding place and wants to protect Sophia by turning into an exact version of her so the monsters think they've killed Sophia.  The monsters also respond to Necrosaro which is a big hint.

It *is* a sad moment when Sophia leaves the cellar and sees the town has been destroyed and everyone disappeared.  We assume the monsters wiped everyone out.  Darn.  The king mentions that you should prevent the resurrection of the evil ruler at any cost necessary, and the queen mentions elements from previous stories involving the Princess of Ender and the Prince of Bonmalmo getting married.  Hmmm, we hear a story about a celestial maiden coming down from the mountains.  I'll say more about this story later.  It's interesting because it implies she gave birth to Sophia.

Walk around battling stag beetles, monjars, diverats, rabidhounds, carnivore plants, ozwarg, pixies, magemonjas, sizarmages, lethal gophers, poison arrops, lilypas, metal slimes and babbles.  Hear a story about a woodsman from an old man who's reflecting by the water.  More elements from previous stories when you enter a familiar cave and hear about Taloon.  Enter town, talk to fortune teller (Nara).  She reads your fortune, mentions lights being around you providing protection and realizes you're the hero.  Nara joins your party.  Go to gambling center and let gambling addict Mara join the party.  Enter cave to battle vampire bats, sand masters, ducksbills and elefrovers.

Travel to a new town and talk to a man who was once an adventurer in search of treasure, but his friend betrayed him. Dang!  This story hits hard for some reason.  Armor scorpions arrive soon, and they look ready to fight!  Mad clowns- funny enemy name.  Enter the cave on far east side and battle liclicks (who pretend to need saving- nice try fellows!)  Fall through the floor and find out you battled the imposters upstairs- now you must fight tricksy urchin and vampire bats.  You encounter Mara and Nara who think you're an imposter and question whether you're the real Sophia.  Who can trust who!

Bash walls, step outside to fight giant eyeballs, thevros and mad clowns.  The man who was betrayed by his friend joins the party (Hector) and you can use his wagon.  Be nice to his horse!  Head through the desert battling arrops, rogue knights, dark doriards, barrenth (a bear enemy) and crested vipers.  Garcoil roosters are on the loose.  I forgot about razor winds!  What are these tornado-shaped enemies doing in such a calm grassy area I wonder?  I can say the same about weretigers!  You find out they're building a new ship in next town.

In the purple lighthouse fight rogue knights, rogue wispers, mad clowns, skeletons, pteranodon birds, vileplants and metal slimes.  Talk to Taloon about extinguishing an evil fire through the lighthouse.  Now that's odd.  You encounter a man who seems possessed to kill Taloon, but he hits his head on the ceiling and knocks himself out.  Fight the bosses responsible for this fire (flamer and lighthouse bengal).  Get Fire of Serenity from chest and throw it on the evil fire.  Visit Taloon in town so he can join the party and mention the ship is complete.  Yay!

Head to town of Mintos down south.  Battle vampire bat-resembling vampdogs and viceters.  In town princess Alena's search for medicine is mentioned.  This person named Brey joins your party in search of Alena.  An adventurous merchant named Howden is *very* arrogant about his treasure searching abilities while exploring the sea.  He gives you a treasure map.  Encounter plesiosaur enemies while sailing.  I think they're octopus.  Also blowfish-looking banglers.  A beautiful place you visit on your boat is called Riverton.  I'd love to live there!  Metal scorpions on land aren't much fun.  Skeletons, viceters, mage toadstools, demonites and garcoil roosters too.

Visit town of Soretta which contains the cure-all Padequia seed.  Talking to the farmers and field kings, it turns out the padequia plant is extinct due to a drought that occurred 5 years ago, but the previous king left padequia seeds in a cave in case something were to happen to them... and now the cave is filled with monsters!  Yup, even the king is working the fields based on how poor this country has become.  Bisonhawks are scary oversized chickens.  Battle iceloth (giant bear with its tongue sticking out) and infurnus knights on land.  Inside the ice cave battle vampdogs, baby salamands (not exactly babies!) and bisonhawks.  Conjurer is an interesting enemy.

You encounter princess Alena and she believes she'll find the padequia seeds before you do.  Slide forward on the ice boosters.  Grab padequia seeds after ice boost puzzle and head back to Soretta.  Watch it grow and get a root for your reward.  Give padequia root to ill Cristo so he and Alena can find Necrosaro.  After realizing Sophia has beef with Necrosaro as well, everyone joins together!  Storyline continuity!  A man listening in on this conversation mentions a man named Ragnar who was going to the country of Keeleon.  And... that's all he says!  A nice way to tease you huh?  Suddenly Hector decides to leave the party so he can study management under old Howden.  Well that's a little bit of a surprise!

While on the ship you encounter runamok albacores.  In a southern town you meet Healie and you need to rescue Ragnar but... you need a magic key!  Battle bisonbears and phantom skeletal knights outside.  Whoa now!  Phantom messengers look royally scary.  Dragonpup vampires are eerie red.  Butterfly dragons need to go away.  Banglers, guzzle rays, man o' wars and plesiosaurs in the ocean.  Besides the man o' wars, these water creatures are different from the ones in Dragon Warrior III.  Not sure if they're better or worse though.

Bright red lethal armors on land.  Stancia town is covered in water and you need the boat to get around.  I like this town a lot!  The king here wants someone to make him laugh but... Sophia's jokes fall flat.  Oh well.  See Panon so he can join the party.  Go back to the laughless king.  Huh, so instead of Panon making the king laugh he encourages the king to give his party the zenithian helm!  I love what the king says- he initially issued a proclamation to try and encourage people to get the king to laugh but he now realizes this was a failure since the people of this town feel hopeless over monster concerns.  If the people can't make themselves laugh, they can't make the king laugh either.  It's clever really.  Panon leaves the party soon after.

Bisonbears all over the forest.  Dragonpups, demonites, glowing mystic dolls and flamers in the cave.  You finally encounter Ragnar.  He says he's finally found the hero he's been searching for and we fit the description!  Ragnar joins your party, enters the hidden room nearby, and you approach the ruler of this land (Keeleon).  He was seeking revenge against Balzack!  Time to fight Keeleon.  He looks like a multi-legged lion!  Easy fight.  Keeleon wonders if Sophia and the party are here to destroy the ruler of evil.  Necrosaro was supposed to destroy the hero but nope!  We're still here!  Ragnar officially joins the party.

Time to explore the lands.  Ew, ouphnest beards!  Curers, flamers, mystic dolls, runamok albacores, phantom messengers and pink savnuck lions all hanging around these lands.  Time to encounter Balzack.  Even Necrosaro is no match for Balzack according to Balzack.  He's certainly changed... into a big fat dragon holding a wooden club!  Balzack believes he should have been invincible.  Nope!  He's holding onto the Secret of Evolution, but the Golden Bracelet is necessary to perfect it because the Golden Bracelet amplifies the evil force.  Rhinothrope appears!  You can tell he wants to slice you up.

While visiting Izmit village, everyone's having strange dreams.  Sophia has a strange dream herself about two characters named Saro and Rosa having a conversation on top of a tower.  Saro says he's decided to exterminate mankind and that Rosa should stay here until it's done.  Huh, not much different from the way I dream as far as the eerie tone and the uncharacteristic things people say.  Not that I dream about destroying the world, but things on a smaller scale.  Real people I know saying off the wall crazy things in dream world!

Visit a king so he can explain the Zenithian shield and how it was once in the castle you're standing in, and how in his grandfather's time it was given to the Queen of Gardenbur. This castle is blocked by lava currently.  Archbison!  They're basically the same as the other chicken varieties.  Oh boy, bigger enemies!  Chillanodons (which are basically the same as pteranodons) and deceivingly adorable tyranosaurs.

LOL!  In a nearby town you enter a room and you're encouraged to open a drawer to find something, but after you do the same person who encouraged you to open it calls you a thief and you're under arrest!  Reminds me of that story my dad shared- when he was a kid an older girl gave him a nickel... then she runs to the teacher and says my dad stole her nickel, LOL!

Anyway the prison is too small for the whole party!  Just look at that tiny room.  You're asked to plead your innocence to the queen, and the whole conversation is hilarious considering you're perfectly innocent... well then again you HAVE been going around opening drawers the whole game so you're actually guiltier than the queen realizes!  You're given a chance to find the thief but one person has to stay behind and remain in jail.  You can choose which party member stays in jail.

Fight more chillanodons and tyranosaurs in the woods, then enter a water cave to fight great ohruses (basically walruses), skull knights, blue-winged dragonits, blue mantam chickens, hambalba (who desires to grab you much like his ancestors!) and evil beleth with his giant sythe.  This cave is pretty elaborate with lots of climbing to higher mountain areas.  You fight bakor the thief.  After the fight a girl shows up saying the queen sent her out to provide assistance for the party.  Haha, the way she drags the thief out of the room is hilariously exaggerated.  Archbison chickens and chillanodons are hogging up the forest.

When you return to the castle you get the final key as your reward for capturing the thief, and the zenithian shield.  Check out Rosaville which is south.  Before that, give all your medals to the king and in return you can have the hat of happiness and other items.  Head out to the sea, face sealthrope and other enemies and arrive to a cave with a stream running through it.  An enemy by the name of Karon is here.  No not Karen Carpenter!  This Karon's a magician.  Necrodain is some kind of skeleton enemy.  Fury face!  He's multi-headed and really frightening.  Dragon Rider is impressive in appearance.  Just when you thought you had enough of multi-headed things, Maskan has two sets of eyes!  The eyes on top are scary wide.  Plesiodon is a shiny octopus creature.

Oh this place is starting to fill up with boulders.  Awesome imagery for an NES game.  Find the zenithian armor in chest.  Podokesaur!  He's probably related to tyranosaurs.  Sail on until you stumble upon a water cave.  Balakooda lurks here (clever choice of letters huh!), minidemons are here as well.  Maelstroms!  These are basically more tornado enemies.  Use Stone of Drought on water.  You get the Sandglass of Regression.  Doolsnake looks like a previous snake enemy... and I think that's the point- the game likes to recycles the same enemies but make them tougher incarnations.

Leave if you want, but beleths, skull knights, dragonits and chillanodons are waiting outside.  In the water cave hemaswords are flashing red, raygarth is some kind of stingray and tentagor is a green octopus.  In Rosaville we find out the dream Sophia had about Sora... Sora's a real person and he built the tower Sophia dreamed about.  He even built a secret chamber and hid something precious in it.  We find out an elf named Rosa used to live in this village, and her teardrops turned into rubies.  Rather cruel, humans MADE her cry so she'd create ruby teardrops for them.  That's just... genius.  I mean awful!

Play the flute to uncover the same stairway Sophia dreamed about.  Saroknight is a minor threat... until chillanodon comes along.  Upon finding out you're not here to humiliate Rosa, you're given knowledge on the location of the Staff of Transform which is used to protect yourself from monsters.  What the!  Saro renamed himself Necrosaro!  I never even noticed the final four letters in his name until just now, haha.  Now it makes sense!  He even used the Secret of Evolution to make himself stronger.

Face off against tyranobat, dragonit, metal babbles (that prove to be a little harder than they look), hambalba and hemaswords in golden castle (with more speed boosters to boot).  Oh wow, bebanbars!  Check out how scary they are... or looking at the way they're dressed, are they ready for a stage show?  In the next tower you face HUGE jumbats.  I guess the ""jum"" stands for jumbo!  Also you face axe-holding rhinobands, bebanbars, multi-legged leaonars, blizag, karon the rat-faced magician, necrodain skeletons and snowjive the mouse (what, where's the snow?).  Fall from the tower statue and... oh!  The tower is shaped like a person!  You land in their hand and explore their brain I guess.  You can even move the tower statue across water!  That's interesting.

On land face mighty healers and chaos hoppers.  Alena uses the Staff of Transform to get by the monster filled areas of next castle.  Awesome!  You're now in the same room as Saro in disguise.  Saro insists on going to the town of Aktemto and bringing Esturk the Great (the lord of darkness) to his castle.  A guard on the rooftop says it best- ""If Necrosaro perfects the secret of Evolution even the celestial master won't meddle with us"".

Enter Aktemto by heading north- it's a mining town.  Looks like monsters got to this town too since it's deserted and depressing.  Enter cave.  Rogue wispers, viceters, metal scorpions, mad clowns, weretigers, garcoil roosters, chaos hoppers, maskans, necrodains, wyverns, dragon riders and a battle with eigerhorn!  He reminds me of Man Clown from Super Punch Out.  King healer's a big ball of gross.  Rhino king and Bengal are mini boss fights.  Whoa!!  Time to battle Esturk!  He stands there so intimidating with his swords sticking out.  He reminds me of the devil.  The music even changes into something cool and reminds me of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

In comes Necrosaro who believes in the prophecy that a descendant of Zenithians is capable of defeating the ruler.  Also Necrosaro gets news that Rosa has been kidnapped by humans.  One person in town says something interesting.  He mentions Santeen's dream coming true pertaining to men aiding Esturk's resurrection, and that he tried to stop the excavation at Aktemto, which is why he was crushed by the evil force.  Sophia has another dream, this one about Rosa being forced to shed ruby teardrops and Necrosaro saving her from human bullies.

Float in an orange hot air balloon south across the lands and water, then east and south to the desert tree town.  Enter tree to battle metal scorpions, viceters, mage toadstools, eigerhorns, snowjive moths, green dragons, red cyclones, chaos hoppers and spike ball-smacking ogres.  A person named Lucia appears.  She wants you to take her back to Zenithian castle after a monster broke her wings.  She also reveals the Zenithian sword is hidden somewhere in this tree.  She says ""Shall we leave?""  I get it. :)  Lucia joins your party.  Haha, the Zenithian sword is just a few steps to the right!

Take the hot air balloon south and east to a new land with wilymages, sythe-holding infurnus sentinel demons, fat king metal blobs and red-haired ferocial lions.  In a small town we find out another Esturk is about to be born and that it's urgent to see someone named Master Dragon.  People are afraid since Necromaro has the Golden Bracelet and began using the Secret of Evolution underground.

While in the forest fighting monsters, enter a nearby rundown tower.  Take the stairs until you find treasure with the Dress of Radiance and Baron's Horn.  Enter tower with long stairway. Wow this place has tons of rooms to explore.  Noctabats are bright purple!  Beastans are well... the same ol' arm-reaching monsters we've seen in other varieties throughout the game.  Pit viper snakes are here.  Bharack the colorful elf.  The music changes into something soft as a cloud floats down, and you're taken to a castle far away in the clouds.  By being here you've taken Lucia back to her (Master Dragon's) Zenithian castle.",wow!!

B00170823O,5.0,"Okay, so this isn't an extensive review.  The person who wrote the longer one detailing just what's great about this game and just what the critics got wrong was spot on.  And I've even read the reviews not rating this game so high.  Nitpicky.  All the things they find faulty or challenging about this game, I just thought it was all great.  And the guy that talks about the licensing?, really, you'd rather have a game called The Rocketeer?  No, you wouldn't; it came out for the 8 bit Nintendo and was terrible and I will never or extremely rarely buy a licensed game because they're just making it as part of the synergy to promote the current largest media outlet of that product: movie games especially.  I only make an exception for Spider-Man; I have broken down and bought two of those, but only when they were not tied to a movie of any kind, because then they were independent creations and Web of Shadows really let me down.

But back to this game.  Dark Void is a blast.  I love it how when you're close enough to enemies and shoot them, you hear the 'tink,' 'clink,' 'skarmp' of your laser blast pelting their metal.  I like it when from wherever you start your jet blast, your characters legs flail all out like he's really blasting off--nice animation.  I like the variety of attacks you can use and the different visual environments.  I'm only a few hours into it and from peaking at some of the levels on youtube, I have quite a ways left to go.

This game is unbeatable for the price.  I hope enough people buy this game on whichever platform so that there can be a part II.  If you add this game to your library you will not be disappointed.  If I had to say it was a mix of games, I'd say it was a cross somewhere between Dead Space and Uncharted.  It feels a lot like Drake's brother playing the protagonist.  And the neatest thing about this game, is yes, the fully 3-D environment. You can move the camera and see all angles of every piece of the level.  You can attack up and right in front of you.  I like how one of the in-game hints says ""If you can't find where to go, look up!""

I also liked the Bionic Commando game, except for the voicing, and in a way this feels a little similar to me, but if I had to pick one to play, I'd go with this one, you can fly!  Okay, I think that wraps it up.  Let me get back to playing.",THIS is a fun game

B000FQ2D5E,5.0,"Without blowing any story details, I'm just going to get this out of the way: Metal Gear Solid 4 - Guns of the Patriots is the conclusion to the Solid Snake era of the series and it has been done right, and better than what I had in mind. Simply, there's no way I could have asked for a better ending than this. I've always been a fan of the MGS story lines, and this is my favorite part of the story. I understand Hideo Kojima has talked about the series continuing but without him being directly involved anymore as well as the absence of the long-time protagonist Solid Snake, but after this game fans would be left to question where would the series go when MGS5 comes out? Well, we won't know until then so let's enjoy MGS4.

MGS4's gameplay shouldn't be a stranger to fans of the older titles, however there are some noticeable differences. The CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system button is now ""R1"" instead of the ""O"" from MGS3, you fire weapons with (at least) two buttons (one to aim then another to fire), scope and camera zoom-ins are use the D-pad to magnify, the D-pad during the control of Snake does not move him, and the system of acquiring weapons is a bit different and the process is rather unusual for MGS games (you do more than just picking up guns off the floor). There are additions to holding-up such as patting enemies down to steal items, there are TONS of weapons in this game, a great variety but you'll never need some of them, and there is a ""psyche meter"" (similar to the Stamina from MGS3) and a stress meter which all take effect in Snake's performance. Aside from that the game is still no stranger to MGS fans as it still has the same feel after you get used to the new control system (I do have to say firing the gun easily took some practice and patience because it was so frustrating at times, but auto-aim eases it up). If you were disappointed in the lack of radar in MGS3, then the ""Solid-Eye"" is a nice welcome similar to a radar. Camera angles are totally free and can be controlled with the R-analog stick. After you get used to the controls, like I said, it's a breeze playing through like the old titles in the series.

Metal Gear Solid 4's playthrough is similar to the old MGS games - self-explanatory. Cut-scenes are one of the beauties of this game along with it's graphics despite the lengths of them. Be prepared for long cut-scenes and if you plan to watch them all, get ready for many (and I mean MANY) hours of gameplay. But in my opinion the scenes move the story along, and it's very engaging. I hardly noticed the lengths of them until I got my total play time at the end of the game, I was very engaged in everything going on in the game to every action and emotion, and I love the addition of flash-back images in the game that give me memories of playing the older titles and seeing how the story of MGS4 came about because of the previous events. So MGS4, like the other titles, is very cinematic and the most cinematic taking advantage of the PS3 technology, but fans of the series shouldn't be burdened by this if they are intrigued by the storyline and the continuity.

In a way I would consider this game mostly for people who are already fans of the series. The storyline wouldn't make as much sense if you hadn't played the previous titles and understand what happened and all. If you just played through without getting the stories on the older titles you'd enjoy the gameplay here as well.

In conclusion, MGS4 is an amazing game taking advantage of being on the PS3, the gameplay and gripping storyline should appeal to the fans of the series, and it's worth it to check out the conclusion of Snake's era in the series. 5 Stars, highly recommended!",End of an Era

B0000AHOOG,5.0,"The game hasn't arrived yet so this shouldn't be considered a review. But more a cheer actually. To those of you who don't know what Gradius is, here it is:
Gradius is a side scrolling shooter, just like the shooters in the arcades 10 years ago. The main thing with Gradius is that you buy your weapons instead of picking them up. The more power ups you collect (without buying) the better the weapon.
Gradius first appeared in the Arcades, and became a HUGE hit.
It has appeared on NES, SNES, Playstaion (but Japan only, which is a real shame), and Playstation 2.) The best thing about Gradius is probably this though: It has ALWAYS stayed the same, with some exceptions:
Gradius: LifeForce (NES) added 2 players on screen.
Gradius III (SNES) added tactical weapons placement.
I remember the first time I played this series on Nintendo, and it ruled! Then came LifeForce, also for Nintendo, and it actually had 2 player mode (like both players on the screen at the same time! Yes!!) So LifeForce is actually the best game in the series in my opinion.
The second best version is Gradius III for the Super Nintendo. It didn't have 2 player, but hey: It had something cool instead: Tactical weapons placement, i.e you could choose where your weapons would be placed on your ship. You could choose an offencive or defence stance! Gradius III was thrown along with IV in the first Playstation 2 release, but was much harder, and without the original SNES music. (I can't say if this is the original music that came in the arcade version or not, because I haven't played the arcade version. But I at least like the SNES version a lot better.)
Next came a sad story: A great game, that recieved excellent ratings, didn't come to Europe or USA. Too bad about Gradius Gaiden, which only came out in Japan, a game which also had two players at the same time on screen.
The version on the Playstation 2 was a tadd more difficult, and the music was not the music I was used to on the SNES (which is far better.) On the cover it said ""2 player."" But that wasn't 2 player, it was only 2 players taking turns in playing. Boooh!
Gradius III & IV on the Playstation 2 was a HUGE let down.
The music was not so cute and catchy as before, far more difficult (as in impossible), and IV had actually become worse than III (III was much more durable in weapon selection.)
But, despite the let down on Playstation 2, Konami decides to give it another go, and release ""V""! Yes!! I hope they pay attention to what fans have been saying. Keep the gameplay intact, try not to get ultra sorround sound crystal music (because that just isn't the good old game man), and please, if at all possible, let's see 2 players on screen (this is asking a lot, but please???!) What the news so far says though, is that the game will now have the same weapon system as on Gradius III, but with even more weapons. Yes! :)
So, ok, I gave you my rant now, hope it adds to the page, and your excitement about this new release.
And let's all hope that this new game embraces nostalgia freaks, as well as high tech new comers to shooters, and the Gradius phenomenon.",This is it

B008GFZV6Y,5.0,"Kirby's Dream collection, published in 2012 in celebration of 20 years for the pink-puff. It was the last title Nintendo published for the Wii console. You get a big colorful cover box which is mostly pink because of all the Kirby(s) that populate it. Inside you will find another box, the game case with a cover art that looks like someone took a plank of wood and seared the titles right on.. with what looks like two (psudo-)foil stickers highlighting ""New challenge stages"" and ""Kirby's History"". I also found inside a nice color 45 page art-book. Inside the game case you will find the game on a disc, a color manual, and a soundtrack CD featuring 45 tracks from various Kirby games.

The Kirby's History section of the disc allows you to control Kirby frantically running up and down a long hallway at a speed which rivals even Sonic the Hedgehog with no care of running into others. You get to see exhibits highlighting major events in Kirby and Nintendo history, including various trailers, gameplay videos, and 3 episodes from the TV show ""Kirby: Right back at ya"".

The six Kirby games featured are:
Kirby's Dreamland (1,2, & 3), Kirby's Adventure, Kirby Superstar (sadly the non-Ultra edition which was made for the DS), Kirby 64: The crystal shards. The Gameboy games are in B&W the rest are in color. They are all pretty much ports of the original games playing on your Wii/WiiU console. The early games feature the ""Nintendo Hard"" feel. The games I find myself returning to most are the last 3 games. Playing with a friend in co-op is a strong aspect in Kirby games. Kirby Superstar I think is the strongest game in this collection, I got quite a rush taking down Meta-Knight's Ship.

Also included are extra challenge levels for ""Kirby's Return to Dreamland"" (original game not required), but it is a friendly poke to go and buy the previous release.

I wished the collection included more Kirby games, like Kirby's ""Nightmare in Dreamland"", or ""Kirby's Pinball Land"". Overall this is a great collection for any Kirby fan, could have been even better but since there is so much content, and runs complementary to the previous game ""Kirby's Return to Dreamland"" it is hard not to love it. I would give it 4.5 ""Warp-stars"" but since I had such a blast with Kirby I would say it can easily be rounded up to 5. If you're excited for the next Kirby game for the Wii U but having a hard time waiting, consider this collection and the other fine Kirby Wii games.",A great Kirby collection!

Being able to customize so many buttons into presets is probably my favorite part.  The mouse feels well built, but still light enough to move quickly and instinctively.  The other customization features includes changing the colors of the wheel, logo on the mouse, and the dock all independently.  I've only been using the mouse for a month, but it feels like it'll hold up for a long time.

Death in this game is a huge lesson so awareness is key for finishing this game.

The game has two disks.  Each character has there own 2 versians.  LEON has 2 different ways of the game.  There are the A and B games for each character.  LEON and CLAIR have both a's and b's.  I like all versians even though the b gives you an extendid deed to do in the game and shows you the true resident evil2 game ending wich leads to the events to resident evil 4!
The game disks should take about 6 to 9 hours if you don't have a guid. The a and b games are both pretty difficult if you don't have a guid.  The game is amazing and has a great character desighn like ada wong.  Sad how it ends for leon even thoe the b game leaves you wanderin about her during your fight with the new mutated tyrant in his b game.

B00503EAG2,5.0,"COD is a shooter game but I like to think of it as an first person extreme sports simulation. There's a lot of jumping, a lot of crashing, a lot of shooting. The story is basically Tom Clancy. I liked that stuff when I was a kid. Then I grew up. So it is kind of stupid, but it is the execution that matters, and the execution is tremendously good. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Uncharted, in the impressiveness of the events your character goes through.

Now, there are guns in this game. A big part of me is uneasy with the glorification of gun culture, still, in the series. but like Uncharted, the guns are there to give you a sense of danger and purpose while barreling through the levels. They are improved over the previous games quite a bit. The biggest improvement I find is the sound. You hear all the little squeaks and clicks of the guns as you reload and fire them. It's a reminder that these are intricate clock-like mechanical machines. I personally find the game most rewarding playing with an iron-sights AK47, M16, or MP5. There's also a weird new Russian gun called the PP90 that reloads using a tube.

As a side note, I had feared that this game's quality wouldn't be quite up to snuff after reading about some of the drama at Infinity Ward following MW2. Apparently, Activision had fired the two founders because the CEO was paranoid about them defecting to a rival publisher and taking employees with them. A very ham-fisted move it looks like to me, and the developer was decimated as like half the team left anyways following the Activision CEO's move. This is a case study on how not to treat talent and was completely unnecessary. It does seem that subtly this game is missing some of the creative risks that the first two Modern Warfare games took. There are more standardish-levels, fewer ""No Russian"" levels and more ""Red Dawn""-esque levels.

Another little thing I find interesting is that this game is deep down based on a very old Quake engine, the Quake 3 Arena engine from way back in the 1990's. They've grafted on various little improvements to the engine since then, and it's a great looking game, but you can still detect subtly how the movement feels like a Quake game from like how your mouselook accelerates when moving around to how collision detection works and moving up ladders.

I also would like to say that this is one superb piece of entertainment, even for those who aren't into video games that much. You don't have to think too much, which is actually a relief because I prefer to think about like astrophysics and not about how to beat some dumb RPG game element. It offers you just enough control so that you feel like you're in the game world more than you would a movie, but it also moves events along for you, which enables some of the more impressive extreme sports moments in the game. That it's all done in first person and not in cutscenes is what makes this series special.",First Person Extreme Sports

There are plenty of great games on it such as  Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time/Majora Mask, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Pokemon X/Y/Saphire/Ruby, Star Fox, Smash Bros, Fire Emblem Awakening, Animal Crossing, Bravely Default, Stella Glow, Rune Factory, Shovel Knight, Shin Megami Tensei, Devil's Survivors, Phoenix Wright, Street Fighter, and tons of JRPGs, and indie stuff on it. Definately worth it.",Got it on Cyber Monday and works great!

B00004WLMB,5.0,"Now I don't mean these games are going to be especially easy, but for those of us who lived and breathed the NES originals you're going to notice some pretty big differences right off the bat.

The first thing I noticed upon playing this version of DW1 was that you get much more gold pieces from killing enemies. Also, some of the old enemy placement zones are different- Remembering that I used to level up and head just north of the starting castle to kill Magicians for money I was quite surprised to learn that they no longer live there (they are still in the game, just another zone away). You can also use some items in battle that you couldn't before like how the Flame Sword casts a free blaze spell. As an aside: By the time you're able to afford and make the arduous journey to buy the Flame Sword your regular attacks will deal much more damage than this magic. Maybe they have it for Ye Olde Tantagel Party Tricks and Etc, who knows?

P.S. #1: Oh and don't go into the game thinking that DW1's metal slimes (Metalies) are going to give you thousands of XP like future games do or you'll be slightly disappointed.

DW2 though is a vast improvement over the original as far as I can tell. I've played almost every Dragon Warrior / Quest game and though part 2 is not my absolute favorite (a tie between 3 and 9) I can for sure say it's the HARDEST of them all, without a doubt. So enemies will still try to kill your healer first, and you'll sill have your kamikaze gold batboons who can instantly kill your entire party.. And be prepared for a lot of searching the entire world over just to figure out the next step on your quest. But all this feels a bit more fair this time as you're now given barrels and drawers to search through that can reward stat seeds to increase your powers more than in the NES version. So the Cave to Rhone is still a hardship worthy of song, but made a bit more bearable.

I will say though that trying to follow the Prince of Cannock around to get him to join your party is a giant PITA, as you have to hit all the right programming flags in the correct order (Castle -> Spring -> other Castle -> Leftwyne Town or something like that) or you'll be stuck on the beginning continent 'til the cows come home.

P.S. #2: T'was a ripe merry cannock-green FedEx quest from the days of olde indeed!","Improved gameplay, at the cost of some of the challenge."

B00HQY9FIG,5.0,My son loves this case.  I gave it to him for his 7th birthday and he was so excited. The art on the case as well as the case itself is of very high quality. He was especially excited that it could hold 8 games! His last case could only hold 3. It has an insert that allows the case to snugly hold a 3DS or take the insert out and it fits a 3DSXL like a glove. No shifting or movement at all. I'm pretty sure you could drop this case with your system in it from a 10 story building and the system would totally survive. Awesome product.,"Yeah, this is a great case! You should get one."

B000A3ON64,5.0,"It's da bomb! The graphics are as realistic as it gets and every bit of your brain can be used. When you're on a submission, there's one of four pain choices to choose from (drain, submit, taunt, and rest). Your opponent must choose the same choice as you in order to escape the hold.

The new stamina is slightly awesome. almost every move you make reduces your stamina a bit. Sounds bad? Actually, it's part of the realism. See, once your stamina's gone, your person gets tired and weakens everything. But, a good rest will restore your stamina.

Story mode continues where the first DoR left off. Your titles gone, and you must win it back. Although one of the main objectives is winning the championship, another thing is important to the storyline, and that's a personnal rivalry. I not at that part yet because i'm stuck on Summerslam, a nearly impossible match (a fatal-four-way cage)

CAW is top-notch, but a bit inferior to the first DoR, because in order to access a move, you must raise a stat attribute. And many must be raised quite high.

Anyway, this game rules. When it comes to getting this game, TRUST NO ONE!

B00008KA4E,5.0,"I knew it would take a great game to pull me away from Age of Mythology which I've been playing like an addict for over 6 months now.  This is the game I was waiting for.  As a veteran Player of both the Civilization series (and the far superior Alpha Centauri) and Age Of Empire series, the similarities to both series was immediately obvious.  It shoudln't come as any surprise since this game was built under the Microsoft banner (makers of the AOE series) but developed by former Civilization creators. The end result is a game so close to perfection you are forced to wonder why no one had though of it earlier.
While the gameplay is real time, most of the interface concepts and strategy has been adopted from turn based strategy.  Basically combat plays like AOE, but city management plays like CIV.  It's the best of both worlds really. The depth of research, complex alliances combined with shrewd AI make this one of the deepest real-time strategy games ever made.  Probably the deepest.  The use of nukes, aircraft, and huge armies result in huge bloody battles that every real-time player looks for.
One of the best concepts taken from the turn based games is the way cities are the key to conquest.  Cities can be raided and completely taken over by hostile armies.  Cities determine the size and shape of national borders.  Operating outside of national borders causes your troops to suffer attrition damage if improperly equipped.  Therefore, real-time players used to ""rushing' will find they must adopt a whole new strategy.  Armies might be the key to conquest, but it's developement that will govern their success.
There are two basic modes to the single player game: quick battle and the campaign.  Players of the campaign will notice similarities to another hybrid type series: Total War.  There is a huge world map where armies can be moved around like game pieces.  After making your moves, the game goes into real time mode with objectives based on the decisions and moves you made previously.  Unlike Total War where the real time is strictly combat, the real time portion of the game also forces you to build resources and raise armies if necessary.  Exceptional victories are rewarded with game cards that can be played prior to going real time, another added bonus that gives depth to the game.
While their are few real ground-breaking concepts in this game, by taking the best concepts of some of the greatest strategy games ever made is a bold leap forward.  Also, after playing Age of Mythology and Warcraft 3 with their beautiful 3D engines, the 2d graphics are a step back, but it's easily forgiven.  I've been playing this game for awhile now, and it seems like I learn somethign new every time I play.  Liek the best strategy games, there are a lot of layers and a lot of different paths to victory.  Any strategy game fan should pick this one up regardless of their preferences.",Civilization meets Age of Empires
B00002CF81,5.0,"Okay, I know that title isn't very fitting for a Jane's game.  However, previous to this the most detailed flight sim I had ever played was Freespace 2, and yes, I know that's not even a flight sim.  I'm just making an example.  However, as a novice to the genre, I bought F/A-18 and was immediately intimidated by the extent of detail in the game.  Moreover, as thin as the tutorial actually is, it at least provides you with some sort of a basis to work with.  If you search the web long enough, you will find that there are a plethora of customized training missions that will teach you every important nuance of flying the F/A-18, so that you will at least be a functional pilot.
Second, other than the controls and learning time needed, F/A-18 is a wonderful looking game.  I have a mere Celeron 400 with a ATI Rage card, and the game still played at a fine speed with minimal slowdown once I toned down the level of detail.  For that matter, the game still looked wonderful, the explosions were great, fire and sunlight reflecting inside of my cockpit.
If you want to get into flying REAL flight sims, like me, take a shot at F/A-18 and be prepared to spend some time learning.  It'll take a while, but figuring out how to play these kind of games is a more than worthwhile reward.  F/A-18 is a great example of Flight Sims at the top of their game.  Buy it, learn it, revel in it's quality, reap the rewards of knowledge.",Even Great For Novices

B000CR27OS,5.0,"Open For Business adds a new dimension to the Sims 2 gameplay.  While the general style of the game is an open-ended sandbox where you just do whatever you want, this expansion is more goal-oriented, by allowing you to build up a business empire for your sims.

One thing that's worth noting as a downside is that if you want to run a business at an actual commercial lot, you'll have to travel to and from it on a regular basis.  So, if loading screens bug you severely, keep in mind that the only way to avoid them would be to run nothing but home-based businesses.  (Having the ability to own a car from the Nightlife expansion helps a bit, since it at least saves you the waiting-for-taxi time.)

The new workstations where you create toys, flower arrangements, and robots are nice and produce some useful items.  You could even scrape along funding a sims life by creating items with one of these and then immediately selling them (either from manipulating the station or just dropping the item in buy mode).  The profits this way are much smaller than you're likely to get from customers interacting with a good salesman, but you can get by.

But retail and service-based businesses are possible, and even possible on the same lot, which gives you a great deal of flexibility in creating the business you want to run.  Nearly every object in the game is capable of being sold through stores, and if you want to build an entertainment facility where sims pay to hang out, anything that makes them feel like sticking around can be good for business.

It's nice to feel like you can actually participate in the way your sim earns a living, rather than just watching him go off to work every day to do something mysterious.

Remember to check the Sims 2 website for patches!",Great Fun

B00KF7BE7G,5.0,"This mostly just a review on the 2033 Redux portion of the Metro Redux. On Xbox 360, I picked up Last Light in the back end of the summer just looking for something to play and I heard great things about it. It soon became one of the best games I played of 2013. Looking back I enjoyed it way more than smash hits GTAV, and Bioshock Infinite. The game had one of the most unique game worlds, and I loved that it had a more realistic post-apocalyptic approach in terms of humanity's struggle to survive. After beating Last Light, I definitely wanted to pick up 2033 down the road, but with the slew of new games, and the next gen consoles I held off. Then the Redux was announced for Xbox One and PS4. Now when I saw that I could get 2033 Redux separately on the digital Xbox Store, I picked it up. Now Metro is a game praised for its story and I really enjoyed 2033's story just like did Last Light, but nothing ever shocked me or anything since having played Last Light, I knew the key plot points from 2033. It it still a great story, but having known what happened at the end, I never got excited. Yet due to the gameplay and the game's atmosphere drew me in. Metro across is by far my favorite atmospheric game. The sound, the lighting, and the environments you play through just suck you in. Navigating the dark Metro with just a flashlight and a lighter adds for some intense experiences. Nothing is more intensifying when you are going through a level and you hear the roar of a nosalise ahead. You are in for trouble and its time to prepare. That is what I love about Metro. The game just sucks you in, and you really feel like you are a part of the environment. Having a stereo headset just adds to the experience. Now gameplay wise it plays just like Last Light. The basically took Last Light's gameplay and implemented it into 2033. What I like is the two play styles you pick when starting a new game . There is spartan where its more like Last Light where it focuses more to be a action packed FPS and then there is survival which plays like the classic 2033 survival style where you really need to scavenge for ammo and supplies. 2033 to me is the highlight of the Redux since 4A Games basically redesigned the game in terms of the gameplay and graphics. It has completely new textures and it plays like Last Light now. It is a fantastic game, but I still prefer Last Light since it has more depth such as more above surface levels which are some of the more intense levels. Thats where 2033 to me misses. It has very few above surface levels which is where the game really comes into play graphically and is more key to me in the survival aspect with the use of the gas mask and such. Last Light basically perfects upon 2033. I understand now the impact of 2033 and the ground it laid for Last Light. If you haven't played any Metro game or you've only played one of the two I heavily recommend this game if interested. Plus if you just want one of the games you can get it separately digitally for 24.99$. Metro is a great game, and one of the most unique games ever made, not just in the FPS genre, but games in general.",Metro Redux is One of The Best Deals in Gaming This Year

So you have to act as basically a military slave who is constantly told that you are expendable and you aren't like a useful civilian.  So this means you have to buy entitlements like the right to remain silent or even run for above five seconds.  It does a good job at making you feel for the characters even your own.

B000GIXIPK,5.0,"It's a safe bet that when Konami creates a Castlevania for a handheld that it's going to be pretty good.  Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is no exception, and while it doesn't do much we haven't seen before in the series, it still manages to pack one heck of a punch.  Following up the wonderful Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin puts you in the shoes of Jonathan and Charlotte; a whip and magic wielding duo that you play as together throughout the game.  This new dynamic adds some spice to the tried but true side scrolling gameplay, which is rich with a horde of weapons, items, and power-ups to find.  And, since this is a Castlevania game, it's only natural that the boss battles are nothing short of fantastic and the best parts of the game.  The graphics look sharp with superb animation and effects that really show off what the DS is capable of with 2-D graphics.  The music and sound is superb as well, and the game offers some decent touch screen capabilities that are more substancial than the ones found in Dawn of Sorrow.  If there's any cons to Portrait of Ruin, it's that the level designs don't have that personality that we've seen in previous Castlevania games like Dawn of Sorrow and the GBA titles, but that's not a huge gripe.  All in all, Portrait of Ruin is another superb portable Castlevania game, and yet another must own title for the DS.",More Castlevania on the go?  Count me in

B000PS4X7S,5.0,"I had the choice between the PC version and the 360 version.  I chose the PC version because of three reasons: faster patching of bugs, free DLC, user-created DLC.  While the 360 offers better graphical stability, most PC's should be able to run it (it's built on the 4-year-old Source engine) and the mouse and keyboard provide better precision than a console controller.

Be ready to have a good mic hooked up as communication is key when it comes to teamwork.  Your band of 4 survivors must team up to accomplish tasks and take down certain enemies (like the Tank, a cross between a gorilla, the Hulk, and a zombie).  Friendly fire is also an issue; be careful where you shoot and watch those molotov cocktails (you don't want to set fire to the wrong thing, like a teammate).

This is quite possibly the best PC game of the year and one of the most intense and enjoyable co-op survival horror shooters ever made.  Make sure you play with others as playing with bots is not nearly as fun.",Some of the best online co-op

B0012N2AB6,5.0,"First of all, I've only been playing the demo so far so my review is based on that experience.  I've been playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3 almost daily since it came out in 1999 and this is the first turn based strategy game I've played since then that measures up to the fun of HOMM 3 (including HOMM 4 & 5, neither of which I liked).  There are more RPG elements in this game than in HOMM 3.  You gather quests from various characters, complete the quests and gain experience.  Combat is turn based and you can cast spells and use the Rage box, which calls various monsters to your aid for an attack during combat as long as you have enough Rage points.  This is very cool with great graphics and can cause massive damage to your enemy, allowing you to turn the tide of battle if your enemy is stronger than you.  Graphics are great and gameplay is very intuitive.  My only complaint so far is the game has locked up my system a couple of times, but the problem may be on my end so who knows.  I highly recommend this game and will be ordering it soon.","If you liked HOMM, you'll love this!"

B001TOQ8X4,5.0,"Having read about bugs and hacking I figured i'd wait to get the game. Unfortunately my friend bought the game before I was planning to so I went ahead and got it about a month after it's release. I was afraid I'd have trouble linking my account but it was actually pretty easy and smooth... maybe I did miss the horror story of launch. one thing I'll mention is that when you link your two account, you use the same login info for both games.

The game is great. I can spend hours just running around in an area while events just pop up and I can work with other people without teaming with them... AND nobody has complained or yelled at me for it. Sometimes it's hard to know where to go next, but I've found that the personal storyline keeps you moving and branching out. I think people that like the old MMO style of following quests that lead you in the direction you need to go will appreciate the personal storyline. I will say that even though I've played GW1, GW2 is very new to me so I'm still learning stuff and trying to figure out which profession I want to play. Thankfully there's no monthly subscription fee so I can take my time and experiment all I want.

EDIT 12/27/2012

Now that I've been playing the game for a few months I have a couple criticisms of the game...

First - the personal story.  I haven't completed the personal story with any character yet, but I've gotten pretty high with three different characters and it's pretty repetitive.  Basically you can make decisions as to what you want to do or what path you want to go down, but it all feels the same.  All paths seem to lead in the same direction and every path feels the same in what you're basically going to do.  To me this hurts the replay of the game to a degree.  I say to a degree and not completely because you really don't have to do the personal story if you don't want to.

Second - LFG option (or lack there of).  I'm in a VERY small guild with only me and one other close friend and we've been unable to do any dungeons because the LFG option in the game is pretty non existent.  Sure you can stand around spamming in chat that you're looking for a group to do so and so, but if the game had a LFG option you could continue to play the game while waiting for a group.  A proper LFG option should be a basic feature in any MMO.

All things considered, I'd still recommend the game to anyone.  The game has no monthly fee.  It also appears that ArenaNet is planning on releasing free content every month... so far they have since I've been playing.  October was a huge Halloween event, November they released new content including a new Dungeon, and December we currently have Wintersday.  ANet is apparently going to release a full expansion's worth of content during the months of Jan and Feb so that's awesome if they can pull that off.",Happy to be in Tyria

B00004SVV9,5.0,"Many gamers consider this the best game in the NES library, and while I won't say that since I don't think I've played a wide enough array of games for that console to come up with such a conclusion, I'll say that this is my favorite game with the Mario title on it.  This is my favorite of all the Mario games since I think among Mario's ""classic"" games, this one is the toughest while still being fun and unlike the two previous Mario games, starts to include features that would be essential to future Mario games.

STORY

Bowser is back to unleash terror, but this time, he's brought his seven children, known as the Koopalings, to wreak havoc in seven kingdoms, and to steal the magic wands from those kingdoms for Bowser's nefarious plans.  Mario and Luigi have to go stop the Koopalings' invasion through their airships, retrieve the stolen magic wands and turn the transformed kings back to normal, and eventually, fight Bowser himself...again.

What I find most interesting with this storyline is that unlike most other Mario games, Princess Peach isn't immediately the ""damsel in distress,"" but rather in the beginning of most worlds you enter in the game, she supplies you with a power-up.  It's not until near the end of the game that she gets kidnapped by Bowser.

GAMEPLAY

SMB3's gameplay is a vast improvement over the previous two games.  If you're familiar with the gameplay mechanics of the first Super Mario Bros. (the American Super Mario Bros. 2 is pretty different, considering that it's merely Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters, and therefore has some pretty different gameplay mechanics, and I don't consider it a true sequel to SMB), then you know around 90% of Super Mario Bros. 3's mechanics.  The right and left buttons on the d-pad make you walk right and left (respectively), Start pauses the game, B launches an attack (if you have a power-up that dishes out attacks), A makes you jump, and the Select button is restricted to the title screen to toggle between 1 and 2-player modes.

Throughout the game, you navigate through eight different worlds and have to complete a number of levels until you reach the end of the overworld map (usually you have to beat each level in order to get to the end of the map, but you can sometimes skip a level if there's an alternate, unblocked route), which features a castle with a transformed king and a Toad in distress, asking you to retrieve the magic wand from the Koopaling you have to fight.

The eight lands in the order of progression in the game are Grass Land, Desert Land, Water Land, Giant Land, Sky Land, Ice Land, Pipe Land, and Dark Land.  The respective Koopalings you have to fight in these kingdoms are Larry Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr. Wendy O. Koopa, Iggy Koopa, Roy Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, and Ludwig von Koopa (you fight Bowser in Dark Land).  With the exception of Bowser, you fight each of them on giant airships, that are often bristling with cannons and flamethrowers.

In the individual levels within the eight worlds you travel, they're quite varied.  There's ""regular"" levels where you travel through a level on the world's surface while jumping over obstacles and defeating enemies.  There's ""sky"" levels where you have to traverse through platforms above a giant bottomless pit, and these are often ""auto-scrolling,"" so make sure you're staying ahead of the screen's movement towards the right.  There's levels where you have to go down a pipe and swim through water, and there's levels where you have to go down a pipe and traverse through an underground level.  Aside from that, there' also smaller castles within each world that you have to beat.  These castles often have lava pools and jumping fireballs much like the castles in the first Mario game, and in the end of each, you have to fight a reptilian creature known as a Boom Boom, though these guys are often easy to defeat.

There's also optional places in each world you can visit.  These include ""mushroom houses"" that when you visit them, you choose from one of three chests to pick up a power-up and a location where you try to align three images to win a power-up (the power-ups you can win are a mushroom, leaf, or fireflower).  Sometimes, a moving card will appear on the map and you can play cards to win things like coins, extra lives, and power-ups by flipping cards and matching two of a kind to win something.  Once in a blue moon, a ship will appear on the map and when you get on it, you just collect a ton of coins and you go down a pipe in the end to fight two Hammer Bros..

In each map, you'll bump into the Hammer Bros., and when you beat the two of them, you'll get a power-up.

There's a smorgasbord of enemies you fight in this game. As usual, you got the Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, and Buzzy Beetles, but there's some more this time around. Some of the new enemies are the Chain Chomp (when I was a little kid, I thought these were spastic football helmets that hurt you), Boo, Dry Bones (the Koopa Troopa skeletons in the fortresses), baby Piranha Plants (these are capable of jumping), Thwomps (the blocks in the fortresses that try to crush you), and Buster Beetles (the beetles that can throw Ice Blocks at you).

There's a bunch of new power-ups as well.  Along with the fireflower, there's the leaf, which allows you to fly after attaining a high-enough speed.  There's also the Tanooki suit, which like the leaf, allows you to fly, but also allows you to turn into a statue for protection against enemies (and can defeat otherwise invincible adversaries like the rotating lights and fireballs in the fortresses).  There's a frog suit that allows you to swim better in underwater levels.  Among the ""best"" power-ups are the P-wing, which is similar to the leaf, but allows you to constantly fly without having to run and fill up the P-meter (and flight ability doesn't run out unless if you get hit by an enemy).  My favorite power-up is the Hammer suit, since this makes you throw hammers that can defeat nearly all enemies (such as the Boos and smashing blocks, which are invincible to tailspin attacks and fireballs), and when you crouch, the shell on the back of your suit protects you from fireball attacks.  Because of how potent the Hammer suit it, it's only natural for it to be the rarest power-up in the game.

GRAPHICS

SMB3 is a step up in graphics compared to its two predecessors.  Because of the more diverse environments, each world has a distinct visual style.  With the graphical improvements, Mario and Luigi look better than in the previous two games, and the same can be said for all of the creatures in the game.  Also, there's a much wider array of colors used in this game, and this game helped set the stage for what is now Mario's signature polychromatic worlds and creatures (while the first two SMB games had color, the color range wasn't very large).  I think some of the best-looking environments in this game are for Ice Land and Dark Land.  The former for the fact that it really does look and invoke the feeling of a chilly world (and to be humorous, I bet this is what Mario and Luigi would imagine what countries like Russia and Finland are like) and the latter for its really ominous, bleak atmosphere.  Thanks to the wider array of colors, it helps flesh out each world as very distinctive from the other, which is a great thing considering how varied each of the eight worlds are.

SOUND/SOUNDTRACK

A lot of the sound effects from the first two Mario games have been carried over into SMB3, such as the coin sounds, enemy-smashing sounds, and the fireball sounds.  These sounds are quite effective, given the NES's hardware limitations.

The soundtrack for SMB3 is some of Koji Kondo's best work yet.  There's more Overworld themes instead of just one, and the well-known Underworld theme has been ""spiced up"" in this game (and it sounds better).  Two of my favorite themes in this game are the Fortress and Air Ship themes.  The former makes you feel like you're in a hideous dungeon where hundreds of innocents are met with horrible fates and the latter has a percussive, militaristic aesthetic.  In one of the levels in Dark Land, you have to traverse through a squad of tanks, and with the ominous black background and Air Ship theme in the background, it feels like a squad of German heavy tanks is pouring into the Soviet Union circa 1941.

COMPLAINTS

I only have a few complaints with Super Mario Bros. 3.  My chief complaint with this game is that for how challenging and lengthy it is, there's no saving feature in the game.  So this means you gotta devote a huge chunk of your day to beat this thing since you gotta do it all in one sitting.

The difficulty curve among the last three Koopalings is a little off.  Fighting Roy Koopa is pretty difficult since he can shake up the ground, temporarily immobilizing you if you're on the ground.  However, Lemmy is after him, and fighting him is almost as easy as fighting Larry and Morton, but with Ludwig coming after Lemmy, the difficulty spikes up drastically.

The other is more minor, but it does irk me a little.  Why are the Boos invincible to fireballs but not so to hammers?  Theoretically, ghosts are supposed to be gaseous entities, so wouldn't fire be a more logical element in defeating them rather than metal projectiles?

FINAL WORD

This is surely a classic in the NES library, and easily among the best of all Mario games.  This game is available on the Wii's virtual console (and has been re-issued on various handhelds over the last decade or so), so you can play it on there.  However, if you're more of an old-school gamer, you may find yourself dusting off your NES and SMB3 cartridge to play this one again.  Regardless of what method you like to play this game on, give it another whirl.",My favorite of all Mario games.  94%

(Very little bad and ugly as far as I am concerned)

I read the other reviews on this game and my mind is boggled about what is being said about the graphics. Imo the graphics in this game are good. I can't imagine what anyone means when they say they are lacking. Lacking what? The graphics are SIMPLISTIC, yes, but still good graphics. I compare the graphics to the gamecube version and they are 100% better than those. They are supposed to be simplistic, so from what I can see, they are just fine. I find the music to be a bit annoying, just wish there was an option to turn it off or down.

I think the best part of this game is the fact that you have on line play available to you and not like the Xbox, you don't have to pay a yearly fee to use the Nintendo servers! The game is very interactive with other players and just adds to the addiction of the game. The other thing I like the best about the game is that you can still be playing it a year later and still have not completed collecting all the items! When you do finally complete it, hang on cuz you have 3 more players added to your town you need to complete! Go from friends towns to towns and see all the inventive imagination they use when decorating and setting up their towns.

In the end, I really hope they continue this series on the Xbox one because it is one of my all time favorites, or at the very least make it compatible with Xbox one.",EA needs to continue this series...

B0050SWBAE,5.0,"Pikmin 3 is the first game in the series for Wii U. Originally designed for Wii but then upgraded for the Wii U The graphics are amazing. You will be shocked seeing them and the fruit is just beautiful to look at. As Another reviewer suggested using the Wii remote and nunchuk to play this game is recommended but you should use the Wii U gamepad as well with that. The Wii U gamepad offers extra info and can be used as a map and reference point in the game, should you get lost or need some guidance. Logs are also on the screen and provide much more info on the happenings in the game. I would suggest further using the Wii Motion plus as it doesn't need to be pointed exactly at the screen unlike the standard wiimote but either are good.
This game feels like a merger of sorts between Pikmin 1 and 2. It has a sort of time limit but can be worked around completely with some skill and eventually it doesn't become an issue leaving exploration open. You will want to explore every last bit of the game to see everything. As another reviewer stated, you have 3 crew members that you switch around and that makes the game more interesting for me. It made the gameplay more unique and open and also funny with the way the character interact each is different in their own way and its wonderful to see.

Also included is the multiplayer Bingo battle and while its not online, its still a fun experience. This mode is addictive and if you have friends over, is a must play. I played this with a friend and we had a blast.

The real beauty of Pikmin is that it accomplishes what most games try and fail to do. It lets you feel for the characters and know what is going on. And it does this without cut scenes, when a Pikmin dies, you feel it. Show Don't Tell is clearly done well here. But more than that, in a gaming industry filled with shooters and games that call themselves hardcore, a game like Pikmin 3 is a refreshing change of pace and truly one of the best games out there right now.

If you are on the fence about the Wii U, this game is just the start of many more games coming including the Wonderful 101, sonic lost world, donkey kong country tropical freeze and Mario 3D world. All are going to be amazing. This is a good start to a Wii U collection.","A Refreshing Change of Pace From Most Games,  And Thats Good."

B00D2ZK2Q2,5.0,"A very enjoyable game. I really like open world environments which this world does well (perhaps not quite as well as Bethesda but still pretty good.) The game has a heavy emphasis on movement. You're really meant to be running and jumping through the environment at all times and because you'll face hoards of the undead between point A and B, you'll be spending a good amount of time jumping across rooftops, vehicles, walls and other obstacles. The game styles itself as a ""parkour"" game however, you won't be doing many of the truly fancy moves that I think of when I think of parkour (jumping from wall to wall in an alley, hitting and rolling, etc). It's much more basic running and jumping.

Fighting can be a big part of the game or you can choose to mostly avoid it although there will be situations where it's unavoidable. Weapons continue to level up throughout the game but the zombie hoards also seem to grow.",Fun game that keeps you moving in an open world environment

B00C9UND8K,5.0,"Well after about a year of using the Tritton AX 180 which was an amazing headset, it unfortunately broken and I was looking to replace them but this time I wanted a Playstation Exclusive headset. When I looked around and saw the new P11 headset at $50 I decided to purchase them. I just got them today and they are just as good as my AX 180.

PROS
1. Oversized 50mm Speakers, it bass from these headset are amazing.  Just the bass from a gunfire or grenade sounds incredible.
2. Lightweight, it feels are if I have nothing on sometimes. It does feel solid like it can take some pressure but I still strengthen them with foam but they should last along time.
3. Long cord, with atleast 12 feet of cording more than enough to play from your couch or anywhere in the room.

CONS
1. Hissing sound, it is not a problem when I am in gameplay but like when in loading or anywhere silent you can hear this hissing noise in the background. It does not bother me at all just something that I hear.
2. Small design, I had to turn the headset the other way around cause the correct way it would not fit on my ears. I could of raised them but I hate messing with that cause it might damage the wire.
3. Mic, with my Tritton and most of my headset the the mic holes face your mouth so you can choose if you want to put your mic on the right or left side but this one has the holes on the top which I hate. You can still hear yourself even if you turn it the other way but it just feels weard.

Overall this headset is worth the $50 I payed for them, compared to other which cost $80+ they definately match up to them. I would definately recommend you pick one up if you need a cheap but good sounding headset",My P11 Review

B001IK1BWC,5.0,"Before diving into the review, a brief summary: Dragon Age Origins is the epic role playing game that many of us have been waiting for since we first fell in love with the genre with the classic Baldur's Gate. It drops the player into an immersive fantasy world rich with lore and compelling settings. The aesthetics and score are as pleasing and engrossing as a good cinematic feature or novel. And while it is spectacular in just about every way, it is not without its faults (mostly technical in nature, and affects players with very specific computer hardware as far as I can tell - I'll explain more later). In short, if you're a fan of the genre you will do yourself a favor by purchasing and experiencing this game. I have never felt more comfortable suggesting a RPG to the Internet-at-large as I do right now with Dragon Age. I will swear upon whatever holy text you prefer that it's the best single-player RPG to come along since Fallout 3. If you're not a theist, I suppose I could place my hand upon a photograph of Carl Sagan before making the same solemn vow. But I digress. Onto the review. Aspects I found positive are preceded by a (+), negative aspects a (-).

GAME PLAY
(+) Dragon Age (hereby referred to as ""DA"") plays like a perfect hybrid of turn-based and real-time RPGs of yore. The controls are a mash up of overhead tactical maneuvering ala Baldur's Gate and the third-person RTS-like mechanics found in Knights of the Old Republic. You control character movement with either the WASD keyboard directions familiar to MMO and FPS players, or via mouse-click navigation (concurrently). You can play from a third-person perspective to get a full view of the world around you, or zoom out into an overhead tactical view to aid in unit placement and positioning (in which the graphics take on the painted look and feel of Baldur's Gate - a nice touch). The camera may be controlled with either the keyboard or mouse. All around, stellar.

(+) The UI makes a powerful and elegant use of economy of space (it fits a lot into a little, all while looking and playing extremely well)

(+) Character customization is as rich if not richer than any other RPG hybrid or pure RPG on the market - past or present. You have standard archetypes (warrior, mage, rogue) which alone have various ""trees"" or avenues of progression focusing upon things like weapon preference (sword + shield, dual wield, two-handed, etc) or general and crafting skills. In addition there are specialist classes that excel at specific vocations (such as the mage-nullifying Templar, shape shifting mage, or crit-happy Duelist - to name a few). On top of this, special abilities and vocations may be unlocked by finding rare items or special quests (often a combination of both)

(+) Combat is highly tactical, taking into account elevation, range, ""crowd control"" mechanics, and vast synergy between the abilities of your party members

(+) A deep tactics system can be utilized, in which you assign a custom AI to each of your characters based upon a variety of criteria and situations. For example, you can tell your mage that every time they're surrounding by two or more melee mobs, they cast a certain crowd control spell. If a party member has less than 50% health, heal them. Or have your tank taunt mobs that attack the mage. Or have the rogue stun the mobs your main character is fighting. Etc.

(-) Melee-centric characters draw from a pool of stamina to perform their various abilities and group-enhancing skills. This pool feels very limited, even when you invest heavily into the stat that grants more stamina. It's further hampered by injuries that your characters will sustain, on occasion, while fighting (which are treated with injury kits or by resting at your camp). Hopefully this will be tweaked in a future patch.

STORY, PRESENTATION, & SETTING
(+) The seemingly hackneyed story (you`re the last in a long line of sacred warriors who's mission is to vanquish a very particular foe) quickly unfolds into a compelling, immersive, and interesting tale that rivals those found in quality fantasy novels and movies. Each race, town, city, and region are wholly unique and diverse - from the political intrigue of Dwarven society to the juxtaposition of the city and forest Elves (and the layers of complexity involved therein). I can't go too much into this without potentially spoiling the many excellent stories. Suffice to say, it's superb.

(+) While the world isn't technically ""open"", being divided into many instanced zones (if you will), it is nevertheless truly vast. Most areas are substantially large. There is no limit to draw distance: your viewing distance is essentially to infinity, and most zones can be fully explored to the smallest nook and cranny (and it pays to do so). You unlock more areas as the game progresses (and the areas vary depending upon your origin and choices), and there's a complete underground zone in addition to the zone all non-Dwarves start within.

(+) The story is always evolving and changing. Your most minor, or major, decisions regarding plot or character interactions will have lasting repercussions that may not come to fruition for some time. You can build intimate relationships with characters, and being an active participant in the dialogue and lore pay huge dividends in the end

(+) Replayability is very high - due largely to the aforementioned dynamic story, as well as the ""Origins"" part of the DA title: different race and class combinations have different starting stories, and merge into the overall arc in different ways and at different times

PERFORMANCE
(+) The games looks, sounds, and plays perfectly well on middling hardware

(-) If you own a dual or quad core AMD CPU, expect gradually increasing load times as your session time increases (the longer you play and the more you transition between zones, the longer the load times become). From 5 to 7 seconds at first, upwards of 5 minutes after 45 minutes to an hour of play. This can be resolved by restarting the game, which literally only takes about 20 seconds. But still, it's frustrating, and many people are reporting it on the official forums. Hopefully it will be patched.

(-) The first PC patch was a bit of a goof: the new build included a newer version of the Visual C++ 2005 runtime, while the retail version had an older build. The result was that many people couldn't launch the game after patching. A trivial issue for the computer savvy (I just checked my event logs and saw the issue then patched), but the lay person would have no idea what's going on. After days Bioware has yet to respond officially with the obvious fix, leaving it to the community to resolve. That behavior and communication casts doubt upon the level of commitment Bioware has in regards to DA from a technical support perspective.

Overall, the few technical issues are far outweighed by the overall quality of the game. I would provide a more in-depth review, but I am honestly afraid that I'll accidentally spoil something, as this game is ridiculously vast. Buy this game. You will not be disappointed.",The best RPG of 2009

B002BSA20M,5.0,"awesome game, best of series (,& i have 4, a big waste after reach's greatness) i've had all 7, starting with 1 on xbox 1(my first xbox game). my fazsha started playing this big time with firefight(the 1st game he ever got into) firefight is completely awesome, any shooter that wants repeat contenders should have a similar mode(u can change difficulty , damage resistance ,& starting weapons/equipment). my only 2 qualm with it: 1 it completely deviated from the storyline(especialy book 3 which talks about spartans on reach,  brutes don't appear as early as reach,& cortana's a digital clone of halsey not a forerunner artifact).2 the inability to edit firefight maps on forge (more warthogs, all 3 kinds, would be a bit of awesomeness, instead of 1 rockethog on 1 map. the gameplay makes up for the bad story though. i think a great halo game would be a combination of team fortress 2,& unreal tournament, (for dreamcast, greatest system ever) bots for offline play.u could choose a heavy weapons guy who would move slow with body armor like in MW3,but have insane health,& damage capabilities(maybe he could have a reloadable detatched turret). medics who can drop health ,& ammo. snipers with far reach,but limited health. finaly some kind of assasin with very low health,but cloaking equipment,& fast running. i shouldn't need to say it,but hp should be reintroduced. just use reach's great gameplay,& halo 4's hi res graphics.
i know i said i didn't like xiii 2 mainly because of unrealistic story,but there is a big difference in rpg's ,& fps's(story doesn't matter quite so much on fps's , as long as great gameplay)",a must buy for any fps technophile

B000XGJH1O,5.0,"For all of you considering the PS3 this is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to home entertainment. Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level.

First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get two USB ports. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review.

I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.

You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.

Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use.

The PS3 also has a photo viewer.  You can download pictures by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is.  Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. One of the features takes your pictures and gracefully places them onto a blank canvas. I think the slide shows are best when you set them to music.

Next is the music player.  You can download your pics via CD which is rather quick.  I have done this numerous times putting quite a music collection on my PS3.  Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well. You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures. It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there.

I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Bluray player. Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier. The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture. For many of the new movies it is almost difficult to notice a difference in a DVD picture and Blu-ray picture.

Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. One feature that is sadly missing from the 40 gig is backwards compatibility.  Although you can still play PSone games, PS2 games are a no go.  As far as the games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football are deficent on the PS3 compared to XBox 360 counterparts. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword and Ratchet and Clank is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this holiday season and beyond. I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360.

Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. Which is obviously not very unique. The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. It did not work for me then. Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play.

There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners. Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University. The program runs when your PS3 is idle. What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases. A beneficial plus to the PS3. I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems. Secondly I want to talk about HOME. No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available early 2008. This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players. I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential.

2008 will be an exciting year for PS3 owners. The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games. The PS3 will have over a half dozen superb games releasing next year. Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy are just the beginning. If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3.

In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $400 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, HDMI, and of course the game playing.
I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.",A Leap Forward in So Many Ways!

B000FQ2D5E,5.0,"This review is going to make an assumption: that you've played at least one installment of a previous Metal Gear Solid title on the legendary PS2. In MGS4, reportedly the last game of the series, you take on the role of Solid Snake, now known as Old Snake, and attempt to do what you've done before: save the world from twisted people with deeply convoluted motives for being so nasty.

GRAPHICS
The MGS series has always tried to push the boundaries of what's possible with each console, and this game certainly follows in those (sneaky) footsteps. This is notable during the cut scenes, which are beautifully rendered. Often times these sequences merge directly into gameplay, with the camera rolling behind your back and the data for Old Snake fading up. There's no notable degredation of image during the move, which is a neat effect and really throws you into the game.

CONTROLS
Some slight shifts of button assignments makes sense, but may offset diehard MGS vets for a few minutes. Namely changing the X to align with the North American tradition of it meaning 'confirm' instead of the O button as is standard for the Japanese. Another huge change is that the L1 button (not the Square) is used to ready your weapon, while R1 functions as the trigger. Other than that, they should remain as familiar and slightly frustrating as in any of the old titles.

But don't think that you can't teach an Old Snake new tricks. One new move is being able to roll onto your back from a prone position and fire almost any weapon. Also, Snake can now perform a slow, undulating crawl that preserves your camoflauge rating whilst moving. Another feature is being able to 'play dead'. During one of my sessions I got pinned down close to the enemy line, and was hit by a random explosion that threw me out onto a road in view of enemy soldiers. To see what would happen I had Snake play dead. The enemy turned their attention to opposition forces, allowing me to equip a silenced sniper rifle and wreak havoc on them. Great fun!

GAMEPLAY
All very familiar, especially if you played as the source of all clones, Big Boss/Naked Snake in MGS3 Snake Eater. A fully movable camera allows you to get a 360 degree view of your surroundings. As far as actual gameplay, you know how this works by now. Many familiar weapons return, along with a few new CQC  (close quarters combat) techniques. Of course, MGS titles have always been about temptation - telling you to elude notice and make it through without confrontations, yet giving you a sweet arsenal of weapons just begging to be used. This title is no exception, and even ups the ante by increasing the amount of available firepower and allowing players to customize some of the weapons. Adding a shotgun or grenade launcher to my assault rifle? Priceless.

Numerous and lengthy cut scenes have been a staple of the series, and this is no exception. One nice feature added is being able to pause it by using the Start button, so if you need to use the bathroom after that boss battle you don't have to miss any of the labrynthian plot or blow out your bladder. A new 'interactive' feature occasionaly featured during cut scenes is flashback memories, indicated by an X button prompt. Pushing the button repeatedly shows images of what he's thinking about, and awards Drebin Points at the end of each Act.

Drebin Points? Yep, you read that correctly. Drebin is a weapons dealer. After you first meet him, his shop can be accessed at any time through the menu. This is where you can go to buy weapons, ammo and upgrades using your Points. As enemies now drop their weapons, you can collect them to add to your arsenal. After the first time, Drebin automatically buys the duplicate weapon from you, and you get to keep the ammo. Woot!

SOUND
As always, this is well done and really puts you into the action. Whether it's the explosions, gunfire and ricochets of a battle zone, or the wind and birds of a woodland, you'll feel immersed in the enviroment. A new item to start the game with is an iPod, which has numerous songs to listen to while making your way through the game. You can, of course, also acquire new songs by finding them during the game, some of which have an effect on gameplay while you're listening to them.

OVERALL
A great installment in the series and a perfect ending to the MGS series. Many familiar faces from previous titles show up, or get a mention, during this final curtain call. This game is just plain fun, whether on a no-kill sneak through or a full frontal assault. Not to mention it's unique and quirky sense of humor. And I didn't even touch on the sweet Metal Gear Online where you can battle other players in various game formats (Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Sneaking Mission, etc.).

B0000296O5,5.0,"As a girl obsessed with the likes of Zelda: The Ocarina Of Time, I was completely unfamiliar with turn based RPGs.  When I recieved Final Fantasy 7 and 8 for Christmas, I naturally tried 7 first.  I was horrified when I saw that you were unable to run around in a free roaming enviornment hacking and slashing at your leisure.  Waiting my turn to deliver one blow was not my idea of a good time.  Disgusted, I removed the game and inserted FF8.  I was floored by the opening cinema.  When the game started, I was confused by all the new terms.  SeeD?  Balamb Gatrden?  Junction system?  What the hell?  But something compelled me to push onward.  I was instantly hooked on the characters, which to me are much more appealing than the lego characters of the previous Final Fantasy games.
 You play as the quiet lone wolf, 17 year old Squall Leonheart, a member of a group of mercenaries for hire known as SeeD.  SeeDs reside in academys known as Gardens.  When an evil sorceress gains the trust of President Deling and the people of Galbadia, Squall along with fellow SeeDs the perky Selphie Tilmitt, the loudmouthed Zell Dincht, the ladies' man Irvine, and the recently fired 18 year old instructer Quistis Trepe set out to assasinate her.  Along the way, the lively and beautiful Rinoa Heartilly, a member of a resistance faction known as The Forest Owls teams up with them.  Along the way, she struggles to bring down Squall's icy exterior and help him voice his feelings.  The plot soon throws many curveballs, eventually bringing forth issues such as romance, possesion, time compression, prison abuse and escape, and traveling into the future.
 I will admit that this game is extremely ambitious and has its flaws.  The very different reviews serve to prove one thing: it depends wholly on the person whether or not you'll enjoy this game.  Some people enjoy the game enough to get by its flaws and appreciate its differences, while others simply don't have the time or patience for it.  It depends on your personality.  Before buying, you must understand that:
-This is a love story
-The junction system (attatching magic to stats such as strength and HP to raise or lower the stat depending on magic type and quantity) takes a long time to understand and get fully confortable with.  No other FF has had a system like this, and you may not like it
-You need to play through FOUR discs and have the time to put in upwards of 70 hours in order to get through everything the game has to offer.  Patience is important.
 While I am an impatient person who gets put to sleep by other RPGs, I enjoyed Final Fantasy 8 a lot.  The characters meant something to me because they were realistic looking and typical teens rather than lego people with absent mouths.  This is the black sheep of the series, and not everyone will appreciate it.  In my case, it will always remain a favorite.  For its time, no game was more gorgeous looking and emotional, and no final battle was as long and intense.  The stunning ending clocks in at around a half hour.  But some people aren't bothered by the long frequent GF summons, and some are extremely bothered by them.  I can understand it.  As I said, it all depends what kind of person you are.",Sickeningly underrated

B0002XL3BA,5.0,"God of War is one of those games you have to own if you have a PS2.  It's got great graphics, a compelling story line, tight controls, and is just plain fun to play.  If you have a PS3, consider picking up the disk with both God of War 1 & 2 on it.

In GOW you taken on the persona of a Spartin who committed a horrible act and has been trying to wipe the slate clean and remove  his tortured visions by serving the gods.  You don't know much about his history when things start, but you learn his story in dribs and drabs as you go.  The story is compelling and it makes you want to keep going a little further to learn more.  Your situation ultimately compells you to try to defeat the God of War.

One thing GOW is not though is a kid's game.  Unless you have a really mature kid, you should probably not be letting your kids play this game until they're at least in their mid-teens.  In addition to the violence, of which there is pleny, there is also frontal nudity (toppless) and one mini-game where you are pleasuring two prostitutes.  If it were a movie, GOW would be R or NC17.

The mechanics are pretty straight forward for a PS2 game.  You have attacks, blocks, jump, etc.  You have to do some puzzles from time to time and there are a fair number of button pushing mini-games where pushing the correct sequence makes you pull off some cool looking cinematic move.  Sometimes these are optional and just make a battle easier, but often they're required to win a fight.  Many games have copied this feature and a lot of times they will make you concentrate so hard you miss the cool moves on screen (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leisure-Suit-Larry-Magna-Cum-Laude/dp/B00023B1SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a>), but GOW is pretty forgiving on the timing to press the button so it never really frustrates you too much.  Even when it was difficult, I considered it to be fair and not cheap.  I also never really had much trouble figuring out where to go next.

I can't encourate you enough to give this one a try.  It's got decent length, minimal annoyances, and no major bugs I could see.  Really a top of the line title and well worth the minimal price you'll pay to get it.",A Must Buy for PS2 Owners

B000HQBZOM,5.0,"This is the 1st Sega Genesis compilation to be released on the PS2 and other than a couple of certifiable duds that are included on here, if you are an old school gamer like myself or just love great games in general, this is a must buy.

I went back a few years back and bought a Genesis again as I've always sorely regretted it trading it and my SNES stuff in for the original Playstation when it came out.

But one of the games that just proved too much for me to buy was Phantasy Star IV.  This game went for 100 dollars brand new when it originally came out and you'll find copies of it going for upwards of 300 dollars on Ebay.

But the good folks at Sega saw fit to include this fantastic RPG on here along with the other Genesis Phantasy Star parts 2 & 3 on here as well.  What would have been extra cool was to have been able to unlock the original 8 bit Phantasy Star from the Sega Master System on here so that the entire original saga was represented.  Since Phantasy Star IV is the most direct sequel to the original game, it would've made sense and made a lot of the events/references in Part 4 hit home more.

Other than the other Phantasy Star games on here, you also get the 1st 2 Sonic games, the Genesis & Arcade versions of Altered Beast (RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE!), all 3 Golden Axe games (Parts 1 & 2 are great, 3 is terrible & was only released in Japan as a result), Kid Chameleon, Shadow Dancer, Shinobi 3, Vectorman 1 & 2, Ecco the Dolphin 1 & 2.......

The only games on here that I was never that fond of in the 1st place were Alex Kidd, Ristar, Virtua Fighter 2 (which was a horrible Genesis port of a great 3D fighter), Sword of Vermilion and Super Thunder Blade.  But they do have their fans.

One of the coolest aspects of this compilation other than unlocking great interview segments and hidden Arcade games by Sega is that they saw fit to give you the ability to save anywhere you want in a game.  You can then go back to playing it later right smack where you left off.  This is most helpful in the Phantasy Star games in which you can save right before a tough boss fight or in Kid Chameleon  which was a great game made infamous by the fact it didn't have  a password/save feature on it.  As a result, you had to play the entire game in one go which took about 6 to 7 hours.

A couple of small quibbles is that fact they included the arcade version of Altered Beast as an unlockable, why not the arcade version of Golden Axe and Super Thunder Blade?

All in all, this is a great collection of games. Volume 2 is rumored to include the Streets of Rage of trilogy which is too cool.

Fans of the 16 bit era of video games would do wise to pick this up.  Considering you get a perfect port of Phantasy Star 4 (and this compilation only costs 20 dollars), this is worth buying just for that fact alone.",Phantasy Star IV!!!!!
B000034DMG,5.0,"Resident Evil 2: Greatest Hits (2000). The re-release of the 1998 blockbuster sequel to Capcom's survival horror series.

 When the Playstation first started out, one of the first games to put the system on the map was Capcom's first foray into survival horror games, Resident Evil. Aside from the earlier series Alone In The Dark, Resident Evil was the first game of its kind to really bring the survival horror genre to life, complete with various puzzles and zombie blasting action. Since RE1 managed to build up a solid fanbase, Capcom was soon called to make a sequel the following year. Initially, they had 60% of the game completed and it was supposed to be released in early 97, but the creators weren't satisfied with the way it was going, saying that ""it needed a huge overhaul"". So the original plans were scrapped, forcing the fans to wait longer. But come early 1998, the wait was well worth it when Capcom unleashed the new and improved sequel, THE must-own PSX game of 98.

 RE2 was the first title in the series I played, and from the get-go, I was hooked. When I say that it's the best RE title to date, I'm not joking, as just about everything from the first game went through a MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT. I'm very glad that Capcom ditched their original plans so that a better sequel could be made. Now I'm not trying to turn this review into just gushing praise, but honestly there's so much to like about this game that beats out the original.

 For starters, the graphics are VASTLY superior to the first-generation visuals of the previous game. The character models are much more detailed, the still-screen environments are more vibrant (but dark and pale enough to convey the game's atmosphere), and the crappy B-movie quality intro of the original is gone in place of excellent CG movies. The characters and monsters, while still somewhat blocky, are all brought to life much better now with numerous animations, such as head tracking, and physical gestures during cutscenes. Also, when your character takes damage, you can now tell how hurt they are by the way they walk. If they hold onto their side and limp on one foot, you know that they're close to death. In addition, the newer game engine allows many more creatures to be in the area at one time, like when you stumble into a room with 7 zombies.

 Secondly, the sound is brought more into the front this time, with howls and screams of the monsters standing out more so than in the last game. It's especially noteworthy when something suddenly jumps through glass or breaks a wall. When this happens, you'll definitely jump out of your seat. As far as scares go, it'll certainly keep you on the edge until the end. Same thing with the musical score. Compared to the last game, the music is quite a bit more chilling and it seems to know just when something will come out after you. And most importantly, the voice acting is thankfully much better this time around. It's not perfect, but the dialogue and characters are very believable. For instance, Leon's character shows real determination, Claire is quite sympathetic yet assertive, and Chief Irons comes off as just plain creepy. These traits help distinguish the characters.

 The story is also brought out very well. Just a few months after the events in the first game, Raccoon City is overtaken by the T-Virus, and nearly every citizen has been turned into a zombie. Two outsiders, a rookie cop named Leon Kennedy, and Chris Redfield's (from the first game) younger sister Claire, wander into the monster infested city. The two get split up from one another only to end up in the police station. They soon find more characters and monsters to contend with, and discover the deep secrets of the Umbrella Corporation as the game goes on.

 The controls for the most part remain the same as in the first game, as do the menu options. You still have to backtrack often to ""item boxes"" to store items you can't hold in your limited inventory menu. This grows tedious, but oh well. I did find that the controls are a bit more responsive this time around. The characters have plenty of differentiation in gameplay, such as how Leon starts with the lighter, whereas Claire can open locks. Plus, both feature different weapon arsenals, so there are plenty of guns.

 Perhaps the best aspect of the game is the alternate scenario options introduced for the first time. What this means is that if you started and beat the game as Leon, you then play through the same story through Claire's perspective, and vice versa. The alternate scenario takes place in most of the same areas as the first time, but this time you have to contend with the menacing 7-foot, trenchcoat wearing Neo Tyrant. The idea is that he's constantly stalking you and could appear at any time (this idea was perfected with the Nemesis in RE3). The scenario features might make the game feel shorter than the original, but technically you'd be beating the game 4 times to see all the different endings. There's also a few cool mini games and sidequests to unlock, so you've got plenty of replayability here.

 About the only bad thing I can say about RE2 was the fact that the puzzles were a lot more simple and not very challenging compared to the others in the series. It's a minor flaw though and doesn't take much away from the game.

 Overall, RE2 is an excellent addition to the series, and expands the original game to new heights. Since it's available on multiple platforms now, it's very easy to come across.

B00VU4J13W,5.0,"so far, I had a chance to play an hour of campaign and the rest couple of hours I tried the Multi Player

Campaign : Decent story plot so far (watch out for the last scene on the first mission), very well designed characters and a brief intro about them. The game play is smooth, shows us around with the new movement controls. You can also create your own class for each of the mission that you enter. with the weapons that most suit you, more like a pre lobby.
Pretty much like a test to feel the movement of the game and the controls.

Multi player : this is what Call of duty is all about, and they have not failed us this time. The lobby's were empty as I got an early copy (couple of hours).Could only play couple of decent games. Should look out to see if my game play is on any YouTube videos, coz there were few famous you tubers in there.
The game play is smooth. The abilities like wall run and under water abilities where beautifully designed. The transition from on foot combat to these abilities where very smooth.
Pros:
The footsteps were more louder and clearer to spot the enemies, unlike in AW.
I didn't have to empty a whole mag to take down an enemy, Couple of good shots were good enough.
No annoying exo jumps, which means snipers can have a big role in all the games.
Bo3 lets player choose different class of players with unique abilities. This is a bonus I would say to the already added movement system.
Cons:
(Will update, if found any)

This game would definitely bring back a lot of players from old gen consoles, which AW couldn't
If you are into multi player, then this is the game for you, else watch a few campaign game plays on YouTube and decide (I am not sure how long the campaign is).

The original Dark Souls was my favorite have I've played over the years in my life. the feel to it was great and it was a unique game. now that Dark Souls II was about to come out. I couldn't let my self to let the chance of playing the sequel of my favorite game go away. I preordred it on Sept. 2013. I was so excited for the game itself And I couldn't wait. I got the game today morning. And I played it for few hours and here is what do I have to say

- The game itself has a very different start from its prequel. although similar in the general goal of the game. I don't have a review for the story. because it would be considered a spoiler.

Gameplay.
- Gameplay is very smooth. very much enhanced from the original. if you think this would be easier than Dark Souls. I will disappoint you. It is not. as far as I've gotten now. this is harder than the Original. but they don't basically throw you into the fire just like they did in the original. there is a long prologue that will make you sure you get the game and its controls. but after that. playtime is over. the real Dark Souls starts. it will be very challenging. and Yes. you will die. A lot of times. am used to that personally. I've died probably around 1000 times in the first.

- Graphics and frame rate

we all know that the original Dark Souls had some really good graphics. but also. its known for frame rate drops. really steep drops. especially in Blighttown and such places. but so far in the game. I haven't had any major frame rate drops. nothing that I noticed. The graphics are surprisingly better. way better. I liked how they had really nice contrast to them. texture quality is awesome. world details are great and I couldn't ask for more.

- Controls and in-game items

Controls are same as the original for the most part. the only difference I noticed is that you use L3 to perform a running-jump instead of using the Circle Button. I really didn't have trouble with that. but the L3 button is hard to click while the Circle button is the button your already holding to spring. so its a better option. In game items are for the most part same as the originals. Alluring Skull. Cracked red eye orb. and of course Estus flask. and many others are present in this one as well. so. playing Dark Souls before this is a huge advantage. please note that moving the stick is more sensitive in DSII. the character will easily move quickly. causes me to fall a lot.

- Character and game GUI
the way you build your character is same as the original DS for the most part. so I don't need to talk to you about it. however. There are 8 character classes in the game. Warrior, Knight, Swordsman, Bandit, Cleric, Sorcerer, Explorer, Deprived. you obviously notice that the Pyromancer class is missing. which is the only thing I am pissed about. Pyromancer class was the best for a start-up. and It was pretty unique and it fits the game very well. I hope they add that to the game later. but since that is too hard to do as the game is already finished. I doubt we're gonna see that happening. but there are still Pyromancies. which anybody can use them if you have the required item. which is the pyromancy hand. game GUI is significantly better than the original. very clean layout and easy to read text font. nice menu and generally the GUI itself is a nice upgrade .

What I liked about it.

- I liked how DSII is very similar to DS. many games screw up games but going off the topic and the layout of the original. but From Software has done it right. they stick to what people like. made the necessary upgrades and enhancements. but they didn't force any major changes as we usually see in video game sequels. for me. that's always a good thing.

Enjoy the game. And I would get it right now. not in few years while multiplayer is pretty much dead. (even tho Dark Souls multiplayer is still very active). this one needs to be played early. and of course. Praise the Sun!

***UPDATE***
-You can change the running-jump control back to the Circle button from the game options. that's a good thing. And once again. I assure you that this game is harder than the original Dark Souls!. I have a weapon pack and it is still harder.

****TIPS****
- as a DS player. I would like to give you few tips on this game
*First and most importantly. Scan your environment. there are alot of hidden items and walkways that you might miss for hours, days if you don't look. (I just missed the walkway to a place in DSII. went somewhere else that I shouldn't be at at my level. took me hours and I couldn't beat the hard enemies over there. Wondered why. apparently. I should be somewhere else).

*Don't rush it. if you rush through Dark Souls II. you will not last few minutes in your run. eventually. you will either, Fall over a ledge. Get backstabbed from behind. or quite simply run into a herd of just too many enemies and get surrounded by them. do the game slowly.

*Don't use flasks or any health healers during a close fight it DSII. in DS. if you get hit while drinking an estus flask. you get reduced damage. but in DSII. you get full damage anyways. so it makes it a waste of estus. get to a safe sport and stock on health.

*Upgrade the crucial skills first. . I would personally upgrade my Dexterity and Vitality. Don't upgrade the intel or faith. do that later. (In DS. vitality increases Health, In DSII. it increases stamina.)

I will add other tips when I get more experience in DSII. for now. this should be helpful if you don't already think about doing this. mostly logic.

****Have something to say****
when I say that this game is harder than Dark Souls. I mean its way way harder. imagine that Dark Souls is an easy mode of the game. and DSII is the hardest mode of the game. that might be even less of how hard the game is. its just unbelievable difficult. side stepping is useless. enemies will still lock on you and hit you. even if you side step while running. the AI is really high. it takes about 2 hits to die in the game. Just run past through enemies to find a bonfire. I did that few times. you only have 1 estus flask when you start. 2 when you upgrade for the first time(which you will be able to early). if you had trouble with DS and you hated it and you don't want to get stuck a lot. this is not for you. this game is extremely difficult. even harder than Demon's Souls. Personally. on DS. I've played 3 playthroughs. killed Smough and Ornstein by myself on all of these playthroughs. on the last one I did it on the first try. am not the best or even close to but I consider myself good. this is beyond you can imagine hard until you actually play it. don't invoke an enemy that you see if you don't have to fight him. just run through them. find a bonfire. and then go back and kill them. its nearly impossible to get to different places with killing all the enemies. your fancy footwork won't work here. the AI is high. very small chance it does. I have a weapon pack. which has a good shield and a good weapon. about 3 times better than the startup one. and am getting my but whopped basically. they basically through you into the lava. not the fire. this time

****GLITCHES NOTICED****
-Sound glitch noticed. you see picture before sound sometimes in this game. sometimes NPC's don't even speak even tho you see the subtitles.

-The first boss. the last giant. is glitched. he has two attacks where range is not what you think it is. there is one attack where he would just try to crush you by falling on the ground. I was fifteen ft away behind him. AND I DIED. twice. the other attack is after he loses 50% of his health when he uses his other arm as a weapon. I was also behind him. he slammed the sword to his front. while I was behind him. and I died. I don't get that. they need to fix some things.

*****UPDATE***
So far. am kind of disappointed at few things'
- so far. been through 7 areas. nothing large like Darkroot garden,Basin. ash lake. in DS2. its very compact and it feels like playing a generic RPG in terms of the world. that disappointed me a lot.
- the game kind of lost its Dark Souls-ness feel. the game is harder than DS. but it is so different in terms of enemies. mechanics and how the game goes about the story. very different. you will notice that

*****UPDATE. MULTIPLAYER and some other issues*******
- I was able to reach areas where I can be invaded. and so far its a huge disappointment. Lag is unbearable. I slash the enemy with my sword. he was around for 10 seconds before he actually get staggered and lose damage. surprised because it should reduce lag due to the dedicated servers. horrible so far. needs a quick fix.
- My second issue with MP is that. Invasions are so random. you can get invaded while hollow or human. and unlike dark souls. you see the ""You Got invaded"" message AFTER the enemy is in the map. few times i got surprised to see the enemy right next to me without a message. also. I've never seen a summon sign so far. Even in the 2011 Dark Souls. I still see people putting summon signs.
- People have weapons that I don't even have. I killed 9 Bosses. And I only have about 10 unique weapons. and others have the weirdest weapons that don't exist so far in the game.
- Hacking: yes. here we go again. game has some hackers. some naked guy running around and yet he receives less damage than me with a heavy armor with 700+ protection.
- Another issue is that so far. I don't have any really good weapons or anything. In Dark Souls. you could obtain some really cool weapons early in the game. but so far. it doesn't seems like it in DS2.
- Titanite anything. is freaking rare. as I said. am 9 bosses down. and Yet. I've never found anything but a titanite shard, large titanite shard. and both of these are very rare and limited.
- Not as many merchants at all. only 3 merchants that have limited supply. and sell you the worst weapons and armors, items. in the game.
- One positive thing I've noticed is that its harder to get a backstab. yes. believe it or not ladies and gentlemen. it is harder to get a backstab.
- Again. one thing I didn't like so far is the lack of Mini-bosses. remember how many times you died against Havel the Rock in DS?. there aren't many Mini-bosses or really strong enemies so far. I will update more if that changes.
I might need to reconsider my 5 star review. but I will do that when Am done with my first playthough.

********UPDATE******
- Even though a couple of areas in the beginning of the game weren't the best. there are really nice areas that are awesome. reminds me of DS. challenging areas with really strong enemies. falling of the ledge and all that is here. great. I was pissed off about some things. but this game keeps getting better and better. ****they released a second patch to fix PvP and summoning because it wasn't working****

******UPDATE******
- The world in this game has such great elements. there are some enemies and bosses that will make you wonder how great the designer was. few enemies are the best fighting and gamelooking ever. really great game design. level design. especially at about halfway to the end of the game. really great what DSII is bringing to the table.

When I say that this game is brutally hard. I don't mean it in a bad way. no. the reason why mos of dark-a-holics play this game because it challenges you. that what this game does. no easy mode. no easy way out. this game will be painful in terms of how hard it is to beat. just like any souls game.

******UPDATE.MP*********
- as OP as magic was in the original DS. it is even more OP here. MP is basically ruled by hexes(which are Dark Magic. they're called a different name here). and regular magic. many of them just kill you in 1 hit. fast attacks. and too much speed and hard to avoid. I am personally terrible at MultiPlayer against magic or any of its categories. i usually win in physical fights. but other than that. magic is unbeatable for me. if you want to be good at MP. your only option is a magic/hex build. just too strong and am dissappointed. Pyro is as weak as it was in the original dark souls. miracles aren't really intended for PVP. so they're weak anyways. and thats it. Rolling is being made an essential part of this game. shielding with a good shield isn't enough. they made it even worse for me. i like dark souls because it has heavy equipment. but they're (once again). giving advantage to magic users and light armor runners.

******Finished first Playthrough*********
Played the whole game. and This game is really really good. I liked it tons. but this makes me think. is this better than the Original Dark Souls?. thats a good question. I will play more playthroughs. and we will see. so far. am really disappointed at how unfair and unbalanced multiplayer is. as i said. magic rules in MP (if you played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls. you probably already know that. its becoming a ""Souls"" game trend. OP magic). trust me. it is. the only way you think that magic is not OP. many say that its not because they're themselves magic users. and they basically don't want to say that they're good players because of the magic. for PvE. I'd have to say that Dark Souls is better. but not by much. Dark Souls II is still awesome. worth playing right now. but I liked the original DS. my personal opinion. I liked some elements in DS II over DS. weapons are way better in Dark Souls II. there are less weapons (I Believe). but the variety of move sets are way more. some of them are awful. halberds and spears have some really weird move sets that make no sense. Best thing about DS II. the Bosses. there are ** of them. few of them you don't need to kill at all. but they give you something. let me put it in this way. unique.

B005764CWO,5.0,"So I am going to do this review a little different than others. First, I know these remotes are not sold in store (or at least where I live) so not many people know about them and it might mislead people. You see After-Glow remotes and they last about 6 months if that. These remotes, however, do not break. I did my ""drop-test"" on it. Its basically where I drop it from 6 feet on hard tile repeatedly (about 20 times). If i did the same thing with other remotes, it wouldn't be pretty. It scratched, but did not break. I love the fact that it has got dualshock and has blue neons in it that you can turn on and off. The light is not extremely bright, unlike After-glow making it good for playing in the dark because it won't blind you. It also has a what I could on describe as an air conditioner for your hands. Now I also love the price, They are about ten dollars cheaper than After-Glow and on a much higher quality. Now for the only con I could find. It is not for hard-core gamers. I am personally, and I have found at times that the remote is not as responsive as high-end remotes. When playing a racing game you would have to react quicker than most players to avoid the same obstacle. Overall, I say this remote is the only way to go, and if you are a casual gamer, then there is no reason not to buy it.","The most ""bang"" for the buck."

B000F5IH2I,5.0,"I really enjoy playing FF XII. I've been playing FF XII for 8 months now. I'm still leveling up 6 of my game characters. All of which are level 79 at the moment, but I need level 99. Level 99 is not a must for the last boss battle, but I'm going for a perfect game. I know for one of the last monster side quest, that at level 99 that mob can take a few hours to defeat, at level 99. At lower levels it takes a lot longer. There are many monster side quest, and all a quest to get all the Espers.

I haven't even finished the small fishing quest yet. I can ride chickens but not for too long, maybe for a few minutes.

I really enjoy playing this game and the story line, is really very long. I love the graphic's for the ps 2. This game in my opinion really shines. The game play is long, well for me it is.

I don't mind the gambit system. I can set the gambit to do all the work for me, or turn the gambits off, if I want to do all the work, while fighting.

This game does require leveling up, if you want to defeat certain bosses. However, there are plenty of open space and monsters to help level up. I could not make food, but I can trade in items off monsters for bazzar items.

But if you keep playing it, if you're not a FPS lover you'll soon be tired of this game. The awesome weapons and unique arena drags anyone who likes fighting games. But the game play might be boring. Usally you do in this game is like this:
 You run around the arena, pick up weapons, and run around some more, crash into a enemy, fire  weapons, totally blow them up, then you get blown up by other players and AI's and repeat this things for half an hour. This is what made me stopping playing this game. So this game is like 1~2 stars to people who's not very good at FPS. BUT if your game genre is really a FPS game least try the demo version.

B00005NZ1G,5.0,"Clearly I'm not the first to jump on the bandwagon, but it IS true - ""Halo"" is a fantastic game, and is easily the best first-person shooter on ANY console system. For that matter, it's one of the best games on a console system, period, and is the current absolute must-own for Xboxers. Point of fact, it's nearly worth getting an Xbox for this game alone.
The single-player campaign warrants the price tag all by itself thanks to its blistering action, wonderful scripting, and interesting storyline (which features a splendid twist that alters the entire tone of the game). But what truly gives ""Halo"" such a long shelf life is its multiplay. If there's a better way to lose track of time than multiplayer ""Halo,"" I certainly don't know of one. Killing your friends (or getting killed by your friends) is fantastic fun, and, what's more, you can tweak the gameplay options to your heart's content. To add some icing to this already delicious cake, you can go through the entire single-player campaign with a friend alongside. This cooperative mode is something more games should offer.
Despite what you may have heard, ""Halo"" is not perfect, though. The campaign likes to recycle its settings, and sometimes makes you feel as if you're just going in circles (even though you're not).  The level design certainly could have used some work, and should be given extra attention in the upcoming sequel.

B0007PLKZM,5.0,"I know this game has been out for awhile, but I had a PS2 for a few months recently since I was poor and kind of sheltered growing up from the world of console gaming...and I figured I'd come on here and review a few games from that experience. In all the games I purchased for the system, this one was by far my favorite. I'd like to state for the record, however, that I am NOT a GTA fan. I now have a PS3 and GTA 4 is the only one of the series that I could actually play without getting pissed off at the poor combat controls and incessant run-ins with the police. I would have enjoyed those games if not for those two major aspects, which is why games like Scarface: The World is Yours and The Godfather became so much more appealing to me.

The story of this game takes place during the final moments of the movie...right before Tony Montana gets shot and killed by Sosa's leading assassin. This game is an alternate reality of sorts, where you know what happens so that you can prevent the death from occurring. In the process you escape your mansion and lay low for a couple years before reemerging to once again build your empire. To do so you must sell drugs, buy fronts around Miami, and ultimately take out Sosa and his allies. Being such a big fan of the motion picture, this game is an absolute dream.

Playing through this I found myself doing side missions much more often than the main storyline. Of course, you almost have to in order to increase your overall health and build up your reputation. That aside, my point is that this is what GTA should be like! I don't feel compelled to run around doing missions for people aimlessly in this game. I actually have a goal. And believe me, once you get to the end and everything is said and done, you'll feel a great sense of accomplishment.

My only complaint about this game is that the combat can sometimes be very unforgiving. You can attempt to destroy a gang's hangout area only to find yourself killed in one lucky shot at times. That or the cops will be on you before you've killed everyone and then you've got to high-tail it out of there if you want to escape with your balls intact (no pun intended). The cops on this game are much more forgiving than GTA, in my opinion, especially since you can pay off your heat so the cops won't be on your ass constantly. The only other thing I found out with this game, and it is minor, is that traveling by boat can be a pain. It's not impossible to get around enemies and/or kill them while out at sea, I just think it could have been designed a little bit better.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the movie, was turned off by GTA's shortcomings, or just wants to hear more F-bombs dropped than in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Believe me though...the dialogue is great, the graphics are a hell of a lot better than GTA games (with the exception of the ones on next gen consoles), and the gameplay is the best I've seen in any GTA clone. If you have a PS2 and don't have this game, then shame on you. If you have a PS3 and haven't played this, once things are backwards compatible with the PS2 you better try this game out. Realize the American Dream and get this game now!","Get this game and you'll get what's coming to you: the world, chico, and everything in it!"

B00HQNYMQ2,5.0,"Being only 19 years old, I have not been around long enough to be able to participate in the nostalgia that this game could bring to older gamers. I have never played the older Wolfenstein games, so they will not bias my opinion of this game. Let's jump to it!

If you have read any of my other reviews, you can probably tell that I'm not hard to please when it comes to games. Sure I have some standards, but for the most part I'll give everything a chance and not completely rule anything out until I've played it. This game does not disappoint by any means.

Story: I'm sure you are all familiar with the story at this point, so I'll just give my take on it. It was actually a really engrossing story, and I really enjoyed it. I kept wanting to play the game because I wanted to know what happened next. It had all of the parts that make a good story: action, romance, tough choices, emotion, and best of all, killing nazis. The voice acting was great, and it had great pacing. I completed it in 12.4 hours on the middle difficulty, and I'm going to play through again on the hardest to see how the story is different. There is one point towards the beginning where you have to make a choice, and depending on the choice it will affect your game, so I'm going to play through again on the alternate storyline to see how it differs.

Gameplay: Plays like a first person shooter, pretty standard. One thing that I don't like is that most games (to me at least) are easier to play on PC, but this one was a bit more difficult. Running and sliding isn't a major part to this game, but it is required to level up some perks (which I'll explain later), and it's really hard to hold shift to run, W to move forward, and C to slide, all at the same time. I imagine that had I used a controller it would have been easier, so take that into account. I also saw a lot of people complaining that you had to manually pick up ammo, and maybe because it's because I just came from playing Metro 2033 (where you also have to manually pick up ammo), but I say so what? Everyone complains that they want more realistic games, so this one makes it a bit more realistic by having you manually pick up ammunition, and everyone complains at that! There is no pleasing gamers! Lolol.

One other quick thing that I also liked was their health system. Your maximum health limit is 100, so if you find a health pack that would put you over that 100, say to 150, your health would go up to 150 on what they called ""overcharge"", and then slowly deteriorate back down to 100. So you can still pick up health packs that you find along your way, but you can't get completely overpowered and get like 500 health. Your health would only regenerate to the nearest 20 I think, so if you lost health to 54, it would go back up to 60. If you hit 17, it would go back up to 20. (I don't know if it's the nearest 10 or 20, I didn't pay attention that much hahaha.) I also really liked that you really could take either level as stealth, or all out guns blazing. The stealth system was really well done.

I keep remembering gameplay aspects I need to add xD Another big complain I heard was about the enemy AI, and how they were basically really dumb. I had probably 2 or 3 spots throughout the entire game where I encountered them acting really weirdly, but for the most part they functioned as they should, taking cover, shooting, trying to flank me, etc.

Sound: As I stated before, voice acting was great. I really enjoyed the music in this game, you got into some pretty cool fights and when you did it would start blasting some heavy metal in the background to get you pumped up. I'm not an expert on how guns are supposed to sound, but all of the gun sounds were great. One thing about the voicing that really really really pleased me was that when you went up against most of the enemies, they spoke german. Not a british accent, not english with a german accent, but full on, fluent german. I loved that, because it really helped immerse you in the game. One thing that I actually thought was really funny was that with the subtitles in the game, you can set them to on, off, or just when someone is speaking a foreign language (which is what I had it set to). There's this guy in the beginning that's on your team that speaks English with a Scottish accent. He is in no way not understandable, I could understand him fine, but it still put up subtitles for when he talked. I just thought it was funny that it put up subtitles, even though he was speaking english xD

Level up system: The perks system in this game is quite different than most games, but I actually really enjoyed it. There are 4 skill trees, and instead of having to level up Perk A to get to Perk B, and then Perk B to get to Perk C, each perk had a requirement that you had to complete to unlock it. To get so many kills with a certain weapon, or get a certain amount of stealth takedowns. That way you could work on whatever skill tree you wanted, and whatever perks you wanted to unlock. (If that doesn't make sense, let me know in the comments and I can try and clear it up a little bit hahaha.)

Graphics: There was one thing that really bothered me about the graphics. They look great, from far away. But as soon as you get up close to the walls, just as an example, you could see how awful the textures looked. They were 2D, grainy, and just plain gross. I know it's just nitpicking, but hey, that's what reviews are for lol. The game also had cinematic prerendered cutscenes, which only ran in 30 fps, but looked better than the ingame. I don't imagine this game is too terribly taxing, I have a 770 and could max the game out, AA and all. There were some framerate stutters occasionally, but for the most part is was a fluid 60 fps.

Dislikes: I had very few dislikes about the game, but one of my big ones I thought was kind of a stretch with the main character. Not giving away any plotpoints, but there was a point where you get stabbed in the stomach, and then after you take the guy down you basically get up and act like it's no big deal, and at one point help boost a guy up to like a ledge. It's like really? If you really got shanked through the stomach with a bowie knife you wouldn't be doing that. One other thing that I didn't care for was the main character. I didn't hate him by any means, but to me he didn't have any believability, or emotion. He was actually really great, until about a fourth of the way through a game, and after that he just kind of clammed up and didn't have any personality. Maybe he's supposed to be that way, I don't know, but it was something I didn't care for.

Overall, I was extremely pleased with this game. I had heard great things about it, and I was not disappointed. I got it for $30 on a steam sale, and would have easily paid up to $45 for it. It has a ton of replayability, an awesome story, decent graphics, awesome soundtrack, and as stated previously, best of all? You get to blow apart nazis. :D",Wolfenstein: A refreshing take on the FPS

B0001ZZNNI,5.0,"For the gamer from New York, how could you say this is a super disappointment? It does not have the ability to save, and the original never did either. Nintendo did not add anything and it is ""bare bones"" becuase it is an exact copy of the original cart---hence the title ""Classic NES Series"".If they added more to it, it wouldn't exactly be the classic game in its original form now would it? So thanks for giving this game a low rating because you needed something to gripe about. This was the first game I ever played in my life and it is every bit as good on here.
As far as Nintendo's place in the handheld gaming industry, there is no one better. The gameboy advance has so many great games. I would definately say they are headed in the right direction in that area. And if you don't think so, check out the Nintendo DS this fall.

B000ZJVDA2,5.0,"Lost Odyssey is an amazing game, and a throwback to traditional JRPGs in the vein of Final Fantasy. The game's characterizations are fantastic, and its premise lends itself well as a new take on the amnesiac hero. The story of Lost Odyssey is deeply affecting; it is both full of action and laced with soft, tender moments. These moments come from the interactions of characters with one another, as well as when certain events unlock memories told through poetic short stories that are accompanied by music and dreamscape-like pictures. The action comes from random encounters and boss fights, which require strategy, forethought, and skill. All of these elements meld together really well, and create a wondrous story-driven adventure. As long as you don't come in expecting a rpg like Mass Effect or Fallout 3 (both great, of course : ), and are prepared for an often slow, but always rewarding tale,you will most likely enjoy this game.","A beautiful, affecting addition to this generation's rpg library"

Everything about this one is an improvement - the gameplay (fighting a mob of thugs, for example), maneuvering through Gotham City (either by Fast Travel by Batwing or by grapnel accelerator), and the cinematic scenes are just as good as any Batman movie, IMO.

B009AGXH64,5.0,"The Wii U is a must have system for Nintendo fans.  Yes, it's not perfect, but no system is. Between the amazing Gamepad, updated graphics, and the novel game mechanics made possible by the screen on the Gamepad, I have been having a blast ever since I got this system.

The initial download/update did take a few hours with my DSL internet (the cheapest DSL available by the way).  Once I got past this initial hurdle, the fun took off with no end in sight!  I love the controller, graphics, games, etc.  Any Nintendo fan should get this console.  The Gamepad is more revolutionary than the Wii Remote in many ways.  The opportunity for asymmetrical gameplay in local multiplayer is a huge advantage that Nintendoland, ZombiU, and New Super Mario Bros. U take full advantage of.  And being able to use the Wii Remote controllers that you already own from the original Wii is a great money saver.  We'll have to wait and see how successful the Wii U turns out to be, but based on my experiences it should be a smash hit.",Amazing System
B003HFFSIE,5.0,"I've spent more game time on Oblivion than any other game I've owned.  I've played the game on the PC platform as well as on this XBox360 platform.  Between the two, in terms of being able to lose oneself in the gaming experience, my preference is XBox360.  If you value being able to use cheats or mods then you'll want to give this a pass and go to the PC version.

Oblivion feature open game play, meaning you can, with few exceptions, choose the order in which you complete missions throughout the game.  There is a primary game mission to follow which is probably a good choice when you first start, until you get used to the rest of the game and then you'll probably find you quickly develop some favorite missions and quests which you'll choose to follow before you return to the main method.

Interesting as well is the leveling system which progressively increases the challenges (and the rewards) of missions as well as the available loot and items you can obtain throughout the game.  If you wish the options available to finish all the missions and explore all the available caves, mines, forts, etc. can easily lead to up to 200 hours of game play.

Add to this graphics that all immaculate, scrolling that leaves you feeling like you're in the midst of an animated movie which you're directing and you have all the ingredients for a classic gaming experience.

All that's missing is a multi-player option, which, when you think about it, is probably more the result of the use of the available resources to make the stand-alone option as good as it is.

When you're finished with your character, you're not finished.  You'll find it an easy thing to return to the game and change your character and characteristics and then go through the game as a thief, a warrior, a mage and despite the familiar missions the challenge morphs enough in it's new approach that you'll not mind that and will want to play the game again.

Be aware that there are add-ons available through XBox that you will want to look at, in particular the Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine.  The cost of adding these on are high enough (despite the time that has passed) that you'd be wise to buy an edition with those additions on, as you'll save money.

All in all, it's hard to imagine a much better RPG.  If you like the genre at all you'll have to have this game.  If you're not necessarily and enthusiast, this game may just make you one.

5 stars.

Theres still the platformer you love, but a sandbox game as your hub like gta. The graphics are mostly the same but tweaked to look sleeker which is up for opinion. Controls don't get more complicated even with more buttons. The story is darker and powers are too an epic story that really follows well from the promise of one in the first. The same characters are all there with plenty of new ones. Lots of missions, and side missions the lvls range from the usual caves and lush landscapes to industrial and ancient ruins. Enemies range from soldiers, creatures, and monsters but with all the upgrades and new dark jak powers there just fun to kill.  Not the most secrets but lots of rewards such as cheats, changing jaks features and fun tweaks to the game. Theres racing but whats better is just ""jak""ing cars and driving around but i find the hoverboard best, yes, hoverboard. U get guns instead of eco, but still cool to play with and there are many mini games.

B002NN7AKU,5.0,"The Good: Two revolutionary games for a low price, remastered for HD, super epic, amazing combat, story, visuals, lots of extra content

The Bad: Feels a bit dated, the first game has some minor issues

What happens when you put two of the best action adventure games created on one disc? Ultimate satisfaction. Both God of Wars have been updated in widescreen format with slightly polished visuals for HD display and running at a lightning fast 60 FPS. If you bought the game new you will have received a code to download the God of War III demo, but as of now this code is useless since the demo is now on PSN and the game is due out in just over a week. Other than that nothing else has been changed for the PS3 except trophies which was the main drive for me to purchase these games all over again. So here is a separate review for each game.

God of War

Being released in 2004 the does feel a bit old. There are more flaws in this game than the first, but let's start with the good things. Apart from revolutionizing games and the action adventure genre single-handedly the game is amazing and epic. The game is full of huge towering bosses, waves and waves of enemies, a deep dark story full of Greek mythology, a fluid, almost perfect combat system, and boobs. Yes that's right boobs. At the time of release I had never seen a game with so much nudity before, but it shouldn't really shock gamers as much these days. The game also has some very intricate puzzles that wind up being whole levels that you have to solve such as Pandora's Temple. The combat system is pretty fast and fluid on its own.

With Kratos whipping his Blades of Chaos around you feel like you have complete control over him. Another combat element that revolutionized games was quick time events. After weakening an enemy enough you pressed the corresponding button (usually circle) over them and a series of buttons flash on-screen. If you don't press it on time the enemy knocks you down and you have to start over. Of course you can just kill them normally if this gets dull for you. The best QTEs, however, are during boss fights. If just feels awesome to plow a mast through a 200 foot tall Hydra. Now you do need to realize that there is magic here as well. You get four different powers throughout the game such as Medusa's Gaze (freeze enemies), Poseidon's Rage (shock), Hade's Army (souls that continuously attack enemies). These, plus your weapons, can be upgraded by collecting red experience orbs. As you upgrade all your items you get new moves, plus increased power. If you're asking about your health and magic your can collect Phoenix Feathers and Gorgon eyes for magic and health respectively. These are all found in hidden chests throughout the game so keep an eye out.

The camera is fixed so it frees up the right analog stick for dodging moves, the camera does a perfect job of following the action without any problems. Some times you can scale up walls and even fight there or on ropes. Combat is pretty much anywhere Kratos goes and this keeps things mixed up. The level's traps and puzzles are very well designed and require you to really think or be on your toes.

The story is very deep and memorable. We see Kratos as a fallen Spartan leader who gives his life to Ares if he slays he Barbarian leader who is about to behead him. Ares makes Kratos his servant for eternity, but Kratos becomes a raging killer who kills the wrong people. He becomes set on a path to free the nightmares from his mind and kill Ares in the process.

If I were to nitpick about what's bad about the game it's that the game looks kind of dated from today. The textures are a bit low-res and blurry, and there are some collision detection problems when jumping around. The game is also extremely difficult even on the normal setting so God mode becomes virtually impossible. The game has a decent length of about 8-10 hours, but other than that the game is great for the first outing. If you finish up the game you get to unlock hidden costumes, Challenge of the Gods, and some other hidden treasures.

God of War II

If you think the first game was epic wait until now. With visuals that surpass the first game twofold, and even more huge epic bosses God of War II became the best game to ever grace the PS2. The story follows just after the events of God of War. Kratos is still sent on a war path to avenge his nightmares and kill Zeus for killing and betraying him. He must find the Sisters of Fate and turn back time to the moment Zeus betrayed him and kill him.

The combat system is slightly upgraded, but pretty much the same. It feels a bit more fluid, and we even get some more moves. The controls are a bit more refined, and we get new powers. We get some new secondary weapons such as a hammer and staff that can be upgraded. The puzzles aren't as hard as the first game, but there are a lot more of them this time around. The game also seems to be a bit harder as well with even tougher enemies. We get a new grapple hook for swinging around so this adds a lot to the game play. The game also feels more fluid and has a lot more epic moments than the first game, but most of these come towards the end of the game.

While God of War II pretty much is almost like the first all the new content make it an epic and thrilling sequel. The only issues with the game is that it looks a bit dated, the game can be very tough at times as well. The game is about the same length as the first, but the game obviously feels and plays five times better than the first game. There are a great amount of extras as well as a full length making of section on the disc for God of War II.

So if you think all this sounds good you can now pick the game up brand new for $30. $15 a piece for two of the best games ever made is a great bargain to me. With a separate set of trophies for each game, HD resolution, and faster FPS this is a huge package that is exploding with awesomeness. God of War Collection is probably one of the best deals to grace consoles since The Orange Box so don't hesitate; every PS3 owner has to have this collection or you aren't a true gamer.",Two of the best PS2 games in one updated package

B0002XL3BA,5.0,"It is definitely not a game for kids because of the nudity. The storyline is pretty cool and it kind of feels like your in Ancient Greece. It's about an ex-Spartan soldier who seeks vengeance against the god of war---Ares. The storyline is not that long. It would take about 3days to a week playing for 3 hours a day. Lots of good extras, 4 difficulty levels(one is bonus), funny easter eggs. Fighting medusas, satyrs, and meeting some of the gods. There is a couple of hard parts but I got past them.

B0000AFWWH,5.0,"These install and play fine on my Windows Vista 32bit machine. There is absolutely no tweaking involved and they run just like any current game does.

I bought it especially for Riven, since I already own RealMyst and Exile (although I only have the 4 CD version of the latter, so the much more convenient DVD version found in this compilation is going to replace it).

The Riven movies play fine with QuickTime Alternative 1.81. Make sure you install that specific version first, and then install the latest one (the authors removed Directshow playback after v1.81 due to licensing issues).

Otherwise you can always use the outdated Quicktime 6.3 which is included on the disc.

B006JSY3MI,5.0,"While the gameplay is pretty simple (you already expected that, didn't you?), the game content is brilliant. Actually if the turn-based gameplay were any more complex it would distract from the reason I got the game in the first place - the story. The game truly does play like a long South Park episode, with the story getting progressively more and more ridiculous - but in the same way fans of the show have grown to love.

At the same time, the game does make use of the interactive nature of the medium well - inserting easter eggs, crafting creative, explorable environments, poking fun at the fetch quest trope, lightly mocking the Skyrim franchise, including 80's video game references, including a ""simon says"" casual game element at one point with a few sequences that you can't possibly win and aren't intended to resulting in hilarious consequences, and the list goes on. An absolutely wonderful way to waste approximately 20 hours of time for fans of the series.",A brilliant franchise extension

B00BT2BFKW,5.0,"Something about the Disney Infinity game really draws my wife into it; while it's not the type of game I usually play, I enjoy it as well. The downside: most of the characters don't come with full worlds of their own, but can only be used in the toybox, so if you want to do adventure mode you need one of a limited number of playsets.

Although this playset is Lone Ranger themed, it could just as well have been called ""generic western""; after a few hours of play we haven't seen anything that's really specific to the Lone Ranger. You spend a lot of time riding around shooting bad guys, and also a fair amount of time getting things (and people) where they need to go.

So far, this playset and Pirates are our most-played worlds. Lone Ranger has a nifty ricochet ability that makes it easy for him to hit things even if you're a lousy shot - unfortunately, they're not always the things you want to hit! This is also the only playset where you can unlock the vault with only two characters. It's a worth addition to your Disney Infinity collection, especially if you catch one of the frequent sales; we definitely feel like we've gotten our money's worth.","Maybe not a must-have, but close"

B000WSE2WM,5.0,"With so many serious combat games out there, sometimes it's fun to kick back and have a little fun. That's Battlefield Bad Company. This isn't the elite squad, or the ultimate soldier, or the secret weapon. Instead, you're with the ""B Company"" of misfits. And you're not out to save the world from impending annihilation. Instead, you're just trying to do what you can to get through the battle with a bit of loot to make your retirement a nice one.

It's funny how the game turns many classic war cliches upside-down. This is definitely irreverent. And still, you have a lot of fun with it, getting to know the characters and their personalities. I can laugh out loud at the dialogue even multiple times through.

The gameplay is fun. There are extensive maps full of items to collect and gather up, and of course enemies to slaughter. You can destroy pretty much anything you want to, and enemies don't constantly regenerate out of some mysterious human-generator just behind the corner. It gives you a sense that this universe you're plowing through is reasonable.

There is a multiplayer mode but we don't tend to be multplayer people. I've heard from others that they love the multiplayer mode. I can report that the single player action is enormously fun and even on replays it still brings a smile.

Are there any down sides here? The game's about shooting and exploding people. It's not meant for little kids. If you're not a fan of combat, this probably isn't the game for you. But we absolutely adore this game. I love the humor, the gameplay, and the landscapes.

Highly recommended.

B00000J2W7,5.0,"The N64 had its share of ups and downs, but when it hit up, boy does it hit it. This is the ultimate party game. Invite some friends over, order a pizza, and watch the mayhem unfold. The controls and graphics have aged well, with the colors remaining bright and colorful and the moves still being easy to pull off.

The one downside is that the single player mode hasn't aged as well. Unlocking the four hidden characters is pretty simplistic, though it's hard to fault a 14ish year old game for that. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who wants to start up their collection of N64 games or for anyone looking for a great party experience","If you own a Nintendo 64, then you should own this game"
B000090W86,5.0,"The title of my review might sound confusing to those not quite familiar to the GBA Adapter for the Gamecube.  But here it is plain and simple.  Play your GBA games on the BIG Screen in 16/32 bit glory!  This is like playing your old Super Nintendo, but on the gamecube...sounds like a step backwards?  NO WAY!  As any fan of the Gameboy Advance knows, there are a BUNCH of fantastic unique titles to that system.  However the problem for someone like me is I really don't like playing these games on handhelds.  I prefer sitting in front of my 52"" TV holding a controller.  The GBA adapter makes this possible.  The picture quality is fantastic, it looks like your playing your super Nintendo (as the Gameboy Advance is basically a portable SNES).  All you need is the gamecube console, the GBA Adaptor, and some GBA games.  You don't actually need to own the gameboy advance handheld.  My only warning, Make SURE if you buy this used you get the DISC!  Without the boot disc, the GBA adapter is just a useless hunk of plastic!

If you pick this up, check out these exclusive GBA titles:

B00D6NMYE8,5.0,"Its a neat concept and if I was a kid, I would be all over this.  It's both a form of video game, and collection frenzy.  You get the figures so you can play them in game, and you also want to buy the figures so you can get the entire collection.  Activision just keeps taking my money!  The kids love it and want every figure that comes out.

The game itself is pretty cool and fun and offers loads of entertainment.  It is not for die hard gamers, but if you have kids, all their friends are probably playing it so you know you will have to get it.

It's all the rage right now and all my little family members love it.  You can't go wrong with Skylanders for little ones.  Just make sure you buy the correct starter pack for your system as it is available for pretty much every platform.

Things I like about it:
-combat is fast-paced and engaging. Very much like Xenoblade's. If you haven't played the first, think FFXII but with more input. Your character will do auto attacks but it takes so much more than that to win battles.

- the world is huge and beautiful to look at. I like running around and just discovering new places.

-if you like collecting things, theres lots of stuff to collect via loot and treasures on the map

-so many side quests!

-the music. Granted, it took me a while to get used to it. Its different, to say the least; but its good.

B00GD962OA,5.0,"I usually buy every console that gets released so i'm a little late to the Wii U party. My biggest reason for purchasing the Wii U is that I love, love Nintendo 1st party games. So looking forward to Super Mario Bros, Pikmin and the entire Nintendo franchises on the Wii U made it appealing to me.

I really like what Nintendo did with the gamepad and some of it's features like being able to play directly from the game pad. The graphics are on par with the PS3 and Xbox 360 but on average look cleaner on the Wii U since the hardware specs are slightly better than both systems. The system is small and appears to be well built. My biggest annoyance with the system is that purchasing a Wii U vertical stand is required if you don't want to lay it flat. If Nintendo had made the bottom side flat you could have stood it up. So it's either purchase a stand or lay it flat.

My last reason for finally pulling the trigger on the Wii U is that i've become annoyed with the lack of disk space on both PS4 and Xbox One since both consoles require you to install the games and updates on average are 1-2GB for AAA titles.

I like being able to play games directly from the disc and not deal with huge game updates so that was another bonus for the Wii U. Now i'm waiting for the release of Mario Kart 8 and the announcement of Animal Crossing on the Wii U.",Love This System
B002BSA20M,5.0,"In the fall of 2010 most gamers already knew that Halo: Reach would be the final Halo title Bungie studios would work on. To properly review this title we will need to address some industry standard criteria like graphics, sound, controls, playability and story for the single player campaign. The standard version just included the game and an instruction book while the legendary edition included the standard edition, various downloads, a statue and a few trinket items such as a diary and a Noble team patch. We will focus on the standard edition of the game.

 The story is set approximately five hundred years into the future. It tells the story of a human colony on a planet named Reach. Reach is second only to Earth in importance for humanity's survival. This is the story of the destruction of the planet by our future enemies, the covenant. The player controls a futuristic super soldier codenamed Spartans who can go toe to toe with most covenant forces. The story is full of emotion as players soon realize they are fighting a battle they cannot win. This makes this game unique because most games will have the heroes ultimately win in the end. Although we like to call the campaign a single player experience, with Reach four players can take on this long and satisfying campaign. Diehard Halo fans that have followed the novels and extended universe will complain that Bungie broke canon by changing how the planet Reach fell under covenant forces.

 The graphics are among the series best yet. Long gone is the extreme polish of Halo 3 which is set years after the events of Reach. Reach seems to come to life with environmental effects, indigenous life, and non-military civilians populating every nook and cranny of the game world. This world is dirty and lived in. Ever since Halo: Combat Evolved launched back in 2001 composers Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori have scored the original soundtracks. In Reach they hit the perfect chord with sweeping military themed drum lines and emotion packed brass segments. The sound effects are exactly what gamers have come to expect from these titles, nothing very innovative there.

 All of these things would be nothing without solid gameplay and Reach does not disappoint. Bungie is known for making very intuitive and groundbreaking game controls. They took an arguably stale formula and infused new mechanics and controls into this title that only a Halo game could deliver. The addition of armor abilities like the jetpack and invisibility adds versatility to the title that just can't be matched with other first person shooters. Each weapon seems to have a counter weapon that can be used against it not unlike a rock paper scissors game. There are some connectivity issues with multiplayer especially in the larger maps and game types but that should not take away from the overall experience.

 IGN's reviewer Eric Brudvig sums up the impact of Halo: Reach perfectly by saying in his 2010 review, ""Halo means so much to so many people. This is not extraordinary in the culture of videogames. What's exceptional is how many different things it means to those players""(Brudvig, 2010).

  This title is targeted at mostly males between 18 and 35 who like videogames and are most likely Halo or first person shooter fans already. Truly this is one of those titles that almost demands respect across the board because it truly represents an end of one era and the start of another. This title while not perfect can hopefully stand the test of time as one of the defining moments of gaming in the twenty-first century.",Farewell to Halo as we know it
B00D96BORK,5.0,"From the outset, I do not have much experience with advanced headsets. I have played XboxLive for years with normal headset.  This has been a major step up. The sound from other players is clear, I don't give off an echo, and I can feel the sound all around me.  But, what is even better is that it is also compatible with my computer.  The difference between the sound my laptop gives out and the headsets is just...incredible.  Even if it is just for streaming television shows.

And did I mention that it is extremely comfortable? It fits neatly around my ears and is adjustable.  Plus, there is cushion around the top of the band so that it sits softly atop your head.

B006GVLNV2,5.0,"This is one of those games that I just really enjoy playing and can't seem to figure out why there's so much hate for it.  It's not perfect but 5 stars means 'I love it' and I do.  Now that being said, I bought this game when it first came out and I didn't like it.  I actually ended up selling it shortly after, at just a $5 loss.  Back then, though, I hadn't played that many RPGs and the ones I had played were the kind that really hold your hand and help you learn how to do everything and point out everything you need to do. This is not one of those types of RPGs.  You have to learn as you go and actually invest some time and effort.  I know that's hard for some gamers out there.  I enjoy this type of game now because there's more reward when you get it all figured out.  Another reason I like this game more now is because of the upgrades the developers did to it.  The graphics are better, the framerate is better, and all the extra content adds more bang for your buck. There's tons of content.  As far as graphics and glitches, I've read reviews about the PS3 vs. Xbox 360 versions of this game, and despite what so many 360-only owners said, this version is just fine.  I also own a 360 and it seems like if a game is flawed, both versions are flawed, but in different ways.  Learn how to tweak your setting if you're not happy with something.  Also, don't expect a cheap TV to do any games justice and realize that not all games have an infinite budget and can't produce perfection.  Having a slightly lacking framerate and issues like that don't kill a game for me, either way.  I didn't have to change anything beyond inverting the Y-axis, but that's normal and not even an issue.  Overall, if you've enjoyed games like the Risen series, the original Two Worlds, Arcania 4, and so on, you will probably like this game and find it even better than the previously named games.  Even at a higher price, this version is worth it over the original release, especially having the add-on content on a disc.  If you're debating on which system to buy it for, I'd say either one is fine.  It may not truly be the 'game of the year' but it's still a lot of fun and will give you plenty of hours of gameplay.",Not GOTY but still tons of fun

B00006F2ZQ,5.0,"XBOX owners, this is what you have been waiting for. MGS2 was an enjoyable game for the PS2 in the Winter of 2001 and still is. I'm not sure why it is always considered a ""short"" game, really it depends on how you play and what you decide to do. Let's pick this one apart:
Controls:
A few minutes acquainting yourself with the feel of the XBOX controller vs. the MGS2 controls on PS2 and you're right back in the game.
Visuals:
This is where I differ from the extremists and be honest. The game is a port, sort of an expanded ""Director's Edition"" of MGS2. The XBOX hardware creates the illusion that the game surpasses it's PS2 version, but it doesn't. You'll notice faster frame-rates, load times, and smoother transitions...sure, hey it's on the XBOX hardware. That's about as far as it goes, yet, that in itself is enough. If you're thinking of a ""Halo"" or ""Dead or Alive 3"" MGS2 retooling or tweaking, you're going to be disappointed.
Gameplay:
The added missions, being able to play as Snake, and different stories will keep this offering as superior to the PS2 original. It's still the same essential story, but with so much added outside of the original story, it's worth the money. There's many things you can do with ""Substance,"" such as:
1. Play the original story
2. Register your name and play as any unlocked character and choose what you want to do in VR missions:
  a)Sneak, weapons, first person, alternate missions, and many other modes.
3. Take on the 6 campaigns called Snake Tales, all involving Snake.
4. Well, I'm going to leave out all the spoilers ;-)
Sound:
Hey, this is the XBOX version! The sound whips the PS2, especially in Dolby.
I recommend this title even if you have the original. The new offers are sure to rattle your chains again. Though, while we play, we sit and wait for MGS3. ""Substance"" will keep the franchise and fans growing stronger.",Metal Gear - The Remix

B00006599O,5.0,"I personally like hunting dinosaurs. There's something about running around with a quad-barreled shotgun and tearing into raptors that makes me feel giddy, and there's something even more fun about taking a compound bow, zooming in, and taking something's head off. Seeing little monkeys sitting in trees or prehistoric crocs swimming around and thinking, ""I should kill that"" just makes the day pass so much better. Perhaps its that ""melon hitting the sidewalk"" sound that makes it enjoyable when I fire, or perhaps it's the fact that the limbs coming off and oceans of blood flowing at a distance just look interesting.
Yeah, I like the fact that the game is interactive and that I can want up to a brontosaurus sitting in as background, it looming like a titan above the terrain, and I can introduce it to missiles that bore into its skin simply because I can. I like that grinding sound that says, ""that's gotta hurt"" to me, and it doesn't get old no matter how many of them I kill. Its so - exhilarating.
Added to that is the fact that these dinosaurs running amok aren't all beasts you've seen on the Discovery channel. Somewhere along the evolutionary pathway, some dinosaurs became bipedal, started practicing the fine art of carrying weapons and enslaving humans, and they're truly what make hunters happy. While its true that running into a stegosaurus with missiles flashing off its back is interesting (and a shock, depending on the situation), the people hiding and taking shots at you are what make it interesting. I personally like finding them, taking a weapon that lets me pick them off from afar, and watching them spout blood over the side of a cliff as they cry to their mommy gods for a better form of band-aid. And, since I'm doing it to save the human race, it alright and makes me a hero to boot.
Turok does have a few graphic problems, mind you, and it isn't a game that everyone would enjoy. Sometimes the things you have to do are a little tedious, and there are some stages I didn't like. I personally thought having to fly around on something and pick enemies off was a waste, and I could have done without some of the stealth mode boards. Still, the range of what you can accomplish, the amount of weapons and the way some things sneak up on you, makes up for that. Once you grow accustomed to having to jump in first-person (not always easy when judging distance) and control with one analog while aiming with the other, it actually improves your skills. You become a dinosaur death machine, leaving corpses with missing appendages temporarily (yes, they don't stay around too long) in your wake. And that, most of all, is what I enjoy.
I wouldn't go as far as to call this a hard concept to get, either, no would I call the missions all that difficult. I breezed through the boards pretty steadily, sometimes killing myself with weapons that didn't work the way I thought they would and sometimes setting myself on fire when I got crazy with the napalm attachment to my flame-thrower, but that was just me and not something the game did. Most of the time you simply have to get from point ""A"" to point ""B"" without getting torn up too badly by snipers, bigger guys with bigger guns, and the ever-roaming dinosaurs. And that's not that hard. In fact, you can make a game out of it now and again, baiting one on the other and introducing a gun shooter to the teeth of a beast chasing you as you mad dash to get away from it. That was a fun feat for me because I liked moving through the terrain and killing, and I like killing with style. The only thing missing was a wall to hang the heads of things I killed on.
Added to that are the interesting little games you can play on two-player mode, making it something you can break out and humiliate your friends with. Some weapons only work in two-player settings, giving you new objectives to tack on to competition, and there are a few setting that let you exclusively do certain things when wanting to burn a little time. You can fight with only clubs and bows, for instance, opt to have all the weapons, get stronger every time you pick off a player, and a multitude of other things. And everyone knows that the ultimate humiliation is getting a chance to hold down a friend on a game, beat on them, and then laugh a lot at them in front of a host of their peers.
I personally feel that anyone that likes hunting games, enjoying tracking their enemies down or tearing into wildlife that sometimes reacts to it, might want to give it a try. I like games that let me simulate hunting bear and mountain lions, but what's a bear when compared to the chance to plug an armed Thunder Lizard with my compound bow? You simply have to overlook a few of the graphic problems, understand that the enemies' sounds are redundant and that they aren't that smart, that it is a quick play, and you'll be fine. So, happy hunting, and please, for the sake of the dino children, quit trying to eat those lizards you kill! Their families would like to have an open casket funeral at least one out of three times (the odds of them getting out of a good headshot), you know!","Roll Over, Fetch, Die: Things to Teach Your Pet Dinosaurs!"
B001AAAVPI,5.0,"Really most people are probably not ""underwhelmed"" by any means with what this console could do back in the day.  Prior to the early 90's, it kept up with the Mega Drive sales and abolished its sibling companies in the land of the eastern sun, but it lacked the punch or polish it needed to push itself through the North American market with any real charm or presence.  By charm I truly mean or truly hope NEC at some point realized (but never re-evaluated) how odd it was to practically double the size of a system for its North American release.  Perhaps they were frightened of sales falling when compared to the Genesis, but perhaps their marketing team was a bunch of idiots.  Of course they had to be, what with all the insanely overpriced attachments that were sold alongside it.  You needed an attachment for a second controller, a cord to extend the controller (which were notorious for being absolutely too short) and with the CD-Add-on it required several system cards to actually utilize itself.  This was probably the worst way to advertise your system and we all saw the exact same thing years later with SEGA of North America when they also shot themselves in the foot repeatedly.  The problem with NEC was that they were firing a machine gun.  They advertised their system on a lie, a lie that it was as powerful as the competition when it was quite clearly not, it was advertised as being the first to utilize the CD medium, but had so many DOA or just plain cancelled titles for the actual system that nobody cared and nobody wanted a console that looked the way it did (terribly large and ugly) at such a terribly high price tag.  It wasn't showcased to be any much better than the NES or the Sega Master System, though it did blow the systems out of the water in Japan amusingly enough.  It stagnated until it was utterly defeated.  The console prices, their variants, and even the prices of the  accessories dropped substantially before disappearing into an oblivion of marketing failure.  However, the battle it lost long ago was eventually realized by collectors and now it certainly has taken on a long-lost life of its own in terms of value and robust-appeal.  Its a very sturdy console, it features a rather modest library, and it easily garnishes niche appeal for being such an under dog in such a massively up hill battle with its competition.  One could even say that casual console owners and consumers have no place purchasing the TurboGrafx 16.  Lack of respect for everything the console did attempt and achieved is the main reason it still gets the attention it ""does"" deserve.  It bridged the gap of the early 90's and even surprised its competitors with its tenacity.  Even its programmers threw a few flailing jabs out at the face of their opposition with such infamous Japanese Super CD titles like ""Rondo of Blood"" and many other games that never saw our American shores.  Though not as commanding or as influential as the Super Nintendo Entertainment console or as ferocious as the war it had against the Genesis in North America, the Turbografx 16 remains as the link from 8-bit to 16-bit and the first real significance of the now popular CD-media based video games we have all come to love.",Collectors only.. if you enjoy that sort of thing.

B0013RATNM,5.0,"That should speak for itself.  This game is highly entertaining. I made the mistake of trading it back after I completed it and still regret the decision, especially since the price hasn't gone down at all.

If you are intrigued by gameplay involving a Grapple Hook and a Parachute done right (Lost Planet, Bionic Commando anyone?) and can sit through a somewhat hoaky story just to enjoy the fun filled island.  This game should be on your list.

Did i mention you can grapple onto planes in the air, reel yourself in, hijack them, fly really high and jump off for some skydiving fun, before opening your parachute and landing on say an oil rig, destroying that and use your grapple hook to snag a patrol boat, narrowly escaping the ensuing oil rig explosion before setting off do something equally awesome?

B000NJFMUQ,5.0,"Terrific dungeon-crawling RPG using a third-person view. Graphics are terrific, although you will need a powerful computer to run this game in its full glory. But slower computers can run the game if you dial down the ""eye candy"" and you'll still get an enjoyable experience out of it.

Some have complained about the horse control and there is a bit of a learning curve in controlling the horse. But using a horse is necessary to get to places on the map quicker than walking (there are portals to get you to places very fast, but most of the time you will have to walk or ride to accomplish everything you need to in this game -- and there is a LOT to do. I played this game for 2-3 hours every day for a month and hadn't even explored half the map.

The only problems I saw with the horse were the horse occasionally will suddenly turn and want to go a different way (sometimes that's the result of enemies being nearby or you may be too close to something like a large rock, and if you get on a large rock, the horse may get stuck there (although you will be able to get off the horse and off the rock), and in some cases the horse will not enter or leave towns. This seemed to happen mostly with towns that are fortified with log walls -- I could sometimes enter a town but in trying to pass through it, the horse would refuse to exit the other gate, and sometimes I could not enter a town on a horse. This may have been something the designers did.

There are no loading screens between the map areas, which gives the impression that you're just exploring one huge map. Occasionally there will be a few seconds delay as you pass from one area to the next, but this is usually very quick. This may be the reason for horses not being able to go anywhere and everywhere.

Riding the horse is just too cool. I've ridden real horses, so it was surprising how well the horses in the game work -- walking, trotting, cantering, and galloping.

There are caves and dungeons to explore -- almost too many. Some are small, others are huge and the enemies are usually pretty tough.

Weapons and spells are plentiful and of many different types. Numerous merchants will sell you everything you need and then some. You can gather herbs and create potions, some of which will enhance your weapons and spells. As you pick up weapons of the same type, some can be added to a weapon you already have to make it more powerful.

About the only complaint is the game is too big. You'll spend a lot of time walking and riding around trying to find everything. For me, that part is enjoyable, but some may find it drudgery in which case you can just concentrate on the quests, of which there are many.

I could go on and on about this game, but if you like this type of game, try the demo at least. I think you'll be hooked.",Great Third-person RPG

B00DWXV1CI,5.0,"FINALLY, Angry Birds Star Wars had come out for 3DS, PS3, PS4, Wii U, XBOX 1, XBOX 360 and VITA for the first time ever since it came out for PC and Android. The controls are the same, the graphics are beautiful, and the rules are the same from Angry Birds. The rules are simple: you launch a bird against pigs and killing them, after you killed the pigs, you go the next level. The higher the level, the more difficult the level will become, because the pigs are hidden in blocks of ice, wood, glass, rocks, and steel beams even they are hanging or protected by TIE Fighters or armed with blasters. In each level, you get a bird of different colors, and like Angry Birds, the birds had different abilities, but this time this game is Star Wars. Red is normal, but later he will have new abilities like his lightsaber attacks, yellow will fire a blaster, big red is a wrecking ball and will causes earthquakes, white splits into 5 robot parts, black uses the force to push blocks, blue splits into 3, the egg fires a electric beam, pink fires a tractor beam from her blaster, and the Millennium Falcon is used instead The Mighty Eagle, (it cannot be used again and again like Angry Birds, but you have to earn certain number of stars in other levels and it is not devastating as The Mighty Eagle). This game had all of the levels like Android IOS, but you have to unlock them on certain conditions. The pigs are based on the villains from Star Wars: Storm Trooper, Sand People, TIE Fighters, Death Star Troopers, Imperial Troopers, Boba Fett, and The Emperor except Darth Vader (because Darth Vader is a bird/cyborg hybrid not a pig/cyborg hybrid you have to find out on Angry Birds Star Wars 2). The birds are based on the heroes from Star Wars: Red is Luke Skywalker, Yellow is Han Solo and Lando, White is 3PO, Egg is R2-D2, Blue is a Rebel pilot, Pink is Leia, Big Red is Chewbacca, and Black is Obi-Wan. As a loyal fan of Angry birds, if you do not have Android IOS or have a boring PC game of Angry Birds Star Wars with few unlockables and no Millennium Falcon, you can buy this game for any system you like.",The Force is strong with the Flock

B01DUHQIL4,5.0,"I own soo many headphones that I really don't need anymore (kind of getting sick of them); that being said, however, all the hype on these headphones really got me curious to see for myself. It's no surprise everyone is giving this a 5 stars and would even sell out of stock.

These headphones really aren't just made for gaming, but worthy for all-purpose media. Before ""gaming headphones"" were only optimized for gaming and it sounded horrible when it came to music. You actually get some great soundstage with these headphones for music; yes, you can hear the distinct separation.

I connected the USB dongle to my laptop and listened to some music, and I was pretty impressed.

It comes with an attachable mic, which will give you a much more better isolated sound, but it also has a built-in mic even if you don't have it attached.

What I love the most is how the whole earcups for both sides are large volume dials; I think this is really cool and much easier to adjust than headphones that place a bunch of tiny buttons on the side trying to figure out where it is.

The right headphone earcup dial controls the GAME SOUND volume (rotating clockwise increases volume).
The left headphone earcup dial controls the MIC  SOUND volume.

Pressing the center of the earcup for the right mutes the MIC SOUND (when the mic is muted, the microphone LED turns blue)
Pressing the center of the earcup for the left mutes the GAME SOUND

I don't know why they reversed it. Personally, I think right side knob dial controls the in-game sounds, so pressing the button on that side also should mute those sounds.

The manual suggests to connect to the console using optical cable (included); however, since I'm already using the optical out on my PS4/PS3 for my main speakers (don't want to go through the hassle of unplugging/replugging), the sound still works and sounds great just sticking the USB in (For PS4, hold the PS button until you get the 'Quick Menu' and go to 'Adjust Sound and Devices' and set ""Output to Headphones"" to ""All Audio"")

There is a EQ button on the right side of the headphone, which has 3 different settings. 1 beep is the default, 2 beeps seems to give more bass, and 3rd beep mode seems to eliminate all the low frequency, which actually gives a raw feeling to me.

Headphones are a very secure fit; it might feel a little tight, but you definitely get the sound more directly towards your ear/large earcups giving a nice secluded feeling.

I really really wish these headphones could just connect to mobile devices via bluetooth and stay wireless, but they require the use the AUX 3.5mm cable, which is a shame. If that was possible, this would have been the ultimate wireless headphones to own for PC, console, and mobile use.

Pros:
- Very clean Stylish; Classy; does not look like a silly ""gaming"" headphone
- Wireless (via USB dongle)
- Great volume/sound stage/secluded/immersive feeling
- Love the large volume dials on the earcups; I'm a big fan of this unique brilliant design. Why nobody else makes it like this?
- Built-in EQ (3 settings to choose from; if you like bass then set it to mode 2. If you like a raw feeling, especially shooters, I like the 3rd mode)

Cons:
- Wish it had Bluetooth/wireless for mobile phones too (then this headphone would have been 6 stars and just be the ultimate all purpose headphones)
- Wish the power on/off was a switch instead of holding button; I really hate holding on to the button because it takes too long and I just find switches to be more convenient; or at least turn on with one press of a button.

It's definitely easily a highly recommendable headphone. Quite possibly the best wireless gaming/all-purpose headphones out there. For this headphone to still give excitement to people who own lots of headphones already is definitely saying something. This has become my favorite wireless headphones (I really wish I could use this wirelessly with my phone!).",Worth the hype. Clean Stylish All-Purpose headphones

B01GW8YDLK,5.0,"This game is the reason why I had to get the PS4 and man I love this game so much Im a huge Spidey nerd. Once I heard this game was coming out it was a must have, so the story takes place 8yrs after the rookie events of Spider-Man so hes basically getting use to his powers ect. But the story just throws you in the action of Spidey then boom you're playing however this is the darkest story of peter Parker yet  which aims for the older audiences so to speak. The sound track has its own unique sound kinda reminds of a halo in a way super soft and smooth but man when the action happens the soundtrack delivers big time. Gameplay has alittle touch of the Arkham Asylum vibe but it holds its own with a challenges ect. Graphics are very polish and nice The only con about this game is one thing it ended lol I was having so much fun with this game and finely we get to see Spider-Man getting his own game that he deserves. Cant wait to see what Insomniac has to deliver next Im so pump about this game",Such a spectacular game !
B0000657SP,5.0,"I have played all the Resident Evil games except for the origonal Resident Evil for Playstation.  That is partially why I turned in my beloved Dreamcast for a gamecube, to play this game.  I had high expectations, of this there is no doubt.  But I have been amply rewarded so far for my move in a new direction.
Some of the reviews I read complained about the strange or ""[junky]"" controls.  I am not sure I understand this.  Resident Evil offers a pre-set control that will be comfortable to any returning player.  It also offers another default setting that may be more comfortable to newer players.  And if I am not mistaken (I loved setting A so I didn't look into this too close), option C lets you set the controls however you like.
Another complaint I read about was getting lost in the game or quickly running out of ammunition.  This is a totally common experience to all Resident Evil players.  It is part of the game style itself.  The test is whether you drop the controller and run like a [WIMP] or you pick it back up and get BACK IN THE GAME!  Honestly, it is survival horror, not Duke Nukem!  What do you expect, a Gatling gun and red pointing arrows?
On the plus side, YES! Resident Evil now has graphics on par with even the best of computer games.  You can prepare to be amazed.  It also has almost perfect physics, meaning the pistol acts like a pistol and your charactor moves like they are real (trust me on this).  Heavy weapons have a very satisfying (i.e. zombie mutilating) effect as well.  At first I was worried that the low weapon count would draw the game down in comparison to RE 2.  But I was wrong.  Each gun is fun and there is more than enough variety to please even a NRA President.
New players beware!  This Resident Evil is huge!  It is much larger than any of the other Resident Evil games I have played yet.  Not just in size but in complexity.  Even on easy, I was struggling to slove the puzzles in the game.  You will spend a lot of time exploring and backtracking.  If this is not your bag, do like me and buy a strategy guide.  I tried not to use it at first but...I am weak.  Know if you are too when purchasing.
As a final note and one thing I think is important, many players confess being scared by the Resident Evil games.  I was never one.  Even Code Veronica, with its great graphics and ominous tone did not scare me.  Imagine my suprise when I realized I wasn't turning on the Gamecube after dark.  Resident Evil Gamecube is actually scary to me, a vetran of the series.  If you get the creeps and like it, then meet your new best friend....","Ummm...Hello, I am A Resident Evil player."

Again like in previous reviews, I mainly buy games to collect and display, and this title also came with that nasty used sticker on the case, covering the box art. I have played through this title twice already. The load time that took forever on the PS3, at the start of the game is gone. Quick loads and excellent improved visuals. I wouldn't say it's greatly improved, but it is crisper and cleaner then the last gen predecessor. Side by side, the PS3 looks a little muddy by comparison. Not as bad as COD Ghost on PS3 compared to PS4, but very noticeable. All around great title. If your new to the Playstation brand, this is a great place to start. If you brought this on PS3, no real need to grab this for your PS4. Unless your like me and like to collect, otherwise save your cash for other titles.","Got this used at a great deal, and the condition is excellent"
B000066TS5,5.0,"At first glance Kingdom Hearts seems like a game that only a child would enjoy.  But at second glance the game is an RPG masterpiece!  With a great storyline, great music, top notch voice acting and a Unique way to battle and move around, the game easily scores a five.
You control a young Boy named Sora (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) and he travels through the different realms of the Disney Kingdom trying to stop the heartless in an attempt to restore piece to the land and save the world.  While not as good as previous RPGs, this gives RPGers a little something different to enjoy.
Battling is a little different.  To sum it all up, its very similar to Secret of Mana and Legend of Mana.  Thus meaning you can't control your two sub characters but you control the main one.  For each enemy you defeat you get MP orbs and HP orbs to restore health (like candy in Legend of Mana).  This is also interesting because when running around in towns you can choose to pick up something or other events.
The characters present a more animated look.  I know that by some of the people they'll say its a kids game becasue of the disney characters (shame on you gamers for not even trying it first).  The voice acting for these characters is top notch with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice of Sora. Characters from the Final Fantasy series are here too. From Aeris and Cloud, to Squall and Yuffie, to the legendary Sephiroth.  The only problem is that Lance Bass is the voice of Sephiroth and while to some it doesn't seem like much, to those who've played FF7 they know that Lance Bass doesn't have the Sephiroth voice.
The graphics are amazing and they look very realistic.  The music is great, and gameplay is too.  But if you've seen the disney moves a lot then you'll note that you might know the outcome of some events being that its like playing through the disney movie itself.
This game also takes a new step in the RPG world.  When you select a new game you can choose to select Expert mode or Normal mode.  Not to mention that you can also answer the first series of question to decide how fast your characters level up!  So you could put it on expert and level up slowly for a hard experience.
Don't judge this so much on the characters, if your like me this game is good Nostalga for a Disney Lover like myself.  The gameplay is unique and the game has several mini-games and side quest.  It has a ton of secrets as well. The only other problem with this game is the annoying camera angles.
OVERALL the game desrves a five.

B00004SVS7,5.0,"I'm actually surprised. At first, I was kinda losing hope for this game after hearing that it wasn't as good as MegaMan 3 or 2. But you know what? The people that said those things were wrong. MegaMan 6 was totally worth it.

As always, you have eight robot masters to fight. You know what's different here? Two of these guys were actually made by the FANS rather than the creators! Nintendo Power (the magazine) held a contest for designing new robot masters. The winners' robots in this game were Knight Man and Wind Man. Congratulations, guys.

The basic gameplay is fun and unharmed in this game. In fact, there are cool new additions here, such as using Rush as a new set of armor. Using the armor, you can either fly (That comes in handy at times) or use super strength. Other fun elements include charging up your Mega Buster and sliding through gaps.

While the game is fun, the story feels a little lacking for some reason. In this game, a new villain named Mr. X has attempted to take over, but as it just so turns out, it was Dr. Wily's doing all along. I feel like since this IS the 6th game, it would be expected that Dr. Wily would be doing all this. After all, we are aware that he is a mainstay to the series.

As with all of Capcom's 8-Bit games, the graphics are extremely detailed and cool. The music is also well-composed, but I'm not sure if it will remain to be as memorable as the early MegaMan games' soundtracks.

But overall, this is a great game and I think you should go buy it. If a copy's too expensive, buy MegaMan Anniversary Collection for Xbox, Gamecube, or PS2.",MegaMan still tackled his 8-Bit groove

B00005ML10,5.0,"The game is worth playing through just because of the idea of this shadow government run by the patriots. Hideo Kojima has a very scary message for people that think they live in a democracy and they are free. This story is so detailed, better then 90% of any thing Hollywood can come up with.
I have one problem with this game. I bought the strategy guide and still this game was one of the hardest games I have ever played. If you played through Metal Gear Solid then I think it would make it easier. This did not prevent me from finishing the game however.

B00005NZ1G,5.0,"Halo lands you in the role of the Master Chief.  He is the last of his kind.  A genetically enhanced super soldier and the ultimate weapon against the Covenant.  The game begins with you being shot down on the ancient ring world of Halo.  Your mission is to regroup with the remaining survivors from your colony and drive the alien race away from earth.
The graphics in this game are amazing.  Even though they run at only 30 frames per second.  The particle effects, the snow, the weapons, everything looks great.  The controls are awesome and take no time getting used to.  The only button that was any trouble at all was the left thumbstick when I tried to crouch and move at the same time.  Still though great button layout and makes use of all the buttons.
After playing this game for countless hours I can verify it is totally addicting.  There are plenty of different weapons and vehicles to become familiar with.  Your weapons range from Assault Rifles, Shotguns and Sniper Rifles to Plasma Rifles and Stationary guns.  There are four vehicles that you will find in the game, Warthog(recon vehicle), Scorpion(Tank), Ghost(skimmer) and the Banshee(plane).  My one complaint is that you repeat many of the same levels at the end of the game.
The true strength of this game though is in the multiplayer option.  You can play threw the campain with friends.  Also there are other multiplayer games like Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Slayer, Oddball and Race.  In my eyes this game is a system seller.

B001IZIAK8,5.0,"Since this bundle isn't much more expensive than a stand alone Blu Ray player and having the ability to play the latest games, the PS3 seemed like a no brainer with a starting price of 400.

I love the finish on the MGS4 edition PS3.  Hooked it up to my Sony XBR 65"" CRT projection TV using a set of Sony gold plated component cables available on Amazon and I am finally able to see the true output quality of this TV at 1080i. I picked up 3 Blu Ray movies and sampled one last night, 'Wanted', spectacular!

As for gaming, My previous platform is the PS2.  Moving from GT4 on the PS2 to GT5 on the PS3 isn't quite as big a jump as going from an Atari 2600 to the PS2, but if it were any better, I'd have to be in the actual car driving on the actual road.

My only complaint is that it can be a little awkward to fit the controller in them.

B000930DLE,5.0,"A question before the review starts.  Have you ever been in a jam and just wish you could force your way through all that pesky traffic?  You CAN now!  Burnout 4th title is nothing short of fantastic.

As stated in the previous paragraph, you can now hit the traffic without crashing yourself.  This is called ""Traffic Checking"" and it is a very good method to causing your opponents to crash.  Have a rival hit a checked car or truck and they'll crash!

Another new feature is that the new levels in Revenge are now made for destruction.  Ramps, Shortcuts, and even barriers make for great crash sites.

Also, a new and revamped Crash mode is featured.  According to a Burnout ad, ""It's like golf... but with cars"".  For all of you new to the series, the objective of Crash is to cause a pile-up and destroy as many cars as possible.  You can now get a running start with a help of a meter similar to the one in Madden.

Another new thing is the addition of crashbreakers to crash mode and some races.  Have you ever thought of putting a bomb in your car?  Of course you haven't, but Criterion did.  Upon crashing in race, you can detonate your car with the touch of the B Button (you will lose all your boost if you don't hit a rival, however).  In Crash, you can use a crashbreaker after you crash enough cars.  When you see ""Crashbreaker in 5"", you have 5 seconds (or until you hit 100%) to charge your bomb.  Tap B to get the Crashbreaker meter up.  The higher the meter is, the better the explosion!

B00007LV7Z,5.0,"In previews, Zone of the Enders seemed like it was going to be one of the Greatest Games of All Time. Unfortunately it ended up being a bit of a dud. Not a horrible game, but nowhere near meeting expectations. The combat itself was OK at first, but it quickly became repetetive. Aside from the bosses, there were only three enemy types. The game was filled with boring seek-and-fetch quests, an unappealing simpering lead character (that kid made Shinji from EVA look like Clint Eastwood,) uninteresting environments, useless sub-weapons, it was too easy, the story wasn't very exciting, the voice acting was abysmal, and so on and so forth. All it really had going for it was state of the art graphics, satisfying boss battles (well, except for the last one) and a VERY cool mech to fly around in. Oh, and a great soundtrack. But the bad more or less outweighed the good, and so the announcement of a sequel didn't really increase my heart rate. However, the current issue of OPM came with a ZOE2 demo, so I gave it a spin. I can't begin to tell you how much of an improvement it seemed to be over the original. I was so impressed that I immediately ran out and picked up the import even though the domestic version is less than a month away. Everything, EVERYTHING about ZOE1 has been improved upon, even the things it did well. Some notable changes are:

* More enemies and targets appearing onscreen, a LOT more. This game is much more hectic and chaotic than the original, which seemed laid back a lot of the time. Enemies are more agressive, and some of the boss battles are more difficult than anything from ZOE1.

* The lead character actually has some charisma going for him. The story (what I've been able to make out with my non-existent Japanese fluency) is gripping, or at least interesting. Characters actually have relationships with each other. Things actually happen to them. The story itself is told via very high quality anime, rather than ZOE1's 3D CG.

* There's more variety in the gameplay itself. Rather than just contiunually roaming through area after area and beating up enemies and looking for programs, you'll chase down huge armored battle-trains, solve puzzles, and follow precise verbal cues or DIE. You can also now grab enemies and use them as melee weapons, and grab pieces of the environment to use as weapons or shields.

The only real flaw I can think of is that the game's voice acting isn't up to the standard of other Konami productions, such as the Metal Gear Solid series or the Silent Hill series. It may be a notch or two above the truly atrocious acting in ZOE1, but that's not saying much.

Trust me, if you liked ZOE1 at all, you'll be amazed at how great ZOE2 is.",ZOE2 finally delivers on all of ZOE1's empty promises

B0009A4EVM,5.0,"Kingdom Hearts nailed the right market at the right time bringing in millions of dollars for both Square-Enix and Disney. The second instalment offers nothing really new but managed to fix all the flaws in the first game, perfecting the art of this title.

Kingdom Hearts II continued with what's left behind in Chains of Memory on GBA. The plot thickens as you started off the game with an all new main character. It is also because of this that you can see other new Final Fantasy characters popping up in this new environment. This offers you a whole new surprise for the game.

The story is well written and it gives you twists and turns here and there to keep you going. Things that you thought were explained popped up in a way that you noticed that they were never actually resolved. This is the same for the story in Chains of Memory. Haven't played the first two games? No worries, Square-Enix had written the story in a way that provides tons of flash backs to bring you up to speed with the chronology of the Kingdom Hearts world.

In terms of gameplay, the battle system is more or less the same as the last one but with some new and minor updates. Now you have limit breaks and overdrive gauges. Veterans of Final Fantasy games will immediately notice that these are ideas from Final Fantasy VIII and X. Once unleashed with these commands when conditions are met you are rewarded with an extravaganza of battle combo. Also this time round, you have an option of not just going out hack and slash but deploy a more tactical approach in battles. The trigger command using the Triangle button allows you to employ battle related tactics response that could help you speed up the battle with context related attacks. This works for both random battles and boss fights. So you have an option of scarificing your X button all the way or use a more tactical approach to battles, which I think is pretty clever. The summon system is back and worked exactly the same way as last time round, though you will have new summons and some of them are actually hilarious than useful. The menu system is still not that friendly when it comes to battle despite you can have a quick menu to assist in battle. However, commands related to overdrive and limit breaks are still limited to menu driven and since battle is real time, it sometimes become pretty chaotic if you are not familiar with the menu.

The moogle synthesise shop is back too and so is the battle arena. The weapon system is a mixed of traditional Final Fantasy game and the Final Fantasy X ability system. So you have to think about how you want your characters to be. The abitlity system remains the same - which is similar to the ability system in Final Fantasy IX.

Another big improvement is the troublesome camera angle that plagued the first game. Remember how you swore in the battle with Ushula in the first game? The enemy is huge but the camera is stuck most of the time. The camera angle this time round are more flexible and Square-Enix have fixed most of the problems. The battle with Hydra proved that they had spent quite a bit of time dealing with the problem. However, when you have Beast in the party, he sometimes blocks your view and because of its size, the camera is sometime locked, which could still be frustrating.

The Gummi Ship is back and now Gummi Ship battles are more interesting cos you have different areas that actually show differences. Also, you win new prints by winning those battles, which gives you some incentive to do them.

In all, Kingdom Hearts II is a well balanced game that fixed a lot of previous flaws and improved upon the franchise's formula. It is a good game with a very gripping storyline. New areas that are added in this installment provides huge incentives for you to carry on with the game - remember to say hi to Johnny Depp when you see him in the game :)",A perfection of the original game

Although this version of the Playstation 3 is still in its early days (remember the difference between PS 2 and PS 2 slim?) and that incredible potentials for games have yet to be truly discovered, what you are really getting here is a real computer with blu-ray HD technolgy (HD-DVD market is just a passed-technology-based joke, no doubt about it) web-browser, hard drive (you can watch videos, pictures, mp3s), bluetooth wireless controller (works just fantastic) and a virtual ""heavy-weight"" black painted brick (this thing is HUGE) for a price which, by itself, it would not cover the expense for a good basic blu-ray disc player alone.

If you are thinking about PS 2 games compatibility, just consider this: even if you have never owned a Playstation 2, do you really NEED to spend money and time for an older technology?

B003LDKJEA,5.0,"Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Tag Team retains all the fast paced and explosive action from previous Tenkaichi titles all in one portable package.

The bulk of the game is in Dragon Walker. In this mode you will go through the entire Dragon Ball Z story from the arrival of Goku's brother Raditz to the defeat of Majin Buu. You will spend plenty of time in the over-world map guiding your fighter to certain destinations and encountering various foes. Despite it's similarities to Shin Budokai Another World's over-world map, Tenkaichi Tag Team manages to make it bearable enough and even sometimes fun. Who doesn't like to see their favorite Dragon Ball Z characters brought down to size with huge bobble heads? A frequent problem with Another Road was repetition. You would have to battle the same enemy numerous times consecutively, even if he isn't your primary target. This can grow tiresome even to the most die-hard Dragon Ball Z fan. This is still an issue in Tenkaichi Tag, and sometimes it's downright horrendous. Enemies are spaced out much further and are easier to avoid. It's really rather simple to make your way straight to your primary target without worrying about bumping into a random enemy and wasting time on a needless fight. The developers decided to be nice this time and give you a chance to avoid a random battle even if an enemy is right on your tail. For example, if you are using Goku, you can press the square button to use Solar Flare to temporarily blind any nearby enemies. You can then make your escape.

However, for those of you looking to obtain every unlockable item, you should probably reconsider playing the story mode, and opt to download the sav file instead. That is, of course, unless you feel you're up to the repetitiveness that Dragon Walker will offer. To unlock just one item, sometimes you will have to complete various objectives. Everything from full-filling a task for a non-playable character, facing a special adversary, to defeating each and every enemy on the map. Artificial longevity is what I would call this. It isn't fun and can prove to be downright frustrating. Not because it's too hard, not at all. If anything Dragon Walker is too easy. What's frustrating is that there are so many sets of enemies, so not only will completing this one task take a while, sometimes you may not be able to complete it at all. That's because the enemies are spaced out too far, and some even navigate the map which makes them harder to find. I can count at least two occurrences where I thought I had defeated every enemy, only to find out after finishing the chapter that I missed one despite spending 10 -15 minutes scouring the map in search of any others.

Despite it's short-comings, Dragon Walker is an ok re-telling of the classic Dragon Ball Z tale for the die-hard fan who already knows the story, but less than stellar for anyone who may not be familiar with Dragon Ball. The story-telling is choppy for one and don't be surprised if you find a typo or two.

In Tenkaichi Tag Team's Free Battle mode you can choose to relive classic fights from the series or create your own. Want Future Trunks to duke it out with his kid self from the Buu arc? You can do that and pretty much any other fight you can imagine. The action is identical to that of previous installments in the Tenkaichi series (that's right, all the biggest and baddest moves from Tenkaichi 3 are still here) with some control revisions due to the PSP's lack of secondary shoulder buttons and dual analog nubs. It's mostly the same so Tenkaichi veterans shouldn't take too long to become accustomed to the new control configurations. New-comers will find the controls comfortable and easy to learn. You can also make use of the training mode to get the hang of the game's unusual third person perspective and to develop your skills for use against the CPU or friends in the Multiplayer mode.

Now to what the game is all about, two on two matches. Playing two on two on the hardest difficulty can prove to be a frantic and fast paced experience. It is the game's primary gimmick and for the most part, it delivers it well. The fights are fun but can be problematic at times. Sometimes when you're concentrating on one thing, your enemy's ally will blast you from out of nowhere, but that can be forgiven since it isn't that much of a detriment to the overall two-on-two experience. It's always fun to pair unlikely allies together and see what snide comments they make prior to a match's commencement. Things get rough in the last portions of Battle 100 though. On the last stages of the final group of battles, you pick a team of two characters to battle the computer controlled teams. The frustrating thing about this is that both teammates of the opposing team will primarily focus on you, the player, while mostly ignoring your partner. So instead of 'tag', these will be more like handicap matches. If that isn't enough, their attack and defensive abilities are so high, that you will be near death within seconds if you're not careful.

Sound: DBZ Tenkaichi Tag Team is full of awesome sound effects that give that extra oomph to your matches. The background music is mostly generic with only a couple of standout themes. The voice overs are great as always, though there are some notable voice changes. Stephanie Nadolny (Gohan) and Linda Young (Freeza) have been replaced by the folks who voice these characters for Dragon Ball Z Kai. Although I prefer Linda and Stephanie Nadolny, these new voice actors certainly voiced their parts well.

Graphics: The graphics are definitely a step down from the console versions, though that's to be expected. The venues and character models can at times look blurry but that's hardly a deterrent considering the game has great game-play and replayability.

Pros:

Decent Story Mode: Not perfect and downright ridiculous at times but it gets the job done

Over 70 Characters to choose from (counting transformed states). For example, Goku (Super Saiyan 1) and Goku (Super Saiyan 3) both count as separate characters.

Deeper In-game transformations. You can choose Goku's base form then transform into Super Saiyan, and then to Super Saiyan 2 and 3. You can also transform into Super Saiyan 2 or 3 straight from base form by using the analog nub while pressing the select button. You can also undo a transformation. For example, if you're in Super Saiyan 2 mode, you can quickly return to base mode by pressing Down + Select.

Great Fighting Mechanics: If you loved the Tenkaichi series on the Playstation 2 and on the Wii, you will love it here. Tenkaichi Tag Team is identical in nearly every way with the only major difference being it's portability.

Cons:

Difficulty: The only thing that prevents this game from surpassing or being as good as previous installments in the Tenkaichi franchise is the game's difficulty. It is far too easy. While it is suspected that the general difficulty may have been decreased to accommodate the new two on two feature, it leaves the one on one experience lacking in excitement. To ramp up the difficulty you should consider using default characters against fully customized characters. Give yourself 2 senzus and give the CPU 4 senzu beans. It's cheap but it sure beats playing against the regular AI.

Repetitiveness: Having to kill 10 sets of the same enemies on one map, really?

Despite these flaws, I highly recommend this game to all Dragon Ball Z fanatics. It is very well worth the $39.99 price tag. After all, it is a portable version of Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 with two on two features, what more could you possibly want? Except for a harder difficulty of course. :)",Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Tag Team Review

B00006IJJK,5.0,"After the great Metroid Fusion, I could expect nothing less from the queen of shooters' excursion onto the GameCube--and I got everything and nothing I expected. Prime is nothing like the previous four Metroid games in terms of gameplay--but I'm not complaining. Prime sucked me in and kept me there, fighting past hordes of enemies and the toughest, most creative bosses in YEARS (thanks Nintendo!) and hunting for tough-to-reach powerups through incredibly innovative puzzles, and looking at some of the best graphics of any game on the GameCube. I'm not just saying that--one look at some of the best monsters ever created and you'll swear you'll never go back to PlayStation. And the game doesn't end with the awesome final fight--no, no, you can connect with your copy of Metroid Fusion to play the original Metroid on your 'Cube. Prime has at least fifteen hours of gameplay on that beautiful little Gamecube disc. Have fun with them.",One word: WOW.

I have to say that the game was so interactive and the motion control on the handheld system was so much better than in any other system or any other version of this game that I have seen before.

B0050SWR6M,5.0,"I was amazed when I first fired this up and realized that I could hit the gas and move the car. I thought the game was still playing a cutscene, that's how good it looks. I cannot believe visuals and gameplay like this are possible on a portable system. A friend of mine stopped over and saw me playing it and thought I was streaming the game from the PS4. To say the visuals are great is an understatement, they are jaw-dropping. And the game moves every bit as good. The gameplay is as fun as ever, it reminds me of Most Wanted on the Xbox 360 when it launched. You race around and build up your reputation and garage, when you get to a certain level you can challenge the next most wanted guy on the list. The controls are precise and the sound is every bit as good as the visuals, especially with a decent set of headphones or earbuds.

The game constantly gives you incentive to play, by introducing gifts for completing certain tasks. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a very long time. And again, I cannot believe it is on a portable system. The city is huge, the visuals crisp and colorful... I cannot say enough good things about this game. It is well worth the $20 and even worth 40. There is a lot to see and do and you will enjoy every mile marker along the way.

The MotionPlus controls are great, and add a lot to the gameplay; certain parts require you to slash and cut your sword at exact angles. The graphics aren't great, but definitely push the Wii to its limits. All of the colors pop out on screen and look beautiful. The audio throughout the game is impressive as well; everything has been orchestrated by the Hylian Orchestra. The story is huge, as are the levels and side quests. If you have any interest at all in the Zelda video games, definitely get this game!",Epic Zelda game!
B000ZK7ZOE,5.0,"As I mentioned in my review for Prototype, this game (Infamous) has little in common with the other aside from you controlling a guy with new superpowers in a fully explorable and quarantined city killing bad guys. This game opens in the fictional Empire City as it suffers from an enormous explosion that almost completely levels one of the city's three islands. After the explosion, bike messenger Cole MacGrath awakens in the center of the explosion's blast crater and soon finds that he has been endowed with the ability to channel electricity and use it to fry his enemies. As he grows accustomed to his powers, life in Empire City starts going down the tubes: the government has quarantined the city due to some kind of plague that seems to be driving people mad, gangs have divided up and taken control over all three of the city's islands, most of the police have either been killed or are hiding out in fear, and everyone else is struggling to survive in this modern day wild west. Cole has the power to change things for the better, bringing hope and peace back to the city... or he could simply make things better for himself and ignore the needs of others. Regardless of what road he chooses, Cole will undergo many missions in order to find a mysterious device called the Ray Sphere, which is what caused the explosion and gave Cole his electric powers. These missions will involve Cole restoring power to the different sections of the city, taking out the gangs/police patrolling the streets, and a couple missions where you protect a friendly target from enemies. There are also many side missions where you destroy reinforced buses armed with machine guns that attack the city, track down hidden enemies, follow enemy messengers without being spotted to a drop off, put a stop to gang wars, and much more. Similarly to Spider-Man 2, Cole can access these missions by approaching citizens who call out to him. Cole has a karma meter that will go up after good acts or down after evil acts.

He soon gains three electric abilities that he can perform on wounded enemies and civilians; he can restrain, heal, or drain them of their bioelectric energy (bioleech). Healing civilians grants him positive karma points, while restraining civilians and using bioleach on civilians or even enemies gives him negative karma points. Killing civilians and police also of course gives Cole negative karma. This can be a pain for those who want to be good guys since the civilians tend to sometimes run straight into the middle of a shootout between Cole and his enemies and get themselves killed. At least those who want to be bad don't have to worry about collateral damage, they can go nuts. There are also some good and evil side missions which grant further positive and negative karma points respectively. Cole can work for justice and do things like herd prisoners to a police station, join the police on raids against gangs, and capture enemies without killing them; or he can be a bad boy and herd captured gang members to a group of rival gang members for execution, join gang members on attacks against the police, and assassinate people. There are also many set-pieces and random encounters where Cole will be faced with a moral dilemma and must choose to either make the right or selfish decision, and these choices give you the largest amounts of karma points. The game kind of goes into freeze frame mode while Cole weighs the pros and cons of his two possible choices. Most of these ""moral dilemmas"" are pretty black and white, making it obvious which decision you should make if you know whether you want to be good or bad. For example, when faced by a guy who's barring your progress through a door because he's worried about his wife, you have to decide whether to tell him that his wife was killed or you can simply zap your way through the door and the guy himself. There is one moral dilemma during the last quarter of the game that will give you pause and make you actually think about which decision you should make, so more of the other moral choices should have been like that.

Now for the good stuff, Cole's powers and abilities. He starts out with a regular electric zapping attack called the Lightning Bolt that allows him to shoot at enemies from an over-the-shoulder perspective at a distance, as well as an Electromagnetic Shockwave where Cole shoots out a short-range wave of electrical energy that could blow enemies or even cars back. During the missions where he goes through the sewers to restore power to sections of the city, Cole will acquire new electric abilities such as Shock Grenades, Megawatt Hammers (balls of electricity fired like missiles), Precision (a more powerful, long-range lightning bolt), and Lightning Storm (I'll let you see that one for yourselves). Most of these powers and other abilities can be upgraded through the EXP Cole earns by completing missions and defeating enemies. There are a couple of other electric powers Cole acquires that depend on whether he's good or evil, although more wide-range area-of-affect electric attacks would have been nice. He can even beat up enemies with electrically charged melee attacks, mostly punches and flip kicks, but you'll be using his ranged attacks a lot more than his melee ones. All of Cole's ranged attacks, as well as one specialized melee attack, use up power nodes from Cole's energy meter, except the Lightning Bolt which has infinite ""ammo"". Cole can increase his energy meter after collecting a certain number of Blast Shards which are scattered all over the city.

There's no visible health meter, but as Cole receives damage the sides of the screen get splattered with blood and everything goes black and white with lowered sound as Cole is near death. His health will regenerate if he keeps himself from suffering further damage, but absorbing electricity from power sources like light poles and generators will not only regenerate his health, but also refill his energy meter. Plus, make sure to keep Cole out of the water, for obvious reasons. Small puddles won't hurt him, but waist deep water is less than healthy for the guy. Cole also specializes in parkour/urban exploring, so he can jump across light poles, powerlines, and rooftops. He's also very adept at climbing up and down buildings by grabbing onto window sills, pipes, railings, and other available handholds; in fact, he's a little too good at grabbing these things and sometimes has trouble simply letting go of these handholds and standing flat on a rooftop. Despite his gifted climbing skills, Cole can't climb up chain link fences, which simply doesn't make sense. Later on, he'll be able to travel through the city more fluidly by gaining the ability to use his electricity to grind along train tracks and powerlines, as well as use Static Thrusters to glide over slightly longer distances. Somehow, Cole's electric powers allow him to survive drops from very high buildings; it's convenient, but confusing.

The game's combat is a bit repetitive, but still fun and challenging. The three islands of Empire City have been taken over by three gangs: former drug dealers in red hoodies who have been mutated into Reapers, homeless people who encased themselves in trash armor to become the Dust Men, and the secret organization with ties to the Ray Sphere called the First Sons. Most of the guys in these groups shoot at you with assault rifles (and incredible aim), but they also have their own guys who were affected by the Ray Sphere and have their own powers like telekinesis, invisibility, and smaller scaled electric powers. Aside from the Blast Shards, Cole can also track down and collect Dead Drops left behind by an undercover agent who infiltrated the First Sons, which are all audio recordings that reveal interesting background information. The story is also told through many in-game cutscenes and several comic book themed cutscenes between chapters that look like they were pulled right out of a comic book. These scenes give the game a nice look, as well as a cool storytelling element when Cole narrates them.

The cutscenes change somewhat depending on whether you're good or evil, but not too greatly; the more noticeable differences between being good or bad are reflected through the way the city changes along with Cole. If Cole is good, the city begins to appear more well put together, posters are put up depicting Cole as a hero, citizens cheer for and praise the hero, and Cole himself looks just like the way he does on the game's cover. If Cole is evil, the city remains a dump, posters are put up showing how ""infamous"" Cole is, citizens will cower in fear or attack the villain, and Cole appears more grimy and pale... and uses cool looking red lightning. The game's graphics are pretty nice. While Empire City doesn't vary too greatly in design, it's still modeled well with its many buildings and tree-filled parks. The characters also have good designs, especially Cole and the main villains, of which there are three and they serve as the game's entertaining boss fights. Aside from the somewhat repetitive combat and a couple of movement glitches here and there, this game has a lot going for it: a good story, interesting characters and enemies, cool powers, nice graphics, and tight controls. If you want to take part in the origin story of the latest superhero/supervillain, then I suggest buying or at the very least renting this game. Totally worth it.",Use your superpowers to become a savior or a destroyer

B0000AI1KK,5.0,"Fatal Frame series have been evolutionized to a new level compared to other survival horror series like Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The sequel messes up your entire being like no other. It comes as no surprise, as the Fatal Frame series shies away from stereotypical Western imaginery of Romero films, and novels from H.P Lovecraft and Clive Barker. It's main inspiration are from Japanese urban legends and folklores.
In Fatal Frame 2, CGs have black and white reel features with noise grains, I think inspired from Ringu or The Ring movies. The psychological horror is also strongly reminiscent of Ju-On series, where at times it is too dark to see anything, and spirits appear out of extraordinary in their own bizarre way. Spirits might creep out of closets, from above, below, or simply drop down like a mangled corpse. If you think Nemesis of Resident Evil is frightening, wait until you encounter Falling Woman or girl in Crimson Kimono.
Fatal Frame 2 also does more item fetching and backtracking more feverishly than other games I know of. While in other games, it is tedious and monotonous, it becomes a hellish experience to venture back and forth into familiar places because there are spirits that you dread to meet again and you'll never know what you'll meet. At times, you're stuck and nowhere to go and you venture around keep looking for clues while paranoid of freaky spirits.
Graphically-wise, Fatal Frame 2 is stunning. No aliasing glitches, stunning wall textures, and simply too many things to admire in beauty. Some spirits give out trembling aura, and you see tripply motion blur. These blurs lag the game sometimes when two or three spirits surround you. The passage to the caves and shrine is hauntingly beautiful if you look at the trees, these are simply stunning moments of Fatal Frame 2. Soundwise, there are occational hiccups where some voice acting are laughable and at other times it sends shiver down your spines. Replay value is quite good, with missions to unlock and costumes to be unlocked after completing each difficulty from normal to nightmare modes. Hard and Nightmare modes can only be unlocked after completing Normal mode.
Best played in the dark with surround on, because I know no other game that can give you a much surreal experience than that...except maybe Eternal Darkness.",Fatal Frame 2 is a health hazard. Be warned.

The game is not as good as other shooters I have played. The graphics and the story were not great. It is the split-screen co-op offline campaign mode that makes the game.

B009AGXH64,5.0,"Well, they sure took their time, but it finally came. Nintendo games in HD. Yeah, they were the last to the party, but when it comes to Nintendo does that even matter? After 30 years of the same characters, the same plots and essentially the same games re-made time and time again, Nintendo's games have still managed to outsell both PlayStation and Xbox combined.

I love my classic Nintendo characters, and being able to play them in High Definition is really easy on the eyes. Because most of these games (Mario Bros, Donkey Kong etc.) don't rely on intense visuals like many PlayStation and Xbox games, the characters look perfectly rendered. The Wii U, which I still think is kind of a dumb name, features it's variety of games with the potential to perform at 1080p and 60 fps. While there technically aren't any Wii U specific controllers the new console has implemented the Gamepad, which I think is unique and effective. The Gamepad provides a great 5th player experience and is used in a variety of neat ways.

One of the things Nintendo has done better than anyone else is allow the use of backwards compatibility to the fullest extent. The Wii U is the only next-gen console able to use discs from it's previous console (the Wii). In addition, many of the past Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo and NES games are also available on the Nintendo Store. Like it's prior incarnation, the interface on the Wii U is very similar to the Wii, the difference mainly being that it's much sharper. Also like the Wii there is no Blu-Ray drive, but there are video apps such as Netflix that do support other HD video playback.

When it comes to a Nintendo console, the Wii U offers pretty much everything you could ask for in a Nintendo gaming machine.","Your Favorite Nintendo Characters in HD, Finally"

The game now features 11 difficulty levels, better legendary items, Paragon Leveling from 1-100 (upon reaching Level 60) with MF and GF stats rewards, an over-arching Uber Boss quest so that you can forge the most-sought-after Hellfire Ring, and improved & balanced skills.

B0000507UR,5.0,"This is indeed the best adventure game I have played in a long time. There are not many games out there on the market in the pure adventure genre, but THE LONGEST JOURNEY is definately a great game with a great storyline!
If you don't know, THE LONGEST JOURNEY is about a young woman named April who lives in America in a near-distant future. April is an artist, hoping to get a grant by a local school for admission. But lately April is troubled by her dreams and telling you anymore would be unfair. This storyline is utterly engrossing. It is like watching a long, but really great movie. Plus, I was captivated by the graphics of the game as well.
The puzzles range from really easy to moderately difficult. Seasoned adventure gamers should not have a problem. All of the puzzles have a logical solution to them. There are not to many games out there right now that require you to stop and think: How do I make this work?
All in all, this is one of the best games of any genre that I have ever played and that is the truth. If you are a fan of MYST, ALONE IN THE DARK, MONKEY ISLAND and maybe TOMB RAIDER, you'll fall in love with THE LONGEST JOURNEY! Trust me, I cannot reccomend this game enough. It was worth every penny.",Best adventure game in a long time

I decided to install the PC version just for nostalgia mostly, but then i saw that the PC version has quite a bit of redeeming qualities. The modding comunity is still strong when it comes to this game, there is a graphics enhancer, you can install a trainer and let your suspension of disbelief take over for awhile.

1. This thing is heavy. If you drop it it may cause serious injury
2. This thing is big. Even though this is a toy, it makes feel the others like toys
3. You need to put some muscle into moving it. If you have not tried it yet, you will notice a huge difference with what you may be used to by now. I did not find stickiness (though I have not tested every single one that has came out of the factory), but may be that what other people call stickiness is part of its size and the force you have to use to move this. Even so, once you pass the surprise, this is what becomes natural, and the others feel like plastic sticks (though they are)

The movement is quite fluid and precise",pleasant surprise
B00140P9BA,5.0,"From reading the reviews of other players, I was trepidatious in my resolve to purchase the game for myself. Although every gaming site out there ranked it with at least 9/10 stars, the customer reviews were significantly lower, and for reasons which seemed vague and nebulous. ""Released too soon!"" and ""Don't support EA making garbage games!"" are comments I heard bantered about, but didn't lend themselves to any sort of clear understanding as to the game's shortcomings. Well, for father's day, I purchased the game, with the subtle intent of watching my father play it and thereby discover its merits.

His computer is a brand new, fully loaded Vista 64-bit machine with an 8800 GTX Ultra video card and a Q6600 processor clocked to 2.6ghz. A fairly respectable system, by any estimation. We installed the game and had no trouble whatsoever from the moment the disk was inserted. I have then purchased the game, and installed it on my four year old system, running a 3.2ghz dual core Intel processor, and an 8800 512mb GT superclocked graphics card. The game is flawless, aside from a somewhat considerable load time after opening the game. I also have the graphics set to maximum, and have a beautiful, lag free frame rate.

To give this game a reference point, I might call it the counterpart to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, set in space. NPCs abound in the world to interact with, and give you various side missions and 'quests' that you can pursue or not at your leisure, and will reward you with credits and experience, or sometimes rare items. A typical fare for the RPG game.

The dialogue is phenomenal, complimented with voice acting from Marina Sirtis of Star Trek: The Next Generation and Seth Green of, well, quite a few things, and is on par with any CG animated movie I've yet seen. This begs commentary on the graphics, which are also superb. The transition between cut-scenes and real time action is smooth and natural, and utilizes sophisticated camera angles and panning which mimic Hollywood productions. Lip movement, character expressions--from the furrowing of eyebrows when in consternation to wide-eyed expressions of shock or horror, to a nearly imperceptible twist in the lips indicating a smirk or bemusement--are incredibly life like. It is a pleasure to sit and watch the characters interact, and this is a good thing for there is a great portion of the game built into NPC conversations.

The storyline is not entirely innovative, involving the usual super villain who is maniacally bent upon enslaving the universe. However, the manner in which it is delivered is simply delightful, and kept me playing well into the night repeating to myself, 'Just one more mission, then I'll call it quits.' That's the mark of an excellent game, in my humble estimation.

As one reviewer remarked, the story was written by a well established science fiction author, and from these auspicious roots a tree has sprung, bearing a multitude of delicious fruits. Each encounter with NPCs provides the player with the opportunity to determine to some extent the outcome of the situation, directing it towards results which are either positive or negative in their greater effects. Without spoiling the ending, I may say that a significant decision is made available to the player which determines the ultimate outcome of the game, leading to the possibility of four different conclusions. The game creates a sort of binary opposition in character choices, a Manichean dualism of the 'dark side' versus the 'light side', giving your character points in either category. Occasionally, the outcomes of your decisions are the same no matter which option you have chosen, but they usually effect some change.

A point which I found particularly rewarding was the perceptive inclusion of intelligent conversation choices for your character, and the relevant,  penetrating responses given by the other characters. In confusing situations where new topics are broached or complicated or illusive concepts are being discussed, the options for dialogue are usually exactly the sort of questions I find myself thinking as I'm listening to the conversations. On even the most obscure or trivial of topics, I was able to find a dialogue branch which asked the question I had, or made the comment I was thinking. It was remarkable how intuitive and well formulated the entire system was, and is a wonderful reflection of the meticulously crafted nature of the whole game.

If there is a downside, it is the not insignificant time you will be spending in elevators. Waiting. On nearly every planet or map that you visit, you will be confronted with at least one elevator, which may sometimes be in transit for upwards of a minute. It's a small annoyance, but one that is difficult to forget. The game's designers seem to have been aware of this and attempted to compensate by including unique dialogue between your squad mates while you're in the elevator, or broadcasting reports about your previous missions over the intercom. Infrequently, you can even pick up a mission just by listening to the intercom in the elevator, which only seems reasonable as you need to listen to SOMETHING while you're in there. Waiting.

Learning the game can also be a bit of a trick to begin with, incorporating manifold layers of skills and equipment upgrades. The initial temptation to allow the game to auto level your character can be strong, governed by the overwhelming nature of the game's rigorous detail. However, once you have managed to understand the cause and effect of your actions, leveling your character and choosing their weapons and upgrades becomes a large part of the fun, and one you will miss if you let the game choose for you.

This is a game that is soundly composed, and comprises a world that is really a great deal of fun to explore. Nothing ever seems irrelevant or menial, which is a relief after playing even games like Oblivion, where each Ayleid ruin and cavern become a monotonous mold of the previous. Whether travelling at faster than light speeds between solar systems to explore new planets, fighting a myriad of interesting and artfully created aliens, or simply interacting with the multitude of colourful NPCs you will encounter around the universe, Mass Effect is a story that brings some much needed grandeur back into the world of gaming.

As for the 3 time install limit? Honestly, 1 is enough, because you'll never take it off your system.",Misunderestimated
B01AC3ZE46,5.0,"In short, I just finished Bayonetta 2, and YES, I do feel it's better than the first in many ways!

-----Good Changes:-----
The first threw in a bunch of pointless little non-combat obstacles, they were very repetitive, and only kept you from progressing, and added no value to the game.

In this game, they're all but removed! making the game feel much more consistent. You spend more time fighting, and less mashing the attack button on doors and dodging lighting just to simply enter the next room.

You get some fun new weapons this time around, and some older ones have been changed. I now find myself using a much wider selection of gear when compared to the first game.

Angle attack mini game is removed. if it was optional in the first game it would have been fine,
But but it was a forced waste of time.

Combat feels much more smooth!
I don't know what they did, but it's a noticeable change for the better.

Finally has co-op fights!
Online only, but still very cool.
--------------------------------------
But it's not all good.
There are some very poor changes as well
--------------------------------------------------------

---The BAD Changes:---

1. Significantly easier
I don't know if it's a re-balance of the difficulties, but this game is significantly easier than the first. (I played on normal)

2. Significantly weaker story.
While Bayonetta 1 was not know for a groundbreaking story or anything, it was simple enough, unintrusive, and fairly easy to follow.
This one is a mess, and even in the final battle, the forms are broken up buy chunks of random drops of deus ex machina.
Very little is explained (in the main story) and characters show up and leave whenever it's convenient.

While it did by no means ruin the game, it was a bit distracting.

3. Weak end game, The last few hours of the game did some some exciting fights, but most of them were less exciting, (and easier) than ones halfway through the game.

4. Completely forgettable Final battle. no spoilers, but it came no where near the difficulty, complexity, size, or scope of the final fight from the first game.

----------------------

---Conclusion--

If you could not tell, I REALLY enjoyed Bayonetta 1, I easily could give that game a 5/5, but it was not perfect.
Neither is this game.

It improves in many area  that actually make it more fun to play!
Dose that make it the better overall game?

I really can't say.

Overall I'd say I enjoyed Bayonetta 1 overall better as a full package, mainly for the crazy end game, and way more over the top moments in both story and gameplay.

But, I'd be much more likely to replay Bayonetta 2, it's more streamlined, and it's much easier to pick up and play and get right into a fight!","Better then the original in many ways, but bit lacking in others"
B015NGZFWS,5.0,"I got it for the obvious reason that it came with Black ops 3 and it's the very first 1TB ps4 they've released. That being said; I at first didn't really care for the design from what I was seeing in pictures, I thought that the previous edition (Advanced Warfare) Xbox One design was a lot nicer. I received the package Friday and I actually really like the way this console looks. It's has an all mat finish so the shiny hard drive cover that gets scratched up and finger printed easily is gone and the console is much better off with out it. The controller is definitely cool, I like the design. The blu Ray drive is definitely different from the 1st edition ps4 (this is my 2nd unit for multi screen play) but it doesn't seem to be anything more than a noticeable noise difference when inserting a disc. Out of the box it is running super QUIET, a blessing IMO. We really than this thing hard from 11/6/15-11/8/15. Honestly all day gaming, maybe 10-12 hours a day and it was quiet the whole time. My first edition was running a bit load. (Note each console is sitting out in the open free of inner spaces) The campaign, zombies, multiplayer are all a blast and 4 player coop is when it's at its best. the game game offer so much, even unlocking a new mode NIGHTMARE which is a crazy zombie campaign you get after completing the main campaign (which is fantastic when playing with friends). The console is great, it's a ps4, its black ops 3, and it's the only 1TB HD on the market currently. So far so good :-)",Bought from Amazon

B00XID02H2,5.0,"Rainbow Six - oh how I've missed you.  One of my greatest loves when it came to Xbox 360 games was Rainbow Six Vegas.  I loved, loved, loved, loved that game.  Did I say I loved it?  I mean, yeah, I really loved it.  I played through the single player mode completely before ever playing any multiplayer mode in that game and then cursed myself for missing out on the sheer joy that was available in the multiplayer modes that I could have been playing while taking my own sweet time getting through the single player mode.  That game looked beautiful (for that time/era), played wonderfully and yet was appropriately challenging (just right, not too tough, not too easy) and required skill and tactical game play.  Running and gunning (as you would find in those Call of.... games) wouldn't work in Rainbow Six, though that is also perhaps one of the games biggest drawbacks as so many people seem to prefer that game style.

Siege is something that I've been waiting impatiently for, ever since I first got a sniff or a hint that the game was coming out for the current ""next generation"" systems.  It brings back that familiar game play (though as I noted to friends today, it reminds me of just how rusty I am at it since I avoided the beta release because I didn't want to spoil the game for when it was finally released) and familiar game modes while bringing in improved graphics and performance from the Xbox One console's hardware.  While I will still wind up putting Star Wars Battlefront back into the console for several more hours of game play, I'm also going to wind up playing hours and days worth of Siege in the coming days and weeks.  It truly is a great time to be an owner of either an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4, given these great games. :-}",Rainbow Six - oh how I've missed you.

B01AZC3III,5.0,"Picking up the controller for the first time, it feels a lot like an Xbox One controller.  That's a good thing, that means it's solid, comfortable and everything is roughly where it should be.  All the triggers and buttons you would expect are there.  Easily hooks up to iPhone/Ipad using bluetooth, and it will prompt you to install the nimbus app.  The Nimbus app doesn't really do much, although it will let you find compatible games, and will let you install firmware updates (when I got it, it was updated all the way already).

Has an indicator on it to show which controller it is that it paired (1 through 4).  It has a lightning port on it for charging which is great if you're already using an iOS device (or like the new Apple TV which the remote already charges via lightning).

The Wii Motion Plus attachment dongle was annoying to remove and put on plus it made the controller much bigger which was annoying.

One tip I would give is to buy this right when you buy the N3DS unit (or maybe before) so you can put it on right away and do not have to worry about cleaning the screens thoroughly beforehand. Just one less thing to worry about!

B000084318,5.0,"This is the greatest Zelda game EVER!It is superior to almost every Zelda game before it(excluding Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past)The graphics are beautiful and cool.

Along the way he meets a talking boat,a gang of pirates,and even Princess Zelda. He also searches for a long lost treasure and discovers a land beneath the sea. I loved the dungeons and the bosses[especially the giant worm].And I adored sailing in the game. But this game is not perfect. For one thing the enemies aren't hard. And sailing gets tedious(towards the end anyway).Plus the final boss is way too easy(although he is a wicked cool boss ).But you forget about all that once you face the challenge of the game.

B000FW6MFK,5.0,"You'll notice all the lesser reviews are by people with 360s, which is like downrating Las Vegas as a tourist destination because your airport doesn't provide a direct flight.

As for the game itself: DESTROY ALL HUMANS 2 gets right everything that the first game did not -- first by killing ""Pox"", an unnecessary and annoying character, then by improving all the controls and processes. In a few short missions you'll have all your basic tools, and upgrading is easy & intuitive. Side missions are interesting, setting is fantastically thought out, and character interaction keeps things lively.

Admittedly, there could be a wider variety of character templates, but this is compensated by all the gags & commentary embedded in people's thoughts; dozens of cultural references give a surprising depth.

I haven't tried the 2P  options yet, but my son is itching to find out. I liked it enough to get the first DAH so I could have more, and was disappointed at how clunky & underdeveloped the first game was by comparison -- I'd rather come back to DAH2, a game which really feels like you're flying a saucer, saving humanity & running around with a ray gun [but not in that order].

Cons:

As you can see I enjoy the game a lot. Lots of diverse things to do: missions, side missions, pickup gear/weapons, dark zone exploring, co-op action, and I meet a lot of good people. There is one draw back though if you're considering buying the PC version. Unfortunately there are many players that are using cheats in this version of the game. For example, there are cheats to shoot all the ammo out of your magazine with one shot. There are cheats that people use to see through walls. And just another cheat I've seen is they can teleport to anywhere in the Dark Zone. Now I know it sounds bad but honestly the pros outweigh the cons. When I get killed by a cheater I just switch servers or go back to single player action or I keep going back to the cheater and let them kill me while I record it over and over and over. If that's not fun anymore I hook up with 3 other players and do missions. Like I said before I've met a lot of good people on this game and roaming with them in the Dark Zone is fun.

You start on a space ship and work your way onto a planet Ragol and discover the truth of the people on Pioneer 1 are no more. The story has little focus on the actual gameplay. You can have optional quest to do easy objectives like find someone or so on to gain money(Mesta).The fun of the game is the multiplayer or online.eaither way you have 4 people you can play with at a time. You and your friends can team up hit off to Ragol and start killing of the inhabitants wich are threatning you. Online you are offered weapons and gear that are not obtainable offline. It is very addicting collecting and upgrading weapons to their own potential. Or to find a rare weapon thta everyone wants including yourself. When you level up you can brag to all your friends then wait till they die and take their cash. You can heal your friends i nbattles or be jerks to them if you're stronger and let them die off and you take all the goods you want. So many people can't put this game down. Wit hall the arrangments of guns,swords,sabes,daggers,rifles,wands,magical spells,and shields you can obtai nit makes it endless. Each location on the planet hasa theme liek a forest,cave,mine,ruin and so on. The bosses are rugged and tough and rewuire team work. You can raise little robots (mags) and they become ike your own helper but you must train them and feed them in order to do so. Whats really nice is the fact that you get episode 2 along with episode 1. Thats a one-up fro mthe Dreamcast version. Now when you're done episode one you can take your gaming exsperience further and go through countless hours of more extravagent roaming of\ver lush envirements like seabeds. The enemies for the most part are appropriate if it's the forest the enemies go along with the envirement. I will say the AI is a little lacking but it's all to fun to find doubts on why not to play it. The controls are easy to get the hang of and soon you'll be a pro at timing shots and getting good accuracy. Buy this and go home happy.",Halo Has Some Competition

B00IPTUJ8G,5.0,"I was very skeptical of what I read about this being a great port, I own this on the PC and played on PS3.
Love this franchise.

This port to the Vita is amazing. Sure there are some differences like graphics - but this is a portable system and the graphics are amazing on this port. The game stays true to the original in game play and story. There seem to be less enemies per map though, understandably.

The guns and gore are still there and their sense of humor, o the sense of humor.

If you were a fan of the console or PC version, or even if you haven't tried this game out yet - for $20 (which nets you 6 DLCs along with the original game) - you can't go wrong.

Definitely made a believer out of me",Amazing port of a stellar game
B000GPVUOY,5.0,"What you have here is an amazing game that never gets any fanfare. In stranglehold, you are tossed into the shoes of Chow yun Fat and then you use those shoes to kick all sorts of ass. Many games have tried to mimic John woo's style but none of them really bring you into his signature stylish gunplay quite like this. The action in this game is constant and designed in such a way that you rarely ever get a moment to settle down and that's the point.

 So how is this game different than all the rest? Well, for one, you have tequila bombs which act like little power boosts when your meter fills up. You have one that's similar to a health pack, the second is precision aiming which follows the bullet right to the bad guys, barrage which is about twenty seconds of invulnerability, and the final ability lets you spin in a circle shooting everything in sight while doves soar above you. All of these powers are useful in different situations and are essential to finishing the game.

  Oh, and that's not all. Most of the environment is interactive, you can slide down banisters and glide across tables while you blast everything in your path. Believe me, everything in this game is either destructable or useable and once you get the hang of the relativley simple controls, you'll swear this is the closest you've ever come to being in an action movie.

  If you've never heard of this or you really want to get your adrenaline pumping, give this a shot. The cinematic shoot outs are awesome to behold and this thing is lying around in just about any bargain bin. My only complaint is that this game is pretty short and some of the graphics seem kinda plain, but don't let these qualms keep you from missing this trip through Tokyo.",Way Underrated.
B00004WGVY,5.0,I have played this game three times.  It has a great story and is one of the most fun computer games i've played.  The graphics may be a bit outdated now but don't let that deter you.

This is the best quality headset I have ever used at this price-point. The USB cable is long and durably constructed. The headset itself is extremely comfortable to wear (and I have a fairly large head). The 7.1 sound has been excellent in every game I've tried it with, and it functions well with the Asus Sound Radar app. I also own a Turtle Beach gaming headset and while I find the audio quality to be comparable, I find the Corsair Vengeance to be a lot more comfortable to wear for any significant length of time.",Great Value and Great Sound

-Brings the Zelda franchise forward like no other franchise so far by bringing a demanding combat system unlike before and survival mechanics that transform the way you explore the world.
-Challenging and rewarding gameplay at every second, joined by a huge wealth mysteries and discoveries that last well beyond the main quest.
-Gorgeous graphics although limited by the hardware.

B00E4MQODC,5.0,"I upgraded to this mouse from a Logitech G500 (and a Logitech G5 before that, and a Logitech MX518 before that) and it's easily my favorite mouse of all time.

Pros:
First of all, there's virtually zero noticeable lag and for a wireless mouse, that was a huge performance concern for me. Other than that, it performs about the same as my Logitech G500, but has significantly more thumb buttons. The Logitech Gaming software allows you to bind any of the 6 thumb buttons to keyboard functions, which is a great boon for gaming. Other mouses with thumb buttons would be detected as Mouse 4, 5, 6, etc., but would not be detected or mappable in some games. By allowing us to map these buttons to keyboard buttons, it basically ensures these buttons are ALWAYS available for mapping in pretty much every PC game. For example, in my use-case I'm a WASD gamer, so I'll map the G4 -G9 thumb buttons as keyboard buttons JKLIOP. Battery life is supposedly 250 hours, and I believe it. I use my PC daily for 1-4 hours at least, and I've been on the same pair of AA batteries since May 2015. It has a switch for performance and power savings; I don't really notice the difference between the two, so I always leave it in power saving. As of course, it has 3 adjustable DPI settings so you can adjust your mouse sensitive on the fly.

Cons:
The only thing I lost in my upgrade from the G500 was modular weights, but I really don't miss it. That's it for cons!

TL;DR
If you're considering a wireless gaming mouse, look no further.","If you're considering a wireless gaming mouse, look no further"
B001TOQ8X4,5.0,"This game is the best game i have ever played in my adult life.  Better than WoW during burning crusade.  Better than every other joker mmorpg WoW clone that has come out just about every week since 2004.  Better than every single xbox joke and ps3 joke game (although ps3 was good and much better than xbox, xbox is a full fledged joke).  This game brings back all the little things that go unnoticed to most... but absolutely loved and immortalized in the memories of true gamers, adventure lovers, story appreciators, and generally sensible people.  The soundtrack is AMAZING too.  Not once during my entire MMO career (which started with WoW) have I listened to the game soundtrack.  I've always had a media player open.  When I play this game, I get tempted to buy the soundtrack (in order to further support the game) and listen to it in my car, or while I do other things on the computer.  Buy this game immediately.  If you already reviewed this game, and gave it anything less than 5 stars, i honestly don't think you should play video games anymore because you clearly don't understand what makes them so great.  This game defines what makes video games great.  Hats off to the developers.  Cheers.",Get reminded why you love videos games... and then discover countless new reasons!
B00005RZJA,5.0,"Honestly, I was totally turned off by the beta demo that was originally released online.  Choppy gameplay, unclear specialist roles, uninspired graphics.  Then, in a momentary lapse of my faculties, I bought the retail version.  Applied the latest patches, and was again underwhelmed.
The bot AI in single player seemed to be based on a weird logic where you teammates rush into the meat grinder while the bad guys stand and fire like pop-up targets (and manage to take you out 1/4 way cross the map with a shotgun).  The tutorials don't offer much insight into how the various specialist classes (medic, heavy gunner, commando, recon, sniper, demolitions) function.
That said, I think it's this specialist system that ultimately won me over.  Each specialist has a specific set of weapons that he can purchase (i.e., only the sniper can purchase the larger scoped weapons, demo guy is the only one who can buy the grenade launcher, etc.), as well as a particular skill that can be crucial in your team's success (or failure).
The recon has a lifesign detector (think of the gadget at the end of 'Rainbow Six' - the book) that can identify bogies at great distances.  However, the detector runs has a short battery life, and you have to be near your teammates for them to use this information.  The medic can heal or revive teammates.  The demo guy can set remotely detonated charges (and can turn parked cars into map-clearing bombs).
The mechanics of the game really emphasize team cooperation.  Yeah, you could have a squad of ""elite"" shooters steamroller their way to victory, but you could also have a recon sneak the VIP under the noses of the opposition to win the round.  Of course, this assumes that the bunch of strangers that you find online are looking to play this game in a team-friendly way.  For now, I think most of the players recognize this and play accordingly, and I think that's what makes GlobOps such an entertaining (and challenging) experience.",This game grows on you...

B00020V4NK,5.0,"I'm not going to cover what's already been covered several times in other reviews.  But I will say that to make this game complete you really need NCAA Football 2005.  Why?  After you finish a season in Madden 2005 the Xbox generates names and stats automatically.  Wouldn't it be more realistic if those stats were earned?  Buy NCAA Football 2005, play a season, import the roster and draft players with real stats at the end of a season on Madden 2005.  Repeate after every season you play. Now of course I realize that none of this is real, but I just somehow feel better drafting players that earn their stats instead of letting the Xbox create them.  In NCAA Football 2005 your players start nameless, but when you recruit after the season your new players will have names.  When they complete their college career, you can change their names.  What I did is I took my senior class and drafted some of them -- I couldn't get all I wanted -- and named them Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, Arthur Fonzerilli, and Potsie Webber.  That way when I see them on the field the backs of their jerseys will have a name instead of FB#5.  ESPN NFL 2K5 can't compete with this game.

B001C2RMJM,5.0,"My wife loves the slot machines and lucky for me I can cool some of her interest with these video games for the PC.  Several manufacturers write casino games and slot machine games but Phantom EFX is one of the best.  My wife liked this game disk as it had a lot of pretty good video slot machines and several of them have cute video bonus rounds that she just loves to play.

This disk had a pirate's boat with 3 deck levels full of video slots.  Her favorite games were Blackbeard's Pirate Game Show, Phantom Babies, Bugs, and Cheddar Chase. Some of the slot machines have bonus rounds with high graphic video action that is very entertaining.  Features like pick a door or have a pirate walk the plank were cute. One of her favorites was the ability to complete the maps and buy prize vault items and once you complete the prize vaults and map you can unlock new slot machines.

I fell in love with this game all over again.

I found myself doing many things in this version that I never did in the ps2 version.

Raced Chocobo's for hours to get Tidus weapon.
Auron was pretty simple. That was my team of three throughout most of the game.
And played the Monster Arena LOTS.
Got all the available summoning for Yuna and her celestial weapon also
Like hell I'm dodging 200 bolts of effing lighting though! FORGET IT!!!

After getting the celestial weapons for those 4 characters and leveling the hell out of them. The main story line was painfully easy.. I MURDERED the final boss in a few minutes.. haha.

UT fulfilled all the requirements perfectly.

Actual gameplay is a blast. Weapons are well balanced and suited to almost anyone's style of combat- from the close-quarters effectiveness of the Enforcers to the long-range sniper rifle.
Defualt keyboard controls are well thought out and easy to learn, altough the stock joystick layout leaves much to be deisred.

B0013RATNM,5.0,"The Original Just Cause was a Great ""Fresh"" Concept to the Sandbox/Open World Genre
But, It wasn't Polished had many Glitches, Problems That made it No Fun in the Over-All Landscape

After reading the Great Review in Game Informer Mag. I was extremely Intrigued.
Picked it up and I'm hooked!!!!!
I have no clue how the Studio was able 2 get a Sequel up and made
But, This is What The Just Cause Concept was meant to be
Both THQ and Rockstar Studio need 2 take notice The Landscape has Changed!
@ This Date and Time This is The Ultimate Sandbox Game That has Raised The Bar
Even if you never Played The Original Just Cause playing the Sequel is like riding a Bike once u get the hang of it you have it
@ The same time if you never Played the 1st Game u might Not understand why JC 2 is such a Huge Step Forward
I've put in 30hrs and have Barley Scratched the surface

Just Cause 2 is without a Doubt Epic (Bigger then any other Sandbox Title so far)  and flat out fun so easy to get sucked into
The Game has been re-worked from the ground up The Gun Play is  spot on, Everything can be up Upgraded
U can shoot  Cluster Grenades into the Ocean/Water and see The Aftermath!
 The driving has a much better feel then the Original
The New Grappling-Hook  adds so much to how u can play the game along with attaching Various Items 2 each other
When things Blow up They really Blow up!!!!!
The havok physics engine has been used IMO the Best so Far in any Sandbox Game
The 5.1 Audio is Really good (The Detail in the audio is amazing to say the least)
The only area it Suffers is The Story (Don't expect Bio Shock, Assassin's Creed or Mass Effect type Story Telling)
But, It doesn't Matter it's like alot of the Action Flicks of the 1980's Plenty of Action, More Guns, Over The Top Violence But, unlike a Film you are the one Directing all the action............
Everyone  involved in Getting this game made should feel extremely Proud
Eidos, Avalanche,  & Square Enix have made a Amazing Free Roaming acting title
It's One of the best Action Sandbox Games I've played for the 360

If you take Crackdown, Saints Row, GTA, Mercenaries 2,  and Bionic Commando and mix them all up you'll get Just Cause 2

Hopefully this title gains Major word of mouth and gets Plenty of Attention.

B00IMVRVC4,5.0,"This is one of the first games I picked up for my new PS4 system, and it's like a glorified version of one of those goofy Android app games that you just cannot put down.

I love it because anybody can pretty much learn all of the main controls in a few minutes, but the devil is in mastering those controls.

It's also cool that so far, the courses have not been overly long, yet they have multiple check points, and any time you want, you can press the touchpad to start at the beginning. The goal is to make it through a course in one go, but you will also probably burst out laughing every time your rider faceplants.

This all equates to a game that you can pop in to kill a few minutes, or play for extended periods (if you don't mind saying ""oh, sh!#"" a lot).

Graphics are very nice, but I think the main advantage of this type of game on a next gen console is the smoothness of play.","Simple to learn, but challenging and lots of fun"

Otherwise the game does use passwords, but they're very cumbersome, put you in all different spots and without previous powerups or lives.

B000A5K5MI,5.0,"This one is 100x better than the first one! Words can't describe how happy this game has made me. Because Kamari Damancy is the result of game developers doing too many herb, I'm no even going to try to describe the story too much. What matters is that this game will make you smile!

Story: Basically fans on earth, from humans to animals, are asking the king of the cosmos for favors which include the Prince or any one of his cousins rolling up a huge Katamari. Thats pretty much the story.

Content and levels: OH BOY! They added alot more detail to this one than the last game. The levels are way, WAY, more original and theres a lot more of them, too. It feels like they put alot more detail in the levels and what you roll up. I remember rolling up some things that made me go ""WTF"" due to how insane they were. The katamaris are also more original. To name a few, you get a burning katamari, snow katamari, and a racing katamari (my favorite). I've already finished the whole game, but even after the game is over theres still alot of challenges.

Music: This is probably the heart of the series. Just like the first game, the music is catchy and will never fail at making you feel happy inside. The music is like a drug! I'm sitting down, eating breakfast, and all I can think about is ""NA-NANA-NA-NANANANA-KADAMACY ON THE SWING"" or ""I CAN SING A SONG FOR OL'FUFU LOVE! I LOVE YOU""! My favorite songs are ""Everlasting Love"", ""Disco*Prince"", ""Sunbaked Savanah"", and ""Angel Rain"". Its an added plus, that you can change the song for each level, so you can hear your favorite, which the first game didn't have. If you're ever in a bad mood, just play any song from this game.

B00SX9UD8E,5.0,"Hunting monsters has been a decade long pastime for many gamers since the first Monster Hunter released back in 2004 on the PlayStation 2.  Over those years, the games have up the ante and tweaked several aspects of the game to improve the monster hunting experience, and with the recent release of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3DS, the hunt is even more enjoyable and a great access point for beginners looking to topple their first monster.

Monster Hunter's gameplay can best be described as an action role playing game (RPG) with deep roots into set collecting.  Where Monster Hunter (MH) differs from most RPGs is in the leveling system.  There isn't a single level to gain that's more commonly found in RPGs.  Rather than add some stat points to damage or defense after a required amount of points are met, here the amount of damage and defense that carry you throughout the game ties into the weapons and armor your equipped with that are made up with parts of the monsters you fight.  That's where the set collection comes in.

The monsters you'll be fighting to farm their parts to make new weapons and armor are outstanding.  Each one is animated to life, and it doesn't matter if it's a small raptor looking dinosaur to a giant stone dragon, each one has their own set of moves and qualities to them.  It's easy to classify each one as a boss fight, learning their patterns, weaknesses, and preparing for the fight are a must.  As you kill or capture these beasts, you'll accumulate parts from them to build/forge and upgrade weapons and armor each that reflect the monster in which they came from.  If the monster does poison and you make a hammer from its parts, it'll have poison stats associated with it.  The one, and only, warning I give new players is the grinding nature of the game.  If your not a fan of grinding the same monster...hoping for that one reward/part you need to finish it's set of armor...than this game may/will get underskin.

The gameplay has been revamped this go around and the results make the game even more thrilling than ever before.  The simple addition of having vertical terrain along with the new gameplay mechanic to allow a hunter to mount a monster never gets old.  Now hunter rush up the side of cliff sides and vault over lower terrain of the maps, giving you an opportune time to strike down a monster from above.  Added in is also the new glaive weapon that even allows you to pole vault up in the air for similar results.

The game also makes the single player ""story"" more streamlined and fun to follow.  I use the word story loosely since the game is still lacking real depth but there are more cinematics and events tossed throughout the campaign to make it more than the previous outtings.  The game also has expedition quests that charge you with scouting out the area and local monsters.  Multiplayer has always been a blast in the MH series and now the game is easier to get in and out of the multiplayer segments than in the past and teaming up with 3 other friends is always fun way to go hunting.

Nintendo's New 3DS system makes good use of the included circle pad pro but older models that have the add-on will still work with the game.  The touchpad can be customized with different layouts to what best suites your needs along with provide you with shortcuts to the multiplayer and locations.  The new system's faster processing makes loading screens.....an issue with past installments...mere seconds and not even noticeable.

In the end, if you're a veteran monster hunter and rabid fan or just a curious consumer looking for a game that's easily worth the money, than I highly recommend this game for a purchase.  Good luck in your future hunts.",New or Old Hunters Welcomed
B00026V3V2,5.0,"I must admit, I like ""The Suffering"" ALOT. I'm a great fan of the TPS horror genre and the Silent Hill series in particular. I can't yet say whether this game is as scary as SH but already it's given me goosebumps.

The graphics are fantastic and the game is unbelievably atmospheric. Many gamers will also be pleased to know that you don't need a top of the range PC to run this game smoothly. I have relatively average specs and the game runs like a dream (Athlon XP 1700+ 512MB RAM)

The controls are also very simple to get used to and there aren't too many in-game options to confuse you. People of a weak disposition probably wouldn't appreciate this game because it does use alot of coarse language and it is very bloody. However, if you have an open mind and would like to play a game which is just a little bit different from most TPS', then I would definately recommend it to you.

The basic outline of the game is the following:

You have just been transfered to a prison on an island off the Maryland coast. The other prisoners start to divulge in irrelevant discourse amongst themselves and suddenly the electricity starts to fail and the guards and inmates all meet very gruesome deaths at the hands of various malevolent and deformed creatures who make a dramatic entrance through the prison ceiling. From that point on, it's all about you staying alive by any and all means necessary.",Very impressive TPS

B001TOQ8MU,5.0,"So far I really like this game. I will go ahead and give it 5 stars even though it's probably not the greatest game ever. I expected it not to be. I knew that it would be fun and it is. It doesn't have to stack up to the Call of Duty series or Halo because it's different and that's the way I like it. I will also give it 5 stars because I know that many others will leave biased negative reviews and trash the game. The only thing about the game that I would have liked to see different is that the levels are a little too linear. I really haven't had a chance to play on multiplayer yet because I got the game early and there was nobody on. I started playing on the Marine campaign and, let me tell you it's a little creepy. It's dark and very atmospheric, just the way it should be. Your'e little motion tracker is thumping and you don't know when one of those aliens is going to just jump right out at you. You'll see the blips on you're tracker but they don't always come at you. Just the way it should be IMOP. Plus killing the aliens isn't always easy. They do maneuver just like they're supposed to and sometimes you will have to unload an entire clip on one just to kill it. The outer exoskeleton shell of the alien is hard like it's supposed to be and it takes a lot to kill the damn things. I think with the majority of negative reviewers they won't like a game unless it's Modern Warfare this day and age. I won't go into the details of the game because others on here are already taking care of that and I haven't played enough of it yet. I don't think I will be changing my stance on it the more I play. I like it. It's fun. That's all you need. It's so simple and doesn't need to be all complicated as to why a game is enjoyable. So far, so good!",I'm enjoying it....

B00NFXON1Q,5.0,"This is a nice upgrade from the XBOX 360, and for the price, I'm not sure how you can beat it. Some pros and cons below, and most of the cons are things that can be easily remedied, so get on it Microsoft!

PROS
+ Bundled Price: 500GB XBOX One with two games (AC: Black Flag, and AC: Unity) for $350.00.  Difficult to argue with that deal. Only issue was the games were digital, not hard copies, which takes away some value for sure, as well as the fact they both take up a tremendous amount of space. Still a great deal.

+ Controller: I was a big fan of the XBOX 360 controller, and this one is an improvement on that, while still being familiar.

+Graphics: The graphics seem so much nicer and sleeker on the XBO as opposed to the XBOX 360.

CONS
- Storage Space: The XBOX One comes with 500GB, but it really doesn't. After the software that comes on it, plus all the updates, you're really down a good amount of storage space. With the industry trending to an all digital library of games and such, storage space becomes more important then ever. You'd think with this next generations of consoles, 1TB would be the standard, not the upgrade. After installing AC: Unity, already I've used up 10.5% of my total storage space. Not cool.

- Console Size/Power Brick: With all the micro-technology around today, you'd think that things could be made smaller. You'd think they could build the power brick right into this huge console. I just want one simple wire running to an electrical outlet to power the console, but this huge brick is there taking up a lot of space. I'd like to see a console a lot sleeker with a lot more power, and I feel like the technology is there to make that happen.

- Digital Download: Three main issues. First off the time to download takes a LONG time. It took almost 12 hours to pre-install AC: Unity. Second the value goes down because you can't resell the game once you purchase it, or use it on a friend's console. Third off the amount of space it takes up is tremendous. When you only have a limited amount of space on the XBOX, and it fills up fast, you're forced to choose what games you want. I'm all for futuristic downloads where I'll never even need to go to a store to buy it, rather just enter the code and it works. But when you buy the console it needs to come with a hardcopy of the game.

- Packaging: I have to say I find the packaging on the XBOX One incredibly cheap looking (at least compared to my XBOX 360).",Even Great Products Have Issues

B00KVSQAGO,5.0,"**UPDATE2:** (3/10/15) Online Heists have FINALLY made it to GTA.
**UPDATE:** (1/8/15) While I am enjoying GTAV some days the online servers work great, but most days I cannot connect to a single person. I realize R* has some work to do and is busy adding in the Heist Missions via a large upcoming DLC/Patch, but all the same, some server stability in the mean time would be great. I expected a bit more polish to the much touted GTA Online from R*'s awesome dev team.

Rockstar deserves your love, not for re-releasing a game from last gen, but for adding so much new content and updating the game so much; GTAV may just be a port, but it's a damn awesome port.
Mostly all I need to say is 2 things: FIRST PERSON MODE (FPM) & HEISTS!!!

Finally you get to enjoy the beautiful graphics and experience the whole world up close and personal. Thankfully the new FPM works great lets you see the whole game in high detail, especially enjoyable are the new controls specifically for FPM which allow you to have more familiar FPS like button uses. I for one thank Rockstar for releasing games that aren't a broken buggy mess needing patch after patch just to play, but most of all Rockstar is FINALLY going to release the long awaited Heist Missions!

GTA is like the Skyrim of cars, hookers, and punching random pedestrians. It's not a game for everyone, but it's crazy and silly and has more than enough content to keep even ADD riddled little Billy happy for hours while he ogles strippers from first person perspective. Giggity

There's new vehicles, new weapons, 100 new songs on the radio, new wildlife, stock car races, and other events, etc. As well the game boasts some updated visuals via increased draw distance, more traffic, and and a higher resolution for both XboxOne & PS4 (with a slight frame rate advantage to the Xbox One version) I for one am extremely excited to be jumping back into GTAV. Obviously if you didn't enjoy it the first time it's still the same game so steer clear, to fans and others check it out.",GTAV is back with new content & First Person Mode!

B00009V3KM,5.0,"I bought the Sims Double Deluxe a few years back as it was on sale at CompUSA and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Well, I went back the next day and bought all the expansions including Makin' Magic.

Well, I moved on to other games, uninstalling this one an put it on the shelf, promptly forgetting about it. Then my computer died and I got a refurbished eMachines which was superior to my Dell. (NOT in quality, but in simple system specs. Dell rules.) I bought several games that required more Umpf than my Dell could give, but I grew weary of them quickly.

Then I remembered my Sims collection. It took three days to install them to the point that I could play. What happened was that there is apparently a non visible defect on the play disk for Makin' Magic that would cause it to destroy the installation of the entire game, causing me to have to start all over from scratch. Eventually, I stopped with Superstar and played for awhile, but I really REALLY wanted Makin' Magic back, so off to Amazon I went.

I bought my replacement copy from NothingButSoftware for a song... like... 9 bucks. I ordered it before bedtime on Thursday and it was waiting for me at the post office Saturday morning. Dang.

Anyway, aside from the original game that introduced the whole concept, Makin' Magic is THE most important expansion of all. It changes the whole dynamic of the game. It gives you things you can do that serve a greater purpose than just to increase your motives. You create new items and have a whole new world of ways to interact with other characters.

As I said in the title, I'm a bit reserved about buying The Sims 2 because I like this so much. I wonder if it would be superior... or is it more style than substance. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love creating and furnishing new homes, but I just think it's going to be tough to top Makin' Magic...",I enjoy this so much I'm afraid to try The Sims 2

B001IK5TJI,5.0,"I may offer a little different review than most because I'm in my 30's and never really had been into RPG's before.

But I must say, that after about my first hour of Dragon Age Origins, I was hooked. So I have finally finished it after at least 40+ hours of gameplay. I have to assume that 40+ hours they keep track of is in terms of actual gameplay time. I probably put in twice that much in terms of menu's/ loading/ saving/ and on pause - either looking at the map, the quest directions, or going through your inventory of items. So for the money ($40!), this is a ridiculously good value.

The ability to create your own character is one of the highlights of any game for me, and this one did a good job on that front. I like that certain choices you make in your character's background/ race will help determine your skill sets/ attributes.

The gameplay is good. I thought it did a good job of mixing finding things with a fair amount of fighting. I thought the fighting system was pretty easy to understand and pick up right away. I also thought that managing the items in your inventory/backpack was kind of fun too, even if it can be quite time-consuming. At some points, I thought to myself, ""OK there's just too much stuff to pickup/ buy/ find/ etc!""

I also liked that you can turn on the subtitles when viewing the cut-scenes. That way you can read through it a lot faster than if you wait for all of the dialog to finish. The Square button lets you fast forward the scene. So that's a big time saver there.

At times, it felt kind of like an old ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure"" book because certain decisions you make during the game will have impacts later on. At one point, I wound up making a decision, and having one of the party members turn against me, so we had to kill her. So she was obviously, permanently out of my posse.

I liked that I could play it on Casual difficulty, since I don't have thaaaaat much free-time now that I'm a little older. Plus I'm too old to keep trying it over and over again, and too old for throwing my controller all over the room.

Overall, a very great game that sucked me into the story / world / characters. Some of the characters are quite memorable/ amusing/ funny.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. So much so, that I'll probably start all over again as a different character to see how it'll play out differently. Highly recommended.",Dragon Age - Origins (PS3)

B00I0A363A,5.0,"Pros
 *The barter system is great, it replaces the inflated gold system and avoids tons of gold pilling up that never gets used.
*The talent tree and Gem skill systems allow for complete freedom that doesn't force the player into one role.
*The graphics, lighting, and music adds a hopless feeling to the game reminding me of Diablo and Diablo II.
*A welcome return to having idenity and portal scroles, and health and mana potions that refill ask you attack.
*Unlike Diablo III which gives you too many or to of fast recovey of resources, PoE puts good resource management back into players hands.
*It is free, and expansions are free.
* A large world with tons to explore that is never the same twice.*Good PvP and League options.

Cons
*Your can't change the sex of your characters.
*Camrea control limited.

Path of Exile is a great game needed in the action hack slash RPG genera.  With Diablo III not living up to many people's expectations this game might offer them a good alternative. Path Of Exile has a dark, griddy, and has hopeless feel that recalls memories of the first two Diablo games. You are given six classes to choose from and unlock and seventh once you beat the game on normal. For some reason you cannot change the sex of the class you choose, which seems a little outdated. A more indepth character creator that allows the player to choose the sex, and skin color of the character would be nice.

 I loved Diablo III, playing well over 150 hours of the game, but my biggest issue with it was the lack of depth in the talents and character development. Path Of Exile almost drowns me in depth. For every character level gained, and as a reward for some quests, a skill point for passive skills is received. The passive talent tree is huge! It will start you out with two to three paths to choose from but you can really expand in any direct with a little effort, making the classes very fluid and not pagging you in one roll. All of your classes' active abilities are determined by gems which are socketed into your weapons and armor. This allows a more physical class like the Marudar to raise zombies or rain down fire on a monster, instead of just hitting the mobs with a hammer or sword. Some gems will add bonuses to other gems with links in the armor between the sockets, and like your character all the gems level up. You can remove any gem from any item and any time, and with magic orbs you find, change the color or amount of the sockets. The magical orbs also add or remove stats from armor. You truely have freedom to make your class anything your want. Once the game is beat on normal difficulty the Scion class is unlocked which has an easier time moving through the passive talent tree by starting in the middle of the tree. The main difference in the classes is where they start in the passive talent tree. I find myself looking at the passive talent tree for my next path, and playing with the gems I find to get the most out of the them.

In almost every hack and slash action RPG that I have played, I seem to have an issue that I gather tons of gold, and rarley use much of it. Some games like Diablo II or III this problem results in inflation. In Diablo II and III a death penalty where you lose gold tries combat the inflation in the game, but doesn't work well. Path of Exile fixes this issue by, removing the gold and introducting the player to a barter system, trading scrolls and magical orbs that effect the make up of an item, for the items themselves and vice versa. Many orbs are much more rare then others, and like the Orb of Alechmey that makes a non magical item, a rare item, which you might not want to trade it to a vendor. To buy an Orb of Alchemy the off of a vendor, you find it requiring other items that are rare also. This barder system helps remove the tons of gold that is gathered and never used in many actions RPGs. With no gold in PoE the death penalty is your experance. In normal difficulty there is no death penalty, but the higher in difficulty level that you go up the hard hit in loss of experance when you die. Many people might not like this, but I for one have missed a really siginfcant death penalty like experance lost. I really feel that if you can lose a level when you die, a player learns to become a better and more careful player.

The graphics, sound, and lighting, of the game all have a griddy, realistic effect. This is a dark game, in a huge world that feels dark and hopeless. There are some bright areas yea, but the dark areas are very dark, much more so then Diablo III. The world is huge and never the same. Many times a quest has had me go back through a zone, or I have to go through a zone I almost had finished exploring, but had to log out of of the game before I was done, and each time the zone was different, never the same. The game is only three act, but each act is huge with tons to find and explore. Many of the quests will have you make decisions that effect the story. While you can zoom in very far on your character in game, you can't turn or rotate the the camera which should really be in this type of game.

Path of Exile has for resources life and mana, nothing to flashy. While many people like Diablo III's fact that every class has a different resouce, I like good old mana, and missed in it D3. The way mana and health refill is slowly over time when you are out of combat, and with bottles of potions in combat. The bottles can be found in different sizes, and with migical propities. Making resoure managment more difficult somewhat, but also more rewarding. There are different leagues and PVP options in PoE, and events like races through areas or zones mulitpul times a day to take part in. This gives the player mulitpul things to do in the game.

Path of Exile is a completely free game with free expansion or contect up dates. The game does have a cash shop, of which everything on it is for comfort, or cosmetic, no buy to win. Armor/weapon skins/effects are on the shop with expansions to your stash (which isn't really needed, they give you a bunch of room), guild rooster size upgrade and guild stash. I would like to see more things like a name change or the adding of a last name to a character on the shop also. I disappointed by the lack of stuff in the cash shiop because I want to give Path of Exile more money. This game is easily worth a normal 60 dollar price tage, and maybe even more with the content updates.","Better then Diablo III,"

B0001KUE7S,5.0,"Doom 3 is hardly fun, but it is an addictive & absorbingly realistic videogame.  If you are a fan of the 1st or 2nd Alien movies you will love this experience.  I haven't played a Doom game since I played the first PC version back in the early 90s.  I was just as blown away then as I am now.  Many reviewers seem to think that not much has changed with this franchise, but in reality not much has changed to the FPS format in general.  Everyone seems to tout Halo so highly but in terms of game play they feel identical.  The control set up and movements are identical.  The weird unnatural jump is identical.  Unlike the Halo games though, Doom 3's campaign mode really shines (you won't beat this game in 6 hours or cake walk through the last few levels).  The developers did everything in their arsenal to immerse you in the experience.  Every new room you walk into has the potential to kill you.  You will find yourself hugging the walls and checking all the corners. You are constantly terrorized and ganged up on by some pretty nasty looking monsters.  The enemies you will encounter take full advantage of the darkness, laying hidden until they are right on top of you.  Sure the A. I. isn't the greatest, but then again a grisly bear wouldn't carefully consider the best way to kill you.  Does that make the prospect of several grisly bears charging at you all at once any less terrifying?

Pros:

-Visuals: Everything looks great.  You run past so much glorious detail that it just feels decadent.  Very little is left to your imagination.  Just don't look down at fallen

  enemies or you will realize you are about 15 feet tall.

-(External) Sound Effects: Basically everything that is not you sounds awesome and goes miles in creating a life threatening sense of terror.

-Excellent enemy design.  The majority of monsters in this game look and move like they want to eviscerate you. Too bad there aren't cool kill moves like Resident Evil 4.

Cons (it is the little details that make a master piece in my books):

-(Internal) Sound Effects: Your Weapons sound muted and lack power (Listen to the weapon sound effects in Resident Evil 4 to see what I mean).  What the hell is up with

 the goofy clankty clomp sounds it makes when you walk?  It sounds like you are being trailed by the Three Stooges.

-Frame rate: Basically things get a little choppy if you look around too fast.

-Frequent load times that break up the tension.",I was just as blown away then as I am now.

B00KAED7OC,5.0,"This game is a TON of fun Its my favorite game. Its very hard to complete the campaign missions though. whenever I try to do them I am on my way and I see a outpost close by or a animal I need to hunt to craft something and I get sidetracked and end up being sidetracked for a couple hours though that's not really a bad thing. Also its a blast raiding a outpost or a fortress with a buddy on co-op. I love being able to ride elephants if there is one close by I always get on one and shoot anyone I see. There is so much to do you could easily spend 20+ hours seeing all there is to do.one thing I don't like though is that I really like the main enemy pagan min he is a interesting character but the problem is you really never see him for hours after the intro. Also I haven't played much of multiplayer but from what I have it somewhat resembles battlefield in terms huge maps, vehicles, etc. but there are some major differences there are 2 opposed factions that fight the Golden path (who have modern weapons ak-47's,RPG's,Shotguns,Etc) and then there is the Rashaka (they have more traditional weapons Bow's as well as the ability to cloak themselves and they can summon wild animals to attack there enemy's).Overall This game is one of the best I have ever played in my personal opinion. I would highly recommend it

(P.S. I have never had the chance to play far cry 3 so I cant really compare it to FC3)",Amazing...

B0014WJ78E,5.0,"I must admit, I didn't buy this bundle game system because of Metal Gear Solid 4. I purchased it, because of three other factors:

1. Its more cost effective than purchasing the 40 gig PS3. You get a dual shock controller with vibration, 40 more gig hard drive, ability to play 70% of PS2 games and of course a free game, all for $499. If you purchased the 40 gig PS3 at $399, you'll still have to buy a game at $60, which is $459. So, for an extra $40 bucks, you get all the extra bells and whistles. Anybody that has any common sense knows this is a better deal.

2. When I purchased this bundle, I got no payments or finance charges for 18 months. So in essences, I'm paying less than $30 a month, which is a sweet deal. I'll pay it off before the 18 months is over. That's the only way I would have paid over $500 for a game.

3. God of War 3 is coming out next year and by the time its out, I would have paid off my PS3. Don't get me wrong, from what I heard, the Metal Gear Solid series, including number 4 is a great series. And I have Metal Gear Solid 2 & 3. I just haven't played them yet, so before I start playing MGS4, I'll play 2 & 3.

For right now, the system works great. I have no complaints. I placed mine in my entertainment stand. The PS3 does get very warm. So, I cut a hole in the back of the shelve, where the PS3 sits and brought a very small, but powerful fan from Wal-mart and placed it outside the back of the shelve, where the PS3 sits, and the fan pull all of the warm air out through the back of my stand. Kind-of-like a homemade ventilation system and it works great! I had considered buying these attachable ""cooling"" fans for my PS3, however, I heard so many conflicting information about them, that I decided to make my own. Which I'm happy I did. The fan from Wal-mart only cost me $5 bucks. The other ""cooling"" devices cost as much as $30 bucks, so I saved even more money. Thank God! With high gas prices I can stand to save every dime I get.

I only play my PS3 about 3-4 hours a week, and I'm still playing my first PS3 game (Medal of Honor Airborne, I purchased it with my bundle). I like to master a game before moving on to the next game. But for any person the want something to do during some down time or a serious gamer, I would recommend this system to you.",Great Game System for the Price!
B008QLUTHO,5.0,"The only season that is pointless is summer, it's only fun IF you go to the town square and partake in events otherwise it's spring with sun burns.. and hail stones. overall, it's about freakin time we have weather. the sims 3 has been rather BORING up until now.

I honestly would like a disasters pack sometime in the future, (floods,earthquakes,etc.,)

this pack certainly adds a huge amount of stuff, I can't believe EA pulled christmas tree's and related items off the store, politically correct DUMB DUMBS... I hate it when companies can't offend anyone, it's a HOLIDAY themed pack... Christmas HALLOWEEN and EASTER are all non offensive holidays, ea renames them Snowflake day and other idiotic names... SNOWFLAKE DAY??? really?? If you people are offended by Christmas as a holiday name then I ask you to move to another planet...

Anyways, I use Nraas Master Controller for extra Cheaty things like Shift clicking the ground and making it snow in the middle of summer or other bizarre things like that.. Even modifying aliens to have bigger boobs, be more flirtatious,etc., even rank up my sim to have all the new hidden skills maxed out so they can shred the half pipe..

I do love this EP just hate the lawyer crowd that made all the normal holidays sound retarded... seriously, snowflake day??? LOL

B00002SVOJ,5.0,"Golden Axe is a game which was a arcade game, brought onto Sega Genesis. It is a side scrolling game that's basically a beat'em up RPG. Two people can play together simultaneously or you can roll solo. Players can pick between 3 characters. A warrior/barbarrian like character with a sword. A lady also wielding a sword. And also a dwarf that has a double bladed axe. Each of the three characters have the ability of using a different type of magic. Golden Axe rocks just as much now as it did upon it's release!!! It's a simple game, yet has it's challenges. The Genesis version even has more levels than the arcade. As you fight various bad guys (including skeleton w/ swords,giants w/ giant sledge hammers,ect..) you even get the chance to ride some mythical beasts. Two different types of dragons & a weird looking one, that has a tale you use to hit advisaries with. The blue dragon breathes fire towards the ground. And the red dragon breathes fireballs towards whatever direction your facing. You work your way through levels to reach & fight Death Adder. The gameplay is simplistic & enjoyable! The graphics we're good when it came out. And pretty good for it's time still, in my opinion. If you push either left or right on the D-pad twice (holding down the second  push) you'll run towards an enemy. You can then hit the attack button to do a cool attack. The dwarf will do a headbutt with his viking helmet. The warrior/barbarrian does a shoulder nudge. And the lady does a flying kick. You are allowed a certain amount of continues. Also, your able to add some health and continues (if I remember) in th options menu. The music really fits the game & it's levels too! I highly recommend this game to anyone that has never played it, but likes old school games.",Among the best Of Genesis & classic gaming!

Not having the blaster or lightsaber in hand makes fights more interesting. I had to throw chairs and bottles, take a sword/ guns away from an enemy to use it, and avoid bullets at times. I thought the levels I played were complex and pretty long the home base college was put together well. The game offers many cut scene movies that lead into or complete the level, and as with the other Lego titles there is a unique brand of humor in all of them.

B0009VXBAQ,5.0,"I had to wait a very long time for my Wii and when i finally did it, i had been waiting outside Target for 6 hours. Thats only after waiting outside other various stores for weeks on end. Those of you who have rated the Wii poorly (collecting dust) and what have you...why aren't there more for sale in used then?
With that said...some of it's true. Games: blah. When it first came out i couldn't find anything i really really enjoyed. Excite Truck, Need for Speed and of course Zelda.
NOW though...upcoming releases like resident evil chronicals where you play like you're in an arcade, only to be followed up by the release or the wii zapper. Guitar Hero III comming out for the Wii, tomb raider, mario galaxy, boxing...there are just so many being released in the next few months.
I think the wii is very versitle and while at first the wii wasn't really for heavy gamers because the graphics aren't PS3 style (but compare them to the atari and what do you have? great graphics) but now they have made up for the graphics (which i think are perfectly acceptable, if i wanted perfect graphics i'd just watch a movie in high-def) by producing games for the avid gamer and games for the family (mario kart is comming out soon).

B0058SHNF4,5.0,"I got this for our family game night and it was a lot of fun.  This game will be remain a staple in our weekly video game night until we can progress to more complicated dance games.  I have two boys (8 & 10) and wanted to find something that would be fun without having to worry about the song selection.  You'd be surprised at some of the songs included for kids games.  All 40 songs were kid friendly and ranged from pre-school to pop songs and I would rate the age range from 3-8 but it also works for families.

Please note that you must have a PS3 Move controller to be able to play this game.  The moves are simple and can progress but are never difficult.  I would recommend this to beginners only.  We've tried ""Just Dance"" and ""Dance Revolution"" for wii but that was a bit tricky for our youngest so we went with this game and are happy with the choice.  It is easy to set up and my kids figured it out without guidance.  You can play one song at a time, string them together or use the shuffle function.  A filter for age range is provided and you can make up playlists for up to 10 songs.  My only complaint is that I wish additional songs could be downloaded instead of having to buy additional discs but this is minor so I didn't deduct any points.

B01GW3POY0,5.0,"With the recent slew of action based Resident Evils (Movies, RE 5, 6, and some spin off games) the developers decided to go back to survival horror with their main line title, Resident Evil 7 Biohazard.

This game in my opinion is the best in the series as it has modern first person controls (no more lame tank controls like in most of the games in the series) mixed with survival horror which the series was built upon...and sort of lost it's way after RE4. Glad they rebooted (sorta) the series though as the only references to past games are herbs, news clippings of racoon city, and a name drop in the end. They even omitted the required bazooka in the last boss sequence

Atmosphere is great in this game. I recommend using a headset or turn up your home theater  surround sound for full effect. Game felt very tense going in and expected a random pop-up scare at any moment when first exploring the environment in the game especially with the house making random noises. But 5-10 after the first human encounter the horror factor died down for me as I got used to the lay of the land. This is coming from someone who doesn't flinch or get nightmares from horror movies. Pop up scare is not real horror it's just there to test your sympathetic nervous system is working

Characters in this game are really good. They've got a Chain Saw Massacre type boss enemy, along with one that build traps like in the Saw movies. There are minor puzzles in the game, but for the most part you are just collecting items and keys to get to the next area while trying to survive, pick up items, looking for collectables, resource managing and looking out/escape from enemies in the process.

Story is very good. It's more realistic than the past two or three main games. You lost your wife for 2-3years and you finally get a random e-mail video saying she's still alive. She tells you not to go find her, but you do anyway. Then you enter this creepy haunted house of sorts trying to rescue her.

This game is compatible with Playstation VR. I do not own one so cannot give you first hand accounts, but I heard it is a more immersive experience. Just keep a habit of shutting your eye lids when scared because using your hands to over your eyes while it's still open will not work ;)

-Replay value is low. There's no multiplayer online mode, but there is DLC down the line. There are 2 endings for the game with the choice being given at the 3/4 point of the game. If you want to experience both endings I'd make a different save file slot after you make the deciding choice (it's obviously apparent when it happens). Other than that you can try to get PSN trophies. Platinum is somewhat easy with the hardest being:
Complete the game using only 3 First Aid Meds or less,
Complete the game without opening the Item Box more than 3 times.
Complete the game on Madhouse difficulty
The first two may be difficult having not played the game before and the last one may be a bit frustrating if you don't' have a steady hand and miss those headshots or have a tough time scrounging for bullets. I'd say at least 3-4 playthrough to get the platinum trophy if you're good and dedicated enough.

Game is very short at around 10-12 hours for the first playthrough depending on how many gameover screens you encounter, and how much you explore . But the hours spent is pure quality and definitely worth a buy if you're into horror games.

Overall this game is totally worth it if you're into horror games. Having played this game it's hard to got back to the tank controls of past RE survival horror (not action based) games. One of the best games released so far this year",Return to the horror roots.

B009CL6LA6,5.0,"First off, I got this headset as part of the amazon vine program, which means I got it for free in return for product testing / review. I put about 10 hours use into these playing Borderlands 2 on my 360. However, I elected not to keep these for myself since they did not fit my abnormally large head. It was too tight of a fit to be comfortable for me. I gave these to a friend to try out and he LOVED them. He has much less of a bobble head than myself. (see product shot of him wearing the headset and the ""cool story babe"" tshirt) He's a very big dude himself with a large melon and they fit him without incident.

The cushions are excellent quality and I found them breathable even after several hours of play. Design is well thought out. Audio, even though in stereo instead of surround, is crisp and clean. In Borderlands you can actually hear the difference in footsteps on different terrain like rocky ground vs snow.

Bass boost mode is especially good. The 50mm Neodynium drivers are excellent. Bordering on audiophile level sound quality, ESPECIALLY for a wireless gaming headset. That's almost unheard of. Immersive mode is similar to 3d sound, but not quite what I would consider surround.

It should be noted that my regular headset is the wired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ear-Force-X11-Amplified-Stereo-Headset-with-Chat/dp/B003A7HHKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ear Force X11 Amplified Stereo Headset with Chat</a>, which is an exceptional headset in itself. Sound quality on the afterglow is better, which is a bit boggling given that the comparison is to a wired headset.

Looks very slick

B0006B0O9U,5.0,"This is a must have game, I really like this game a lot. I loved the original as well and usually I prefer platform over handheld but I am usually pretty open to trying different games so anything I can get my hands on I will take it. This is one of those popular must have Nintendo DS Games that no gamer can live without. I am definitely one of those people. I got this game at a used store for $20.00 plus the case was free, and it had the cover the manual, precaution booklet and everything else.
There are actually quite a few pros and cons in the game itself, so let me start with the negatives then I will talk about the positives,
Cons/Negatives and Postives/Pros about the game:

Pro/Con #1: No M, W or L Caps in Bowser Worlds:

Con: Whenever you go into one of the Three encounter worlds to face Bowser for example Bowser in the Dark World, Bowser in the Fire Sea or Bowser in the Sky there are no Mario, Wario or Luigi caps available anywhere in the level so if you enter for example as Yoshi, Mario, Wario or Luigi then the player is that character and there is no cheat code that can change that, thats the way game is formatted when you enter Bowser's world that requires taking him down.

Pro: Though there are no caps if however one is not trying to get to Bowser and lets say you only entered the level to get the 8 red coins star and/or get the star switch star or both then it would be perfectly acceptable to enter as any character but the character I recommend that you enter any one of the Bowser levels is Mario and Mario alone. Though any Character can take Bowser down easily.

Pro/Con #2: Big Fingers  Small Buttons and Small D-Pad = Big Pain in the butt
Con: If this game is played for too long and you have big fingers then your hands might hurt and one should not spend all day playing video games depending on the model of Nintendo DS or 3DS you have.
Pro: However it depends on what model Nintendo DS you have, for example it might not be a good idea to play this game for too long especially if you have a Nintendo DS lite because a DS lite is more of a Nintendo DS that is for traveling or everyday on the go. If you have a DSi or DSi XL or a 3DS or 3DS XL then you might be OK because those buttons tend to be bigger. If you have an Original Nintendo DS the D-pad is no problem or the buttons. But I might be wrong about the DS model.

Pro/Con #3: Moves are difficult with the Stylus depending on what mode your playing in.
Con: Throwing or Ground pound or long jumping etc are difficult.
Pro: But it depends on if your playing in Standard Mode, Touch Mode or Dual Hand mode so I guess if your a pro with your stylus then maybe a more advanced mode is for you, but were all different.

Overall that's all the pros and cons I have about this game but I still give this game 5 stars because its like playing the classic N64 version only better for handheld. My final thoughts was why a game like this was never put into development for the Wii or Wii U or 3DS, but you know maybe just maybe Nintendo will make this game for one or all of those systems. I still recommend this game for the Family and for kids its a Family oriented game. I highly recommend it!",Super Mario 64 DS The Best of the original!

B000ZKBJXC,5.0,"i have played a few games based on movies since i first got my old NES. i've played some good ones and some that should've been flushed right down the crapper.

B000VJRU44,5.0,"This little device is a blast.  We got it for Christmas 2008 and the whole family loves it.  The combination of games, exercises and yoga it is very easy to find something for everyone.  I have 4 kids ranging in ages from 10-18 and everyone has used it daily for almost 2 weeks now.
The pad itself seems to be built very durable.  The top is hard white plastic and only a few inches high.  The small size and height are great for sliding under the coach while not in use.  The wireless connection means you don't have the clutter of cords running everywhere.  I can't comment yet on the battery life.
The games/sections of the software are good.  They have good graphics for the games and ok for the yoga/strength sections.  The yoga, strength sections have your choice between a male or female trainer.  The only part of them that bugs me is their lips don't move when they talk, but otherwise they are pleasant and helpful.
I only have minor complaints about the software, like for our family we are all weighting in every day.  The little avatar asks about the others in our family.  For example "" do you think Dad looks over-weight?"" and then advices you if you should talk to them about it.  Maybe not big brother, but little sibling in training.  The software also keeps track of the high scores, but not on a personal level.  It would be nice to have your own record section to see if you are improving.
All I can say is that this is a great product.  The construction is solid and the game play / training is good and has keep my whole family involved.",Family Fun

B0009UBR3A,5.0,"In 2003, after Nintendo's first try bringing Zelda to the Gamecube with The Wind Waker, the game suffered mixed reactions from fans. Some loved the new art style, while others moaned about its childish look. Zelda fans would have to endure several delays and ultimately wait three years for the next console title. Fortunately, Nintendo came out with The Minish Cap for the GBA in 2005 to keep fans occupied. Nintendo began to release tantalizing images and trailers for their upcoming Zelda game. The return to the traditional art style promised that Twilight Princess would make all the fans happy.
(Note: I will not summarize the game's storyline in this review.)

Let's start off with controls: after the numerous delays, Nintendo decided to move Twilight Princess (which was originally a Gamecube title) to their next-gen console, the  Wii. However, Miyamoto assured the fans that had already pre-ordered the Gamecube version that it would be released as well. For the Wii version, the game was quickly revamped with the Wii remote in mind. This caused the Wii version to identically ""mirror"" the Gamecube version. But since I am reviewing the Gamecube version, I'll talk about its controls. The game controls in a very similar way to the Wind Waker. The item, map, and quest status screens were redesigned somewhat, though.

Twilight Princess' graphics feel very nostalgic for Ocarina of Time. It show a lot of improvement, with backgrounds that look very crisp and detailed and features more life-like characters. The game is definitely the most cinematic of the Zelda titles to date, with dramatic and epic cut-scenes. Some levels and areas like the City in the Sky and the Sacred Grove feel very Miyazaki-inspired in their art design.

The music and sound department is good, not great. The game features many remixed Zelda songs from games like Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past. It's new songs are very good but aren't nearly as catchy as songs from, say, Ocarina of Time. I don't find anything wrong with the lack of voice acting (I like to read!), but it is getting to be a trait that is a little conspicuous at this point. On the other hand, Nintendo is staying on the safe side by not risking their luck with voice actors that could sound really stupid in the English dub (""Excuuuse Me, Princess!"").

Last but not least, difficulty. For the most part, the game isn't that hard. It has a couple mind-bending puzzles, but the its real focus is action and adventure. The dungeon bosses are awesome but generally easy, too. Because of this, I would not say buying a walkthrough is worth it for this game (for games like Zelda II, it's a different story!)

Overall, this is the game the fans wanting a true sequel to Ocarina of Time were waiting for, go out and get it! And for all the rest, go and buy it too, I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much :)!",Excellent Zelda Adventure!

B001ELI4S4,5.0,"I have a Xbox 360 elite and a PSP 2000. I recently bought the PS3 160Gb about a month ago. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a great game, I beat it on normal it two days, the only problem I have with the PS3 is that while playing the game, the PS3 froze. Uncharted, has auto save which saves every few minutes, so when I restarted my PS3 I did not have to do a whole lot to get to the point were I was. I have had all three of my systems freeze a least once.

People have said that Xbox live is better than PS online. I only have one game were I can play online, and that's Socom: Confrontation. Online Play seem to be the same, the only con is that you have to push a bottom talk and you can only talk to long, were on Live, you can just talk all you want. I have a sister and when she get on the Vista computer, and when I play on Live, I lag and can't play. But if I'm on my PS3 we both can online, with almost no lag.

Overall the PS3 is better than the Xbox 360, even tho Sony took out the backwards compatibly with PS2 games, 2 USB ports and the memory stick ports. People also say that the PS3 weights a lot, not really, unlike the Xbox 360 that has the power brick, the PS3 has that built in. It also have built in wireless, which was really nice because I did not have to run any wires. The nicest thing about any PS3 is that you can take out the hard drive and put a bigger one on, like 750GB. The Xbox can only have 120GB max.

Just for fun I had to try this, I put a Xbox and Xbox 360 game in my PS3 and it show a little video and then it said to put it in a Xbox/Xbox 360. Now when I put a PS3 game in my Xbox 360, the 360 could not even read the disc.","Great system, and game"

It's seriouly like a classic arcade, rooled into a updated game system. Before I go on with the posative, I have one just one, the entire reveiw, I promis this is the only negative...

In some of the pac-man games, if you play on a small TV (like me) then it's hard to see everything in general.

*gasping for air* I'm so glad that negative part is over! Back to the posative!

With three totally new games: Pac-man Arrangement, Galaga Arrangement, and Dig-Dug arrangement. These are all great games, that are so much fun!

I've had the game for a few days now and I can only see one thing that bugs me about it: there's so much to do that I have a hard time deciding where to go next! Do I check the Moga forecast and take down a few giant Jaggis for resource points and drops? Go mining and bug catching to gather materials for my next armor set?

I quickly filled the first 20 GBs with demos, Live Arcade games and other things, so if I had bought, the premium, I would already filled it up. Also, the Xbox 360 has been out a year longer than the PS3 and Wii, which means the  game library is much larger, having games for any type of gamer, no matter what their age.

B00064MUIA,5.0,"Okay, after reading nearly every review on amazon, here's my opinon about why it's better than the PSP:

Aformentioned pros:

 Two screens, one's a touch screen, microphone, wi-fi, new games, GBA games, backlighted screen (I didn't bother buying the GBASP), etc. Great battery life, built in charger. extremely creative and original, practically replaces your PDA (or WILL soon), tons of room for change and improvment.

Aformentioned cons:

bottom screen scratches easily for **some**, but I haven't got that problem yet (probably because I wash the screen after each play). It just depends on how hard you press your thumb into it. Not connected to the internet (yet)

Unmentioned pros:

holy monkeys, just lookit this thing. SSSSEEEEXXXXXYYYYY! Also, the MPH:FH demo that comes with it is quite nice. I like going to the title screen and poking the wrong places so I get a nice ping of light blue where I poked. Also, in the game if you select control type TR in options, you poke the enemies to kill them (with your finger or the stylus). It also has way more expansion opportunities than the PSP, which is basically a gameboy color/psx combonation... and we all know that the PSX died. ;) Two screens is very nice, when you want to have a map, but don't want it too small. I know that I often need to go game-map-game-map over and over when I'm  confused, but this potentially kills that. So I'm happy, if not ecstatic.

Unmentioned cons:

When you turn it on, if you press the wrong thing you have to restart it. that's about it, and it's not so annoying either.",Unmentioned pros and cons
B005H40K7W,5.0,"I have played many, many video games over the years, but From Dust is one of those unique games that I choose to hold onto and replay periodically.  The cheap price, level of fun, amazing physics, and unique replay ability makes this game definitely worth the money spent.

The Good:
The first thing you will notice in this game is the amazingly fluid physics.  Just like in nature, everything feels connected.  Water erodes land, sand mixes with the sea, lava hardens and builds on itself, sand evens out, etc.  It just feels natural and intuitive.

There is also little micromanagement needed for the people.  Unlike Black and White, your people build their own buildings, get their own resources, and rarely ask for assistance from you.  As long as you can help empower them, they are actively able to defend themselves.

Despite only having a few levels which do not take too long to beat, it feels like each time you play a level it is a unique experience.  In my own experience, I rarely use the same strategy twice.

The Bad:
-Pathfinding is a nightmare.  Your villagers are quite dumb and will get stuck or need your help getting around obstacles.  I feel like the AI needs a huge boost
-Villages/villagers are too limited.  Villages do not seem to grow an flourish, nor do they take on any real personality.  As such, you do not get very attached to your people.
-The game is too short.  The missions are easily beaten.  Once it is done, you seem to ask ""now what?""  I feel like this could be resolved by adding additional requirements before beating levels.  Maybe villagers need to reach a certain population, build a certain structure, etc.  While there are actually many levels, you just do not seem to spend overly long on them.

In the end, I think the game is definitely worth your hard-earned money due to the immense fun you will have playing it and the awesome replay value.",Great Replay Value

B000XGJH1O,5.0,"Last year just before Christmas, my launch day 360 died from the infamous red rings of death. While I did get a replacement unit which worked well, I never forgot how disappointed I was with Microsoft. and I promised myself to buy a PS3 by the end of 2007.

Today is Christmas 2007, and I am a very proud owner of the 40 GB PS3!

The setup process was very easy, I simply plugged in my hdmi cable (I work at Best Buy, so I used my employee discount to get a good Monster cable. I say it was more than worth the money!), ethernet and ac power cord. What shocks me still is just how much more quieter the PS3 is compared to the 360's jet engine noise. I can barely pick up the hard drive spinning, and the blu-ray disc drive is almost sleath silent. Setting up my PSN account was super easy, and I was online in no time at all.

My main use for the PS3 will be for watching blu-ray and standard dvds. Whoa!!! I had only planned on watching Spiderman 3 for 10 mins, only to be enjoying the super sharp picture and sound at 1080i. My next tv will support 1080p, so my viewing experience will only improve.

B00004SVYQ,5.0,"You call yourself a gamer? But you don't own a NES? Sure you may have an EMU but those suck compared to the real thing. To me if you want to be a true gamer, you need a real NES (or a NES-101 those are cool to and don't fail as often but they are expansive). Here are three reasons why.

1. Almost all of the classic Nintendo characters started here! Think about it. Mario, Link, Samaus, Megaman, and Kirby started here. With this system you can pick up a real copy of Super Mario Bros. or Gradius and go nuts and play them the way they were meant to be played.

2. Will work on a modern HDTV. While this baby won't have HDMI cables you can hook it up with AV cables or an RF cable. It is very easy to set up and unlike a Atari 2600 it won't require fiddling with to make it work.

3. This is just a myriad of reasons... Easy to use controller. Don't have room? This system is flat so you can stack another system or cable box on top of it. Have a buddy/sibling that you actually enjoy playing video games with? There are many great two player video games. Love RPG's? This system is the granddaddy of em all. This system is the best system for platformers. Like to crack open and repair video game systems? This one is for you while there are many functional NES's there are many broken ones out there.

Technical specs via Wikipedia
For its central processing unit (CPU), the NES uses an 8-bit microprocessor produced by Ricoh based on a MOS Technology 6502 core. It incorporates custom sound hardware and a restricted DMA controller on-die.[jargon] To avoid patent payments, the Ricoh CPU disabled the 6502's BCD (binary coded decimal) mode by removing several of the transistors necessary for enabling it. NTSC (North America, Japan, and Korea) versions of the console use the Ricoh 2A03 (or RP2A03), which runs at 1.79 MHz. PAL (Europe, Australasia, and South Asia) versions of the console utilize the Ricoh 2A07 (or RP2A07), which is identical to the 2A03 save for the fact that it runs at a slower 1.66 MHz clock rate and has its sound hardware adjusted accordingly.

The NES contains 2 KiB of onboard work RAM. A game cartridge may contain expanded RAM to increase this amount. It also has 2 KiB of video RAM for the use of the picture processing unit (PPU), 256 bytes of OAM (object attribute memory) to hold a display list of sprites, and 28 bytes of palette RAM. The system supports up to 32 KiB of program ROM at a time, but this can be expanded by orders of magnitude by the process of bank switching. Additionally, cartridges may contain 16,352 bytes (nearly 16 KiB) of address space reserved as ""Expansion Area"", which often contained an 8 KiB SRAM. Expanded Video memory (VROM or VRAM) may also be available on the cartridge (on-cartridge mapping hardware also allowing further video expansion past 12 KiB). The size of NES games varies from 8 KiB (Galaxian) to 1 MiB (Metal Slader Glory), but 128 to 384 KiB was the most common.

The NES uses a custom-made Picture Processing Unit (PPU) developed by Ricoh. The NTSC version (the RP2C02) operates at 5.37 MHz, while the PAL version (the RP2C07) operates at 5.32 MHz.[2] Both versions output composite video and rely on 2KiB of video RAM (VRAM). The PPU also contains 256 bytes of ""object attribute memory""(OAM) on-die, along with 28 bytes to store the color palette, both on separate internal buses.[3]

The image output by the PPU is made up of two layers, the background layer and the sprite layer. These in turn are made up of groups of 8 by 8 pixel ""tiles"". These tiles use two bits per pixel (BPP), allowing them to utilize 3 colors of the main palette, with the fourth color being transparent. The background layer is represented by a table with indices for each tile, along with a palette selection for each 2 by 2 set of tiles (although ""extended attribute mode"" of the cartridge-based MMC5 memory mapper relaxed this limit to one per tile). The sprite layer can hold up to 64 sprites at a time and is made up of entries to the OAM. Each entry to consists of four bytes (y coordinate-1, tile index, vertical flip, horizontal flip, background priority, and color palette selection). The advantage of sprites over the background is that they can be positioned anywhere on the screen, allowing for moving objects, although they take up extra memory. VRAM is used for tile maps and attributes, while 8 KiB of tile patterns are stored on the cartridge (can be increased with bank switching).[4]

The NES color palette is based on NTSC values rather than RGB values. While it has a logical palette of 64 colors(6-bit depth), there are only 54 unique entries due to how it was constructed (12 hues each with 4 intensity levels plus 2 sets of 4 greys, with 2 intensities of each set being identical). Normally, 25 colors may be used simultaneously: one background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. To achieve more colors, programmers could switch the color values mid-frame, as well as manipulate ""color emphasis"" bits to modify individual palette entries at specific screen regions, using carefully timed code.[1]

Up to 64 simultaneous sprites can exist at a time (without reloading sprites mid-frame). Sprites can be either 8 by 8 or 8 by 16 pixels, but this setting affects all sprites, so it must be chosen carefully (Contra and Super Mario Bros. 3 for example use 8x16 mode). There can be up to eight per scan line, with a flag determining when to drop additional sprites, allowing software to rotate sprite priorities. Although this can increase the amount of sprites, doing so almost always causes flicker, as they are simply cycled through.[1]

The background layer can be scrolled both horizontally and vertically. The horizontal scroll can be changed per line for a parallax effect, while the vertical scroll can be changed between scan lines for a split-screen effect.[1] This is often done by trapping Sprite 0 and the non-maskable interrupt (triggered during vertical retrace), but the more advanced memory mappers (see below) generate an interrupt for this purpose.

The standard resolution is 256 by 240 pixels, although it was thought for a time that the NTSC console could only display 256 by 224 pixels, as the top and bottom 8 scan lines are not visible on most television sets. For additional VRAM bandwidth, rendering can be turned off before the raster reaches the bottom of the screen or after it had restarted at the top. The PPU registers and memory can only be accessed by the CPU during the vertical retrace phase, causing NES code to be very sensitive to timing, with the programmer having to alter graphics data between frames.[1]

Arcade versions of the NES's hardware use special variations of the PPU: the PlayChoice-10 uses the RP2C03, while two variants of the Nintendo Vs. Series hardware use the RP2C04 and the RP2C05. All run at 5.37 MHz and output RGB video at NTSC frequencies. The Nintendo Vs. Series versions are modified to prevent easy ROM swapping (the 2C04 came in 4 variations with scrambled palettes, and the 2C05 came in 5 variations with two I/O registers switched and a third register returning a specific value in its normally unused lower bits)

B0007D4MVI,5.0,i already have this game and i got it for free XD i cant believe how expensive it is XD,i already have this game and i got it for ...
B000FQ9QVI,5.0,My son loves this game!,Good!
B000ZJVDA2,5.0,"In Lost Odyssey (LO) you start out as a man named Kaim Argonar, Kaim is very special in that he is an immortal who has lived for 1000 years, unfortunately for Kaim he has amnesia. Through a series of events Kaim meet other immortals who have also lost their memories, it's through the help of these immortals, as well as some mortals that Kaim goes on a quest to regain his memories as well as the memories of the other immortals and ultimately save the world he has come to live in for 1000 years. All throughout your quest the main story of LO is supplemented with 'Dream Sequences' What these are is basically Kaim remembering things that have happened to him over the years. The dreams were very well written and I actually enjoyed reading them, but that's all you did was read, there were no cut scenes depicting these dreams (which would have been awesome) or anything else done with the dreams to make them more interesting. However some dreams were emotionally moving and most of them actually showed you the pain of living for 1000 years....

And herein the problem lies, the dreams are actually better than the main story of the game, now don't get me wrong, the story in LO is good, but that's all it ever is, it never does anything to become great. And the dreams in LO are GREAT, if only they would have done more with them I could quit gaming knowing I had played the perfect JRPG. Anyways moving on, gameplay in LO is old school, its straight from the 90's. That's right I'm talking turn based battles, LO does little to try and change up this 20+ year old formula and for the most part I didn't mind, people who have played any Final Fantasy before 11+ will feel right at home, battles are all random and at first it was refreshing to see this come back in an RPG however by the time I was on the fourth (and final) disc of LO I was so freaking sick of random encounters I stopped fully exploring dungeons, random encounters were fun in the 90's, heck they were still fun in 2001 but fast forward to 2010 and now there just plain boring and completely unnecessary. I will say it again though that the random encounters started grating on my nerves on the 4th disc/ 30 hours into the game, by this time I was antsy to finish the game and that could explain my temporary hatred for random encounters :p.

However after all is said and done LO is easily the best RPG available on the 360, the ending scenes of the game are great, dare I say even better than the dreams? It closes up all the loop holes and even has a very surprising plot twist (not to spoil anything but there is a certain member on your team who becomes the unlikely hero of the game.)

Overall this is a must buy for anyone looking for a good RPG for the 360",WHOA! A Real Blast From The Past

If you like lots of sadistic video game murder and mayhem, then buy this game with no questions asked. As a lifelong gamer, I say that this is the most innovative game ever. It is pretty much like Everquest, except that it is a crime simulation, and it doesn't suck.
You are free to complete missions at your own pace, and there are hundreds of non-mission related goals to do. You can keep track of everything you've done with a stats screen that tracks kill, money made, and other goals completed. The city is absolutely huge, and every little part of it has its own flavor. At night the hookers and thugs come out, while the daytime is more civilized. All cars you steal have unique handling and preformance characteristics.
There are hundreds of little details that I don't have time to mention, but as you play the game, you will notice something different each time. As for replay value, the game won't get old for a long, long time. I've played nonstop for 3 weeks and I'm only about 8% done. It's probably the best game for PS2 yet, and while the graphics and sound aren't the best for PS2, it more than makes up for that in sheer fun.

B000XGJH1O,5.0,"I purchased the 60Gb PS3 this 2007 Christmas. I have never been an Online Gamer, but I am a Movie watcher and Shooter/Racing Game player. Online play became Amazing to me when playing ""Call of Duty 4"".

Multi-Media Features:
- 60 Gb model has all the Camera, Music Player Card Reader plug-in ports for transfering Pictures from Card to USB storage device. Or to just keep Pics and Music on PS3 to save, watch or listen too. Smaller models do not have these ports. 60 Gb has 4 USB ports in front with 2 ports in back& 40Gb has 2 USB on Front with 1 or 2 in Back

Wireless Features:
 - I have been so impressed with the Blue-Tooth Wireless Controllers and Wireless Internet Features and how easy they have been to set up, that I have just purchased a 2nd 40Gb PS3 for my seperate Gaming TV. I just do not see the XBox360 getting any better, but by just extending their Warranty and lowering the System price. The PS3 System is just scratching the Surface in its current & Future abilities.

High Definition:
 - As far as the High Def player war between Blue-ray & HD DVD, it has become overwhelmingly obvious where the future will lie and more PS3's are purchased. Blue-Ray has won. The Blockbuster Store carries Blue-Ray Only & online is selling all HD-DVD's very cheaply. For instance, I already have a DVD Player/Recorder, but the Picture Quality for the Standard DVD Movie is Far better & actually upgraded playing on the PS3 Blue-ray.

Stereo Sound System:
- PS3 supports 7.1 Surround Sound for the ultimate sound for Gaming and Blue-Ray Movies, where the XBox 360 & HD DVD are still at 5.1 Surround Sound.

Movie/Game Disk Insertion, Ejection, & Value:
 - I do not know how the XBox handles disks, but with the PS3, you simply place the Game or Movie in the Slot and it sucks it in and when done & you push eject, it pushes it out to be easily handled by adults and children without ever getting a Scratch on the Disks. I am also finding that my kids put them right into the box when finished. On the other hand, they would leave the disks laying all over the place with the PS2. I have purchased all my PS3 games used, thru Ebay and every game is in as near to New Condition as they can come, while paying 1/2 price for the games. Can't beat that by just waiting 3 months after games release.

On-Line Gaming: Many of the features have been upgraded since the System came out, with PS3 OS updates. It is FREE to Play On-Line. XBox charges $55 a year to play On-Line per XBox console.

Conclusion:
 - I have seen and played both the XBox 360 & PS3 Systems and understand the value of each. However, you can purchase a used/refurbished 40Gb PS3 on ebay with 3 games for about $330 including Free shipping, so I don't see where folks can't afford the High priced PS3, with so many options already included. The issue I have with the new PS3's is that the 80Gb uses emulation to play PS2 games and 20% will not play at all. Thus the reason that I have 1 of the older 60 Gb models with the Hardware necessay to play older games and the newer for my boys who love to play all the new games (Guitar Hero World Tour, Call of Duty 4, Resistance: Fall of man, Resistance 2, etc..). The XBox 360 feels very lightweight and cheap and all friends I know get only 9 month play time each year due to the Red Ring of Death. The PS3 is Heavy and Sturdy, which gives you the feel that it is well made. The XBox 360 now has a 3 year warranty to deal with the constant overheating issues. All my friends who have the Xbox 360 always state that they have the Xbox because there are so many more games to play. Good grief, how many good games can you play in a year and still have a Social Life. Besides XBox just has more Crappy games available. My choice is obviously the PS3. I can't wait for KillZone 2 to come out!","PS3 is Outstanding for Games, Entertainment & Movies for 1 price!!!"
B000GH3PYK,5.0,"The Good: RPG and puzzle elements uniquely combined, charming music, colorful graphics, great story, long campaign

The Bad: Some cheap AI, some gameplay elements are too hard, no infrastructure, no downloadable content

After seeing all the GotY awards for this game I finally picked it up because it was bugging me...and boy am I glad I did. I've never really been the type for puzzle games but this has changed. Mixing RPG elements into a puzzle games is odd and can easily be ruined. It works like this: You have four different colored gems (mana), purple stars (experience), coins, and skulls (to dwindle down your enemies' life). You match three pieces up either horizontally or vertically and you try to get 4 or 5 in a row. Now the RPG element has you wielding spells i.e. Throw Axe will do 4 damage plus 1+ for every skull in play and it requires a certain amount of colored gems. You can buy equipment and armor i.e. a Dwarf Helmet gives you a 50% chance of blocking 1 damage for every 2 or more damage you take.

This is all very simple and easy to understand it's ADDICTIVE! While there is a story it's surprisingly good. You are an Agarian Knight who is trying to stop an evil sorcerer known as Lord Bane from taking your people and turning them into his Undead army. The game sports a 30-40 hour campaign and you won't get bored trust me. While this is great and all there are a few flaws such as the AI being really cheap sometimes and certain gameplay elements are too tough until later on such as capturing cities, enemies, and certain boss fights. The music is very charming and sets the mood just right as well. So, if you want a cool puzzle game that's new, and will keep you busy then pick this up.",My favorite PSP puzzle game
B00MUY0OFU,5.0,Don't bother trying to save money with the generics.  This controller is much more durable and all around a better feel.  I would recomend it for sure.  My children actually prefer these ones over the game pad and Wii remotes.,Buy this not the wanna bes
B000QAVV6G,5.0,"EA does not support the online aspect of this game since pandemic studios has shut down, still this game is the most fun I have had for this price. To make sure the game doesn't freeze at the start screen you have to log out of the psn network. The game will ask you to sign in but just hit the back button and continue offline. By doing so the game will not freeze and you can play the very fun single player game. You will still get your trophies just not the ones that require online play. Its no big deal I bought the game to just to have a good time.

The game itself is your basic sandbox style game with faction missions called contracts that you must complete. You get to play as one of three characters that have a certain perk like carry more ammo, regain health faster or run faster. I am playing as Chris right now but will probably play as all three characters for fun.

The graphics are decent for a 2008 game and the map is of decent size, not super huge but more than enough. The story is a simple ""get revenge"" and sets you up well enough to get going into the game.

The gameplay is where the game shines. Though the game is very unrealistic, that is what makes it fun. You can shoot, blow stuff up, call in air strikes, ride in bikes/cars/choppers, side with a certain faction, bribe factions to get on their good side, mess around just for fun, compete in challenges that are given by your team members like racing, sniping, shooting etc.
The missions are also quite fun, like protecting important people, taking over outposts of other factions, blowing up buildings to rubble and more. The side bounties where my favorites, finding or killing high value targets was my favorite thing to do in this game.

Although every aspect of the game works essentially, they do lack polish. For example, throughout the game you find cash, weapons, and other equipment that requires your chopper guy to come pick up, so you call in the chopper and sometimes it just doesn't pick up the item and then disappears into thin air. You have call him in again and that usually works but is a little annoying. Also misha your jet pilot who you call in for air attacks will sometimes miss the targets and that can cause to die and fail the mission, still these small problems don't take away from the overall experience.

If you just want to have all out fun you can use cheat codes that will give you unlimited health and ammo and go out on a total destruction run. With the cheats the game was ridiculously fun since I was blowing up everyone and thing with C4. It still gives me laughs to plant C4 on a enemy tank and blow it to bits.

Overall, this is not a serious game, the glitches and unrealistic nature of the game is what made it fun for me. The AI can be really dumb at times, and you will hear the same dialogue from npc's and your character over and over again. Still, I would recommend this game just to have a good time blowing up the world in flames.","Super fun game, just play offline!"

B00004U3BX,5.0,"At last!  Like many of you video game frantics out there you have been praying, begging and hoping that someday, out of the blue someone will bring to you a thing that will allow you to make your own games.  Well fellow believers the time has come.  RPG maker is here!  There is much rejoicing and much pain and suffering.
Let me say this right off the bat.  You will need a lot of time to make a game with RPG maker.  That means you will nead about 1-2 months if you hope to create a game.  But that does not involve the time neaded to understand how to use this thing.  From the minute you boot it up.  You will scratch your head raw in a effort to understand how to use RPG Maker.  I spent who knows how many hours trying to figure out how to make levels, make spells,items etc.  At one point I was so deppressed I gave up and did another game.
But wait...
1 month after I got RPG Maker I Botted it up again and gave it another go.  And low and behold, somehow everything fit togeather! At long last I finially understood everything, ""so that s how the event thingy works, so thats how the monster edit goes!"" were thoughts that flashed through my mind.  I set to work making my very first game, Quest for Atlantis.  1 1/2 months later I finially finished it.  It took aproximatly 2 hours per day, for 1 1/2 months to make a 1 hour game.  But it has been worth it.  It is impossible, to say in words, the thrill you get when you finially play your finished game for the first time.  A game that YOU made.  Music, levels, charachters were all made by YOU.  I have also a tidbit of advice for you.  DONT LOSE THE 2 MANUALS!! they will prove invaluble in the future.  But they cant be good all the time.  For instance I was trying to find a ship, one that I had made in the items section and I couldent find it.  The manual only said when the logo for it was displayed.  I finially found it by going to sample dungeon and going under ""Other"" but I am still trying to find the blimp.  Where are you you stupid Blimp?  Also forget about using the animie maker.  Its impossible to use.  RPG Maker is incredibly frustrating at first, But goes above and beyond the call of duty to reward those who stick with it.
The good: you can make your own games! need I say more?  Infinate replay value
the bad: hard to use.  Manuals can be superficial
And the ugly: Incredibly hard to get the hang of.","Incredibly frustrating, but incredibly rewarding"

B00MNPDMEQ,5.0,"There's a lot of ground to cover in this review of Turtle Beach's Ear Force Elite 800 DTS 7.1 headset so bear with this long review.

If you're looking for an ultra-premium gaming headset for the PS4 I think the 800 is really hard to beat by anything else on the market today. I own many different headsets for my various consoles and PC and the 800 is hands down the best headset I've used in terms of audio quality.

--------------------
DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
Firstly, the 800 is a 7.1 surround gaming headset. This is also the first 7.1 headset that I've ever used and I'd describe myself as a skeptic when it comes to surround sound (5.1 and 7.1) headsets. When I think of 7.1 audio I think of legitimate separate speakers plus a sub running from a high-end amp and not headsets. To say that my train of thought going into the 800's was ""how good can it be"" is fair. Well, imagine my surprise that I'm completely floored by the audio from this headset! It's staggeringly good. But more on that in a bit.

The headset itself is pretty darn large; each ear-cup measure approximately 4"" by 2.5"". The headband is a combination of matte-black plastic and rubberized plastic at the crown. Highly polished, glossy plastic covers each of the ear-cups. Padding on the ear cups is more than ample and unlike some of my other Turtle Beach headsets the 800 doesn't start hurting my ears or head during extended play sessions. I'll also mention that my large noggin has no issues comfortably wearing the 800's with room for the headset to keep expanding.

The second major component of the 800 is the base unit. The base unit serves to both charge the headset when not in use and also directly connects to the PS4 via on optical cable (sometimes called TOSLink) and a USB to Mini-USB cable. Both cables are included in the box.

Controls on the 800 are all located on the ear-cups similar to the Sony Gold and Pulse Wireless Headsets. Each ""button"" is placed at the four-axis locations on each ear-cup (N,S,E,W). The buttons aren't buttons in the same sense as they are on the Sony Gold Wireless headset; TB designed sensors under each button icon and you simply press near each sensor (the plastic cover does give a little) to input your commands into the headset. Turtle Beach refers to each of these components as ""rocker plates"". A female voice announces each of your inputs directly through the 800's speakers leaving no doubt about what you just pressed.

--------------------
USE:
--------------------
Getting the 800's configured with the PS4 is very easy though I recommend following the step by step guide in the instruction manual. One of the settings TB requires is counter-intuitive and will leave you with very low audio volume if not set properly in the PS4's settings menu.

I'll say right off the bat that the single biggest annoyance I have with this headset (and the Sony Gold headset) is that you have to memorize where each button is on the headset or take the headset off to make your inputs. I also own a set of Ear Force XO Seven Pro's for my XB1 and it's great having the audio settings (via an adapter) integrate with the controller. I imagine that the annoyance factor will decrease with time as I adjust to the 800's and start to memorize where everything is.

Each earpiece is responsible for different operations on the 800 and I'll cover each in detail.

Left Earpiece:
 Volume +/-: Each function are each controlled via independent buttons on the rocker panel. Top button is volume up and down button reduces volume.
 Bluetooth: BT can be toggled for use with a smartphone or tablet with the standard BT logo'd button on the rocker panel. Note that audio in BT is only stereo.
 Power: Press the button to turn on the headset and hold it down for a few seconds to power off. Note that when the headset is powered on and the button is pressed it toggles the 800's noise cancellation feature.
 3.5mm audio jack: The left earpiece also features a standard audio jack connection for use with compatible devices.
 LED: Each different color indicates a different state the headset is operating in:
1. Red = Charging
2. Blue = Noise cancellation off
3. Pink = Noise cancellation on

Right Earpiece:
 Chat +/-: Independent buttons are again present for chat volume settings. Top button increases volume while the bottom button decreases.
 Mic mute: Pressing this button toggles between active mic and muted mic. Holding this button down cycles through different available mic presets (more on that below).
 Preset: This button cycles through TB Signature Audio presets (again, I'll cover that in detail below) and holding the button cycles between DTS Surround modes (keep reading... I said there was a lot to cover!)
 Charging pads: These little metallic plates are located along the bottom of the right earpice and interface with prongs on the 800's base and are for charging the headset.
 BT LED: Each different color indicates a different state the headset is operating in:
1. Blue = Call mode (HSP) or Headset Profile
2. Pink = Stereo mode (A2DP) or Advanced Audio Distribution Profile; used when listening to music from a compatible device

Base:
I'll mention the base because the LEDs behind the opaque Turtle Beach story each also communicate a state for the headset.

Charging:
1. Red = Headset seated (goes off when fully charged)
2. Blue = No headset in stand or headset is not properly seated

Pairing:
1. Solid light = Headset connected
2. Double blinking light = Headset not connected

Preset information: Again a lot of information. The TL,DR version is that there are many different headset presets for both the mic and surround sound mode. In my experience these do make significant changes to the audio quality coming out of the headset. So play around and find what you like best!

To keep this review from getting out of hand I'll focus on a few key areas of the presets available in this headset. I highly recommend busting out the manual and tinkering around with the sound profiles that suit you best.

Microphone presets: This is a terrific feature for people who game in varying environments. Anyone who's played online knows how annoying it is when someone in your group or lobby has a mic that pics up everything in the room of a particular player. Different mic profiles in the 800 are intended to address those types of issues.

DTS X Surround Presets: There is a lot of different presets depending on the usage including Gaming, Movies, Music and Surround off (stereo audio). Each of these groups has additional presets that dive into specific scenarios. There are presets that focus on enemy footsteps for example or more generically a shooter preset. Under movie mode there are presets for action, horror and so on. Again a lot to cover here. I've quickly found that switching between modes is cool and all but found a few favorites that I like best and tend to leave my headset there.

--------------------
THE HIGHS:
--------------------
(+) Audio quality. The 800 is the best sounding headset I've used period. Even non-surround audio sounds extremely good on this headset.

(+) Audio presets. There's A LOT of sound profiles built into this headset. Take the time to explore and find the ones you like best! I seriously cannot stress enough how much of an impact this makes on audio quality.

(+) Volume. I do tend to read a few other reviews about a product to see how other's impressions stacked up against my own. I noticed that some folks complain about the maximum volume being too low. I didn't find that to be the case at all in my use of the 800 and found the max setting to be uncomfortably loud.

(+) Build quality. This is a seriously nice headset and feels well built and sturdy!

(+) Battery life. Battery life is especially impressive considering the bulk and the amount of speakers this headset is driving. It's hard to estimate exactly how long the charge lasts as my habit is to throw the headset back on the charging stand when not in use. I'd say I'm getting a solid 8 hours of battery life on the occasions that I've purposely let the battery run low.

(+) Lithium. Speaking  of battery I think it's worth mentioning that you're getting a top-notch Lithium-polymer rechargeable battery with the 800.

(+) Weight. Surprisingly for the bulk of this headset it weighs in at only 13oz/370g!

(+) Frequency Response Range. TB advertises a frequency response between 20Hz - 20kHz. Once you try this headset it's a completely believable claim. Low bass sounds rumble satisfyingly while high-end notes and voices are perfectly crisp and clear.

(+) Compatibility. Though not explicitly supported or documented you can definitely use this headset with PC, X360, and Xbox One! I'll mention that on the Xbox consoles the experience isn't technically purely wireless; you'll still need a 3.5mm aux cable to connect to the controller for chat audio. But it's pretty great that you can use this headset across multiple platforms!

--------------------
THE LOWS:
--------------------
(-) Digital audio cable. Turtle Beach cheaped out and threw in a rock-bottom quality digital audio cable. Considering the price this should be a better cable. It gets the job done but extremely cheap and flimsy.

(-) Finger print magnets. The rocker panels on each earpiece are made from highly glossy black plastic (think original PS3) and smudge immediately just by looking at them. No seriously every finger print shows up; doubly if you recently ate Cheetos.

(-) Controls. The inputs are built into the earpieces which is a hassle having to take the headset off or accidentally pressing the wrong button.

(-) Charging. Since the base unit directly interfaces with the PS4 and doesn't have it's own AC adapter you'll have to leave your PS4 in rest mode to continue feeding power to the base unit for charging the headset.

***Special Note on Complaints About Hissing:
Before receiving this headset I read a few reviews that mention this problem. Apparently it's an issue with specific TB headsets. After receiving the headset I was immediately on the ""lookout"" (probably not the best term in this situation) for white noise or background hissing. I have not been able to reproduce that with either my PS4 or Samsung Galaxy S4 while using my 800.

I did, however, have a similar issue on my PC with a non-TB gaming headset that I eventually troubleshot down to my power source. After plugging my PC into a power conditioner I was able to remove that audio hiss. I'll mention that my PS4 (and entire AV stack) is plugged into a power conditioner so that may be why I'm not able to hear a hissing. Certainly this is only my thoughts on why I cannot reproduce this issue and my own experiences with a different headset so not a 100% cause.

--------------------
CLOSING:
--------------------
I know I listed four negatives in ""The Lows"" category but I really feel that each one is relatively minor and not worth dinging the product rating. This is a tremendous headset at a tremendous price (relative to console gaming). But if you're looking for the best out there you'd be hard pressed to find a better sounding headset  for your PS4. Easily recommended!",Incredible Headset Will Leave You With Theater Like Audio

B004BV5O0U,5.0,"Last night I finished this game after many hours of playing.  I'm not going to write a huge review about the game play as many have done so already and an excellent job of it!  This is just an opinion piece...in short, I loved this game!  I am a big fan of JRPGs but I play all types.  I usually have many games going at once, from every type of handheld back to the Gameboy Color.  As a result, it takes me ages to finish any particular game as I get tired of one and play another for a while.  TLoH:TitS kept my interest through some 60 hrs. of playing.  I loved the battle system and never tired of it.  I'm a completest (though I freely admit that I have to use a guide to find absolutely everything - I've never figured out how people know the sequence of events without any clues!)  To get all Braver points and recipes and newspapers and book chapters, well, it took awhile!  I'm actually like to grind though, as I hate to lose the boss battles.  The battles had very entertaining effects and the many side quests seemed useful and not at all pointless as some JRPG side quests are.  I loved the scenery, particularly the sprawling vistas from a high tower or from a cliff side path.  I think the detail was excellent but what I liked the most of all, was the story.  It was realistic (or as realistic as a world like this can be) with really humorous dialogue.  I don't mind reading a lot as long as the story is good, and this one was.  Political intrigue!  Bravery!  Humor!  Romance!  This is a story that any age could play.  I'm 52 and I'd love my 11 yr. old daughter to play it.  There was one part in particular that was very surprising and incredibly emotional - I was devastated to find myself at the end, until I remembered that this was just the first chapter of a trilogy.  Whoo hoo!  I can't wait for the next two chapters!  If you like JRPGs, you can't go wrong with this one.  The better the sales, the better the chances of Chapters 2 and 3.  It's so easy now to just download from the Playstation store.  For some PSP games, I feel that the load time is less from a memory card than from using a UMD.  However, since I don't have the UMD for TLoH, I can't really say that's true for this particular game.  At any rate I highly recommend this game!  (Now on to finishing 999!)",The first game I've finished for ages!
B00BMFIXOW,5.0,love the game play . never liked assassins creed series before. But this one is fun even addictive. find myself playing it way to much. Great moves killing enemies. what an eye candy.,addictive
B000035Y6D,5.0,"Best system for 2D, side-scrolling games, though you can now get a lot of the games through Wii or Wii U, so be sure to look there first, assuming you have a classic controller for one of Nintendo's new consoles.",Best 2D system of all time
B0009PAUJM,5.0,Very good game! Classic,Five Stars
B002AD8Z0W,5.0,"I bought this as a present for my kids who are Scooby Doo fans; and figured it would be a fun game for them to play on their DS.

However, after setting it up for them and trying it out  - it became rather addictive. Its a fun game, with 4 episodes; each of which contain various different levels for extra game play! Each episode has its only story line in which you search for clues to solve the mystery and like the series itself, unmask the crook! The episodes include little cartoons that walk you through the story and take you through the different components to the game.

It has simple controls so kids will have no problem playing and does not require reading - younger kids might need a little help from their parents to figure out what the objective is, or to complete some of the more difficult challenges such as the ""Boss"" where you fight off a larger monster that takes a little more time and effort, but the game is fun and entertaining and will keep kids engaged!

For older family members and parents - it has enough game play to keep you engrossed for sometime and if you enjoy adventure type games, you will like this. I am a Professor Layton fan and though this does not have any taxing mind challenges, the story line was enough to make this my favorite game outside of the Layton series!

This also allows you to play in multiplayer mode with other DS owners which is a nice feature!

All in all this is a great game!!",Fun and entertaining game for whole family!
B001EQPDNS,5.0,"i am still playing this game.  i just play the mini games now.  i went through the whole game in a matter of hours and it was fun.  although it is repetitive, it is fine for those of you (and me) that just want a quick game.  my favorite is the jigsaw puzzles and you can play about 10 games in 5 minutes.  it's hard to keep my attention on something, so i play a few minutes a day and i am satisfied.  if you want a long game, this is not the one for you.  this is very easy and entertaining.",will keep you busy for a while
B00KX766ZS,5.0,"Fantastic game overall; if the ""Sonic Boom"" branding scares you, don't let it. This is one of the best Sonic outings in years.

Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that pulls it's characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a sidescroller like classic games, but with 3D graphics - think something like Donkey Kong Country Returns if you haven't heard of the term ""2.5D"" before. The title incorporates elements from a lot of quality sidescrollers - including world map screens similar to various Mario titles, team based gameplay with unique powers like in The Lost Vikings, expansive maps with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and meshes them all with quality Sonic gameplay.

If you just play through the stages as fast as you can, you'll enjoy a Sonic game with great level designs that's a little less precise than the best games in the series, but has a focus on tricks & special moves to engage instead of asking for precision all the time. With the characters' new ""electro whip"" thingie, they can now swing from grapple points, and with their individual abilities, all the platforming becomes something special. You'll end up pulling off combos like run > jump > swing > air dash > slam down into a zip boost > grind > bounce pad > swing, etc. So the classic-ness of the gameplay, while a little less fast and a little less precise, is actually a lot more engaging and rewarding to play. The game does bring the speed though, it's just metered out a little better than in previous sidescrollers. The camera is also a lot better and more dynamic, with a nice amount of ""lead space"" (the distance between the front of your character and the edge of the screen) so you actually have enough time to see obstacles coming and AVOID them. Crazy!

The game is a bit of an ""adventure"" in that you'll need to return to areas with new characters to gain access to different chunks of the levels and collect different doodads. Collecting doodads is important for a few reasons, namely you need them to access new levels (they're locked and require a certain number of emblems - obtained by finishing the stage, finishing it under a certain amount of time, collecting all the crystal shards in the level, etc. - to unlock), and you need blueprints to get Tails to build you upgrades. These upgrades apply to all characters, and include awesome things like destroying enemies by running through them, revealing item locations on the level map, or adding a ""Ring Vaccuum"" effect to your character so you can grab them by merely getting close to them, instead of having to get through them. A fully powered up character at the end of the game is a big improvement from one at the beginning, so the upgrades are important. Luckily going back into the levels with new characters and using their abilities are really fun. Tails lets you use fans in the level since he can glide, and he also has a toy submarine that lets you access a mini-game to get things too. Knuckles and bust through certain materials and tunnel underground, and Sticks has a boomerang that you can control around in the air - very useful for anything really, but specifically for hitting switches and turning off traps. Our main man Sonic however can air dash, which gives him the ability to reach out of the way areas (""L shaped"" moves; air dashing straight up and right, for instance) and bust through blue blocks. You'll see all these ""hooks"" while making your way through levels, so you're going to WANT to explore further. And with Tails' upgrades, you won't be wandering around aimlessly - you'll see the items on your level map, know where you need to go, and just have to find the way to get there and pick the character who can do it.

The levels are really well designed in general, and - like I said before - gorgeous. This is one game where you'll want to crank the 3D up from time to time, because the depth in the game is really nice. There's a great mix of foreground, mid and background objects and the camera's dynamic; the 3D really makes it look like a diorama with it's mix of depth. All the models & textures look great too - this is one of the nicest looking games on 3DS for sure. It all moves at a smooth clip too. All the worlds are very distinct in aesthetic and feel from one another too. All the levels are built to accommodate both speeding through, with a default ""middle track"" and exploration, with additional ""upper and lower tracks"", to every level. So you'll end up exploring above, below and all over your main track on subsequent playthroughs, but it's always off to the side the speedier stuff - it never gets in the way. They're really good level designs that they function so well just racing through or slowing down and taking your time.

Sonic Shattered Crystal is super enjoyable once you come to terms with it's little oddities. Namely how progression works (gotta get those emblems!) and the less-precise-than-other-Sonic-sidescrollers controls (well, that's not true. It's better than Sonic 4 Part 1 and the Sonic Rivals games). It's gorgeous, the elements it adds to Sonic gameplay are fresh and welcome, the way it handles team based skills works beautifully, there's loads of content here, and it's just a blast to play. Highly recommended - but you don't even need to take my word for it. There's a demo for Sonic Boom on the 3DS eShop - just give it a play. This game is rad and deserves a purchase if you enjoy quality sidescrollers and Sonic games. Also, be on the lookout for it's sequel coming up this year: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice. It's from the same developers and looks to be as good as this one while adding in more to the formula.

Fun fact; the developers of this are Sanzaru Games. They're also the studio that makes Sly Cooper for Sony now (Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for PS3/Vita is freakin' fantastic as well, I should point out). Sony only deals in quality platformers - just look at Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank or Ape Escape - so when Sega gets the makers of Sly Cooper to make a Sonic game, you would figure it would be good, right? Well it is. It's an absolute - baffling - shame that so many outlets refused to cover this and instead focus on the disaster of the console game.","Best Sonic game since Generations; don't let it pass you by! (also, play the eShop demo)"
B00BMFIXOW,5.0,"The last Assassin's Creed game that I played was Assassin's Creed II, and comparing back, this is fantastic. The game sets you as a person helping make a game for a game company that uses a version of the Animus to get game ideas and even full games from a persons memories. It's an interesting delve from the first two games which just had you play as an assassin with not much outside plot development. This sets up much to be excited for.

B000KCX9M4,5.0,"This 3 game collection has 2 of what I consider to be the best games that have ever graced the PS2. These games are Vice City, and San Andreas. Those 2 titles alone make this a must own product, and Grand Theft Auto III is just icing on the cake.

While I don't consider GTA3 to be anywhere near great, it's still a fun installment. The music is subpar, and the controls just feel awkward. The only upside to GTA3 was that it laid the groundwork for all the GTA games that would follow.

Vice City, takes place in a Miami inspired city during the 80's and as such has a fantastic 80's soundtrack. Fun missions, and great stories. Much of the game is inspired by classic 80's movies(Most notably Scarface). The cars and fashion blended with the over the top action that Grand Theft Auto has become known for, will immerse you into the setting and game.

San Andreas, many will say it is the best GTA game produced, and I will quickly correct them, but it is the second best! It takes place in a Los Angeles inspired city during the 90's and while previous titles focused on mafia themes, San Andreas focuses on street gangs.

Over all, it's a great price, and with three amazing titles, you are bound to love at least one, if not all.",2 of the best ps2 games

Why would they package something like Mario 3D Land, which is a slam-dunk hit for the system?  They know you'll buy that eventually, right?

B00000K39I,5.0,"Being few lucky one to play Star Ocean for Super Famicom, I was very excited to play Star Ocean 2 for good reasons.  The original was one of best game for SNES/SFC (as good as FF3/6), and this one is charming as well.  The background is well drawn, and 2D based characters didn't hurt the visual either.
The battle system is revised version of the first one.  For fans of Final Fantasy series may dismiss it as simple button masher, but the beauty of this system appears when you face the boss.  Since there aren't any overpowering summons, tactical thinking is critical.  You can take total control of one character and shift the battle in any way you like (I heavily use Rena for healing and protect Celine).
Translation is not so bad.  It has some mishap which makes some section sound downright silly, but overall translation is well done if not brilliant.  Voice acting is well... I wish there was option to turn it off.  Luckily I got used to it by 15th hour, but Precis' voice is horrible.
The story is compelling.  While this one uses similar ""Advanced civilization (Human) meets undeveloped one"", it is for good.  Storyline is very solid, and characters are very attactive to grab your attention.  This game gives very different feeling than Final Fantasy series and it certainly won't hurt to experience.

B000084318,5.0,"Is this the best Zelda game to date?  Maybe, maybe not.  Does that mean you should avoid picking it up?  Heck no.  This game offers all the questing fun of its genre defining predecessors and is worth playing all the way through *at least* once.
While the look of 'Wind Waker' is new to the Zelda series, it plays just like the Zelda titles on the Nintendo 64.  (Players of those games will find a lot of welcome familiarity with this GameCube title.)  Another new-to-the-Zelda-series feature of this game allows players to take the reigns (er sail) of a boat and use it to explore the game's vast world.  In all, the new additions in this Zelda game suit it nicely and add to its wonderful look and feel.
So, if you're willing to let yourself become glued to your GameCube system and television for a while, then 'Wind Waker' is the game for you.  If you don't have the time to become glued to anything, then pick up this title anyway and play it appreciatively -- you won't be dissapointed!",You won't be dissapointed!
B00001NTSO,5.0,"I really enjoy this game.  There are seven fractions that all broke up when they landed on the planet.  You must choose to represent one.  There are several changes that this game made along with improvement, A.) There  is now a concel that all the countries make up.  When issues arive they all  go to meet on the issue.  You can run for planetary governew where you are  essianly the leader of union.  I really enjoy this and it opens up the  option for a diplomatic victory.  B.) You now have boarders.  This is  simple where your city limits are.  An improvement for a possible AC2 would  be that you can move the boarders by notation and not but building a city.
The one thing I did not like about this game was the tech tree.  I never  felt like I was in charge.  Only having seven diffrent fractions,  (countries) may seem like a down fall but if you stick with one fraction  you will become bitter rivals with other fractions.
I would highly  recommend this game.  There is the enivitable question of wiether it is  better than Civ2.  That of course is tough compition but considering that  Civ2 came out a few years ago AC was able to update some parts.  I think AC  has a slight egde but CIV2 was more impressive for its time.",A great game

B000ZK9QCS,5.0,"Game is graphically outstanding, I can feel the game play as a natural evolution from the original one, which was innovative at its time. Game play improves from their predecessors slightly without Innovative elements, just improvements.

Game is fun to play, it is creative is terms of action-scenes, fighting scenarios, boss-battles, overall design. And once again it is not Innovative but really creative. It can cross at your mind (while playing) WOW !, these guys really put effort and skills to design so good visual effects, game play, bosses battles, cut scenes, weapons-interaction, etc. If one game has this effect in you while playing  ....  Well ... for sure you will enjoy playing it and re-play value will be in place.

Honestly I can not figure out how this game can be rated with one star for some folks out there. I can say for sure that ANY gamer with a taste for hack games will enjoy this game for a long time and for those who do not like hack-games it could be at least worth the try and enjoy it as well.

I feel really satisfied with GOW 3, it is more that I was expecting. I can say no the same for games like Dante's Inferno, Bayoneta, and some other recent games out there (I am not saying they are bad, it's just GOW has set the bar so high).

This game is absolutely recommended, one sure contender for BEST 2010 game.","As usual, GOW is setting the bar highest."

B000QJLQCQ,5.0,"This game is incredibly realistic and lots of fun.  It even uses the Wii's motion sensor to let you nudge and tilt, and the games react the way they do in real life.  I played most of these tables for years and it's great to have the games rendered well.  Black Knight is the original, but I would have liked Black Knight 2000 personally, but it's still a great game.

The camera settings are very natural and make it comfortable to play.
One final note, the way you choose the games is a little awkward in that you move a camera around a virtual arcade.  For a while I didn't realize that you have to go upstairs to see the rest of the games.

I highly recommend this game for fans of video pinball simulations.  We've come a long way from Atari Video Pinball to this excellent instant classic..",Great fun and don't forget to go upstairs!
B00002SVBA,5.0,"A few years ago PCGAMER made a list of the greatest PC games of all time and suprise, suprise guess what game topped the list? X-Com UFO Defense, and it well deserved it.
The game, even when played today still shows it's greatness. I've logged probably more then 1000 hours of gametime playing X-Com and it's many sequels over the years since it first released and the gameplay still amazes me.
If you love strategy games and for some reason haven't tried X-Com  - find a copy of it. (The PC version is WAY easier to get a hold of then the PS1 version and is a better port of the game anyway) If you loved games like Final Fantasy Tactics, C&C, Warcraft or less recognizable classics such as Dune 2 and the more recent Disgaea Hour of Darkness then you owe it to yourself to see what you've been missing.
As with the details the other reviews do a great job so i'll just leave you with this - I've played just nearly every tactical combat/rpg ever made and X-Com is by far the best.","Greatest Game Of All Time, Period."

B001B0BB3S,5.0,"This is going to be sound like a lot of reviews, but here we go; I use to be an dedicated EA sports fan until last year i had some extra cash in the summer, after the basketball season was finish and i bought 2K8 for 20 bucks!! That changed my life with regards to my royalty immediately.  Wow ! What have i been missing all these years i asked myself puzzled beyond belief...

So ofcourse i was desperately waiting the release fo the NBA 2K9 to hit the shelves this year.  This game is awesome, probably the most realistic game you can own!! It looks like a real basketball game, and i am in total control, its amazing!! Players look and move like there real life counterparts which is what every fans craves... to be his/her favorite player.  The controls are numerious but does take some getting used to.  You can control every aspect of your offense and defense with out calling a timeout.

I personally had to take time to get used to the dribbling area of this game.  It is so life like it's scary.  No more EA sports day where you can continue to run around the court until you break into the hole and throw down and unstoppable dunk/layup.  One feature i do not like is that the defense is a bit tricky, i am still getting used to it.  But all and all this game is hands down the best in the business!  I cant imagine how they are going to top this years performence, but be sure i will be at the stores waiting!!!","Great game, no more EA sports, its all about the 2K series..."

The mouse doesn't have a good scroll wheel which is understandable, it randomly activates when playing fps games and is frustrating in csgo, but doesn't happen enough to start a problem.

B000084318,5.0,"I would've given this game 4 stars if I was reviewing it last year when I bought it, but I recently started playing it again and was re-introduced to how fun it can be.  The gameplay is great, very responsive control, it looks good, and the world (water included) seems large.  I agree with others that the islands are a bit small, but it follows the storyline for the islands to be small and far between.  I think the best part of the game is when you actually get the Master Sword.  As a matter of fact, it is one of my favorite moments of all time in a video game.  This game is better than Ocarina of Time in some ways, and in others it is worse, I think the dominant way in which it is better is the amazingly high amount of enemies you have to confront and the incredibly large dungeons, even though there are only 4 true dungeons.  Plus, the story is similar, yet different enough from the other Zeldas that it keeps you interested.  Anyone who would refer to this game as being too childish and or too simple obviously didn't grow up playing any other Zelda games and therefore should be credited for their background of being inexperienced and meritless.  If you want a different but great Zelda, then get this game, if you want Ocarina of Time 2 then.....tough rocks man.  I think anyone that plays long enough to get the master sword will agree with me that this is a genuine Zelda game that provides a genuine Zelda experience.  And for all you naysayers that don't like cartoonish graphics (and I bet half of you watch your share of cartoons) there will be more Zeldas with different scenarios and different themes, so just recognise that Nintendo knows what they are doing...most of the time.",Late Review

B0001X5YN4,5.0,"I read several of the reviews before I baught this game.  And even after that I waited until a friend of mine actually played the game, which I watched for some time.

  Once I installed the game and started playing I had no issues with bugs or lag (frames).  I run this game on a Intel CoreTM 2 Duo T7600 (2.33GHz, 4MB L2 Cache, 667 MHz FSB) with 2GB of RAM, and a GForce 7950 Graphics Card, Windows VISTA OS.

  With that out of the way, as has already been stated befor this game takes place around the city outside of Cherynobyl. The game itself is very challenging and the AI of your opponents can be very clever at times. Its not your average run and gun, with no worry of imminent death. Much like a real fire fight, in this game you can die very quickly if you don't think stratecially and make the most of cover and crossfire (if you have NPC team members with you).  I believe this game was well worth the wait, and while the graphics may be a bit dated... they still look phenomenal with all effects cranked up.

  People tend to give this game a lower rating because they feel its to difficult. In all honesty whats the point of playing a game if you just waltz through it in 4hrs blasting everything in your EXO-suit with your BFG?? Fun, perhaps... but it gets old fast.  I liked this game very much, I found myself dead several times after fighting an opponent head on... Then looking around the same corner to see if my opponent is still there, when in fact he has snuck up behind me and blasted me in the back with a shotgun. Sneaky, I like that.

  This game obviously isn't for everyone... with the majority of people wanting clones of H A L O or similair gameplay its no wonder FPS's are few and far between with truly challenging gameplay.

  I give this game a 5!!!",Fun and Challenging.

B0017QFMJU,5.0,"My Wii AC adapter has broken twice, the first one was the one that came with the Wii itself and the other was a GameStop brand. The official one broke due to a power surge during a storm and the GameStop one broke god knows how, the place where you insert it into the Wii was cheap plastic and all I could see were exposed wires. I then bought this for a very cheap price ($3.50), it arrived fairly quickly and I still have it (I ordered it a year ago). I don't believe it's Nintendo brand, but it looks like it is which is nice. This gets the job done for a great price and is durable enough to survive longer than the other AC cords I've gone through.
I almost forgot to mention, not that it should effect your decision on buying this, but the power brick is very light from what I remember of the real one. This has absolutely no effect on anything, it was just something I noticed, I urge you to buy this if you need a new AC cord. This is perfect in price and quality.

B000P297EI,5.0,"The latest in Capcom's Devil May Cry series, DMC4 introduces some new elements but keeps a lot of the styles and conventions that made Devil May Cry popular in the first place.

The story this time revolves around Nero, a member of The Order of the Sword, a group of holy knights that protects the world against demons. Nero sees Dante, the hero of the previous games, kill the holy leader of their order in the middle of a crowded sermon. After fighting Dante - the story's introductory battle, which ends in Dante leaving with a smart remark - Nero must protect the city from the incursion of demons that have overrun it. The mystery of the occurrences and the truth behind Dante's purpose runs deeper as the story progresses.

As mentioned, the main character is Nero, not Dante. However, for the most part, Nero is similar to Dante and Vergil - a white haired pretty-boy in a long coat with a sword and a gun. Nero has three main weapons - his sword, the Red Queen, his dual-barrel revolver, the Blue Rose, and his glowing demonic arm, the Devil Bringer. Each has its own purposes and abilities. The Red Queen is used for most of the game's combat. Besides combo attacks and the like, it can also be ""revved up"" like an engine (the sword's hilt resembles a motorcycle's handle) to increase its damage. The Blue Rose isn't as damaging as either of the other two weapons, but can be used to wear down enemies - particularly bosses - from a distance. The Devil Bringer is used for throws, but also functions as a grappling hook for use in certain areas and against large enemies. Fans of Dante need not fear, as he is playable as well in parts of the game, using the weapons and styles he possessed in previous games.

DMC4 has a lot of callbacks to old games - moreso than the others do, anyways. The presence of the female leads from DMC 1 and 3 ties connections to those games (the other ones simply acted like they weren't there, similar to Bond Girls) and the introduction of the almost hilariously sexualized Gloria adds a new face to the series. Despite the difference in character styles, Nero and Dante play fairly similar apart from a few differences. This makes Nero familiar to fans of Dante, and Dante familiar to people who have played only this game and played Nero. Finally, the difficulty options are classified as ""Normal"" and ""Devil Hunter"", the latter being for people who have played the previous games and are used to the difficulty level established by it.

The graphics are phenomenal in this game, especially in the cutscenes - this actually leads to some parts where the in-game fighting seems drastically overshadowed by the cutscene fighting. As a whole, the game is very nice to look at, with plenty of cool effects to add to the stylish combat system that DMC loves. The sound is pretty good, with a rock-and-roll soundtrack during fight scenes, but it's nothing particularly exceptional. On another technical note, while the installation on the PS3 version does take 20 minutes at the beginning, I noticed almost no loading time during the rest of the game - the entire thing was smooth and seamless.

The gameplay, style, and graphics in this game are all fantastic. Capcom definitely knows what people want from a DMC game, and 4 delivers. The only mitigating factor is, even with the ""normal"" difficulty level, DMC4 can still get insanely hard at times (outside of combat as well as in it). But, as a whole, DMC4 is a solid package with a lot to love, and if you're willing to invest the time and effort it's worth it.

9/10","Gameplay, Style, and Graphics are all fantastic"

B00YQM1PNY,5.0,"When the Uncharted series first debuted in 2007, it was largely seen as something of a Tomb Raider ripoff (of the original Tomb Raider games, that is).  The series, however, quickly established itself as being something separate from the old Tomb Raider games (with the reboot now strangely being referred to as an Uncharted ripoff which is also... wrong).  They were pulp adventures, largely, filled with action and adventure, peppered by some fantastic set piece moments.  With Uncharted 4 on the horizon, the Uncharted collection is here to remind fans of what it is they loved and to introduce new players to the series.  These remasters are nice, but it also serves as a great way to see how the series evolved.  How it went from the style of the first game to the epicness of the third.

So let's start at the beginning.  The first story centers on Nathan Drake's quest to find Eldorado. As a descendant of Drake he is pretty smart about finding lost treasures and following clues to connect things. Here he wants to search for the Lost City of gold following clues that he has left behind. Along with his partner Sully and love interest, Elena, they travel across the world. Along the way they face pirates looking for the same treasure. What unfolds is a story that is so much bigger. What has often made the Uncharted games fun storytelling is that the games themselves have relatively simple stories... but they have fun, charming characters. The writing is fantastic, the sense of humor impeccable. It goes to show it isn't just the idea the story has going for it, but how that story is presented. Clearly Uncharted has borrowed cues from Romancing the Stone, Jewel of Nile, Tomb Raider and (most obvious of all) Indiana Jones. It's action packed, with spectacles all around.

You needn't play the Uncharted games in order to understand the story at all.  While games might make references to each other they're fairly episodic in nature.  If you're new to the series, however, I'd recommend starting with the first one just to get it out of the way.  Uncharted 2 and 3 are so much better games you'd likely never want to play the first one again afterwards.  The games are fun, but the first is most certainly the weakest in the series.  It's the one which features the most boring gameplay and most tame set piece moments.  The gameplay of Uncharted is very similar to Gears of War.  You play through each game and get into fire fights.  During these fire fights you can always take cover behind whatever structures are in the area.  Nate can carry two weapons at a time.  He can carry one two-handed weapon such as a shotgun or an assault rifle, and he can carry one pistol such as a handgun or desert eagle.  As fire fights commence you'll pop out and shoot and take cover.  Sometimes you might be chased out when enemies throw grenades or when your cover gets destroyed.  Nate can also grab grenades which, thankfully in this collection, don't require the motion controls to use anymore.

This makes up the basic frame work of all three games, but in the first Uncharted it's a somewhat daunted by these mechanics.  Not because they're bad, but because the first Uncharted doesn't fully know a lot of variety.  For the most part, the first Uncharted isn't a properly paced game.  For the most part you're constantly running from one gun fight to the next without a whole lot to break up the monotony of the gun fights themselves.  There are a good variety of weapons, but for the most part it's just mowing down bad guys in tense firefights.  There are a few set piece moments like an exciting jeep chase and a part on a jet ski, but aside from these moments the first Uncharted is definitely the game in this collection that hasn't aged very well at all.  The way melee combat works in the game is also a sign of this.  It feels loose and clumsy and, for the most part, isn't really necessary at all.  The first Uncharted also has a terrible implementation of quick time events.  The kind you're likely to fail because you're surprised the game has them in the first place.  These things don't make the first Uncharted bad.  It's a solid game.  They do, however, help you realize just how poorly the game has aged in comparison to the next two.

Uncharted 2, on the other hand, pretty much went above and beyond the first in almost every way. Where as the first begins with you on a boat digging up a coffin. Uncharted 2 opens literally with a bang. You're in a train teetering off the edge of a cliff and you have to climb out before it goes. But you've also been shot and you're bleeding out. The game then flashes back to the events which lead up to it. Like the first, Drake has found information about a famous explorer. This time Marco Polo. Apparently he found the lost city of Shambala and now Drake must find it. Sully and Elena return but we're also introduced to new characters such as Chloe and Flynn. But more than that, the story really amps up this time around on both an emotional level and on an adventurous one. The villain, for instance, is much more threatening and lethal. You won't find yourself in fear of the first game's Gabriel Roman by any means. But Zoran Lazarevic is so much more intimidating.

There are tons of areas where Uncharted 2 does better than the first. Even in specifics to gameplay. The platforming is more refined. Even more than that the gunplay is the most well tweaked. You now have a reticle for blind fire. You can throw grenades seamlessly and fighting hand to hand is simpler. It's complete with counter attacks. The story also paces so much better. The first Uncharted had a few big adventure moments such as a short jeep chase, but Uncharted 2 had so much more. A daring chase across rooftops as a Helicopter tries to gun you down, a fantastic train sequences, a game of cat and mouse with a tank... and it keeps pace brilliantly. Because of all this refinement with pacing, storytelling and gameplay, Uncharted 2 is pretty much the go to example of how to make a sequel better than the original. It outdoes the original in every way.

The pacing is improved because instead of running from gunfight to gunfight there are things that break up the action.  Uncharted 2 makes good use of downtime. After a tense helicopter chase, for instance, the game dials it back to giving you some simple platforming afterwards, a puzzle before it slowly starts to ramp up the action again.  Uncharted 2 does this again and again.  The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but they make for a nice break between the action.  In comparison to the first Uncharted which kept throwing armies of enemies at you from one room to the next, Uncharted 2 has a lot of variety.  It's a near perfect game.  If there were any problem with Uncharted 2 it would be that the game's final encounter feels pitiful compared to the rest of the experience.  It's simple and repetitive for a game that spent so much time giving us a lot of variety and gameplay improvements.  But after the final encounter we get back to doing what Uncharted 2 does best: set piece moments.  The first Uncharted combined a lot of gameplay mechanics and experiences from other games, but Uncharted 2 masters this combination to make a game that's really fluid.

Uncharted 2 is often cited as one of the greatest games and sequels of all time.  When Uncharted 3 came out, there wasn't really a lot of improvement needed.  Yet, it was also important to make the game feel somewhat different from the second game.  The third game centers more so on Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan's relationship in terms of story.  Not just showing how they came to be allies, but also showing how deep their relationship goes.  Other characters from the series return such as Chloe and Elena, but the game tries to firmly keep to Nate and Sully.  The game is also constantly questioning Nate as it goes on.  What makes someone a madman?  And why does Nate always have to be so obsessed with treasure and danger?  Nathan Drake doesn't fear death... he welcomes it.  The adrenaline he receives from these moments gets him high... but when does the obsession end?  The game is constantly asking this question as it progresses.  It's certainly the best story in the series because of its focus on characters and themes, but it's also likely the best game to play.  It's the Uncharted that even manages to improve on the second one.

Yes, it uses the same basic gameplay.  Taking cover and popping up to fire.  But even Uncharted 3 makes some slight improvements.  For instance, you can now toss grenades back at your enemies.  There are also a larger variety of weapons.  Yet where Uncharted 3 really improves are its set piece moments.  Certainly Uncharted 2's helicopter chase and train sequences were phenomenal, but Uncharted 3 does better.  Some set piece moments include playing as a young Nathan Drake escaping dangerous agents, and Nathan Drake also being on a capsizing cruise liner.  They are intense moments that really show the strength of the Uncharted series.  The melee combat is also better.  This time around it feels more influenced by the Batman Arkham games than anything... but it works and feels fluid.  And unlike the second game, the third game's final encounter is definitely more exciting by giving you the best of Uncharted.  Uncharted 2's final encounter feels out of place... but Uncharted 3's final encounter drops silly gimmicks in favor of simply having you do the things Uncharted is best at: Platforming, melee combat and shooting.

The pacing in Uncharted 3 is also the best.  Uncharted 2 has great pacing, mind you.  It really does.  The third one has more moments of downtime and retrospection for the player.  The Uncharted games (specifically 2 and 3) show how important down time in a game can be.  To take time to breathe in the experience of a game is important.

The Uncharted games are also beautiful.  They have a lot of eye-popping visuals, but the style of the game also works.  Again, the first game was released (as well as the second) where so many developers weren't using a ton of lighthearted aesthetics when they wanted to be serious.  Uncharted opts to be light while peppering moments of seriousness.  The characters are always bantering with each other as you run through areas with them, but they're beautiful areas that are well presented.  The experience is even better on the Playstation 4.  It's in 60 frames per second and looks a lot cleaner and smoother.  This is on par with Naughty Dog's remaster of ""The Last of Us.""  It's not quite as good, though.

One point of contention I have with The Nathan Drake Collection is that the asking price is pretty high.  While the improvements are great, it's a game where you're likely going to play it because you haven't played them before.  In all honesty, it feels like this is the only reason you'd really want The Nathan Drake Collection.  Sixty dollars is a lot to put down on a remastered collection.  Especially when the first three games on the PS3 are exceedingly cheap used.  This isn't like finding a remastered PS2 game where the presentation has been changed to wide screen and the visual improvements are much more noticeable.  For some, the upgrade in visual fidelity is going to be hard to spot with a game remastered for the PS4.

This brings about the question, as always, as to whether or not it's worth buying the Nathan Drake Collection if you still have your trilogy of games on the PS3.  In all honesty, if you own the original three already and you want to experience it on the PS4, it would probably be better to simply wait for a price drop if you HAVE to experience them.  The second and third games have aged relatively well that any improvements to the games don't have an enormous impact on the package itself.  If, on the other hand, you've never played the Uncharted games before and you have a PS4 this is a good time to experience all three games.",Three Treasures Worth Experiencing if You Haven't Before

B00YQ2KCWO,5.0,"Possibly the best game of the last few years.  As epic and well done as GTA V.  This game is an absolute pleasure to play.  I've completed two play throughs and have found new side quests each time.  I became a Fallout fan with Fallout II on the PC.  It was an awesome game.  Fallout 3 a disappointment and New Vegas only an average game.  This one revives the series in a story line more in tune with the original.  Yes, it is a slower type of game play but that is part of its allure.  You can relax and simply enjoy the character story lines and just go exploring if you're tired of the main quest.  Even the side quests will peak your interest to see what will happen.  It has multiple endings and each one different enough from the others to make them worth playing separately.  Even building settlements is fun and can keep you entertained.  An awesome game that is very well thought out and well done.

B0002A6CPA,5.0,"Oh my god.. The minute I pop the disc in my PS2. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I am extremely gald to have purchase Shadow Of Rome now even though it came out about a year ago. I guess I was just kinda slow. Nevertheless this is one incredible game to play. The unbelievable gladitorial fights in the arena is on hell of a hack and slash game. The crowds adores you for killing other gladiators. It is an incredible experience to win them all!!! Bravo!! as the lady crowd cheers and calling your name while you fight in the arena...Here, use this!! Here try this!!! As the crowd occasionally throws food, weapons and items into the arena for you to use.....Very interactive and extremely addictive. I love playing Agrippa the gladiator!!! Cause you have to fight to survive. Big animals like Tigers, Vultures and Yes!! Elephant in the arena!! Getting yourself to the end of the game is one hell of a journey. I can honestly tell you that right at the end of the game, you have to fight at least 5 to 6 bosses b4 it ends. The moment you think it is gonna be over, think again.. Capcom surprises you even more.... Adding more battles at the end putting the player at the edge of their seats. My my!! A BRILLIANT MASTERPIECE. I finished in 30 hours plus. And guess What?? I am gonna play again as there are bonuses for reply value. If you love God Of War, Onimusha, Lord of The Rings genre. This is for YOU!! The sneaking segment of the game gives the player a totally different gameplay and feel to the game. You need to disguise yourself with whatever you can find to seek for the truth of who kill Julius Caesar. Octavianus is the character you play using stealth gathering pertinent informations. You have to be patient though as sneaking missing is not as easy as it looks. But with perseverence and determination, you will get yourself thru and prosecute those who kill Caesar. You constantly switch between 2 characters back and forth as the plot advances... This game has an Epic story line and Hollywood grand scale movie making. When you play the game you will feel as though you are watching a recently release Blockbuster movie. A must buy game for 2005 and the years to come!! I have never played such an incredible hack and slash game in a very long time. Totally worth every penny!!! Hoping for Shadow Of Rome 2 if there's any for PS3.

B0000296O5,5.0,"I am an avid video gamer, I've been playing video games since the early 80's.  My love of RPGs came when the first Final Fantasy was released on the orignal nintendo system.  Since then, I have been hooked to the series, buying consoles for the games (PSone/FF7, PS2/FF10, PS3/FF13), not the other way around. After saying that, my all time favorite would have to be FF8.  The graphics are horrible in comparision to todays games, but the game play makes up for it.  Most RPGs have at least 20-40hrs of playing time, but with the FF series, I'm surprised if I spend less than 200+ hrs.  I have played through the entire game over three times over my lifetime, and for me, the most enjoyable part about this game would have to be the side quests and the addictive card game!  I am the type of person that has to have 100% completion before I move on to the next game, and was devastated when my six year old broke disk 4 of this game, hence the reason why I bought yet another copy.

B00LCHZRIK,5.0,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a wonderful way to end the Wii Us lifecycle. Massive, beautiful, and groundbreaking, BotW is everything a next-gen Zelda game should be.

I know most people got this game for the Switch, but I wanted to get it on the system it was built for. That being said, the game plays really well. From what Ive heard, the Wii U version is almost identical to the Switch version. My only complaint in terms of translation to the Switch is that it removed the second-screen part of the game. Obviously, the Shiekah Slate was meant to represent the game pad. But because of the Switch, this function was removed and replaced with a black screen.

Complaints aside, this game is wonderfully large and deep. Whereas other open-world games tend to be very shallow, there really isn't an empty space in the land of Hyrule. The graphics are great and resemble a sort of mature Wind Waker style. Music is fairly limited, but great in its own way. I absolutely love the amount of customization in the game.

B00000JRSB,5.0,"It's been called everything from the greatest game of all time to the undeniable peak of an already legendary series. It's a big part of the reason Sony overtook Nintendo and ultimately won the 64-bit chapter of the console wars. And, truth be told, it's single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years. So, cutting to the chase, is it worth the hype, does it really measure up to those previously mentioned, simplistic, cherished classics of the 8-bit era, can it really be as good as it's been portrayed? Well, yes and no. Final Fantasy VII is not the best game I've ever played, period. What it is... well, it's easily in the top five.
The story basically throws players into the fast lane right off the bat. The opening video montage leads directly into a late-night raid on the planet's largest governing body, the Shinra, a raid in which the player is actively a part. As events unfold, the point becomes clear; you're a mercenary, aiding a terrorist organization in their efforts to destroy a significant portion of the city to make a point that the Shinra cannot ignore. Five minutes into the game and already it's covered more mature material than the previous six combined. Make no mistake, Final Fantasy VII is not a game you'll want to hand your six year old to help him pass some time in front of the TV. Not only does it cover some rough psychological terrain (mortality, semitism, terrorism and political espionage are discussed, in depth, and confronted... just to name a few) but the characters and dialog themselves aren't nearly as squeaky clean as they were in previous installments.
With that said, the in-game visuals of FF7 are very much lacking, especially in comparison to later titles. This was obviously a very early release for the rugged PSone. Edges were extremely jaggedy, especially so when not in a battle, live renderings of the characters left a lot to be desired and even the cutscenes themselves were compressed poorly, leaving huge artifacts all over the glorious video renderings. In sharp contrast, though, the animation and design of the hundreds of different enemies, players, items and boss characters is amazing, and the variety of static, immovable backgrounds are superbly concepted, executed and presented.
To a much lesser degree than the visuals, the musical score is undermined by the medium in which it's been presented. This is a soundtrack that would have shaken the earth if it were performed by a master orchestra. Unfortunately, the difference between a symphonic performance of these classic songs and the spotty, digitized portrayal that shipped with FF7 is as large as the difference between the sketches of the characters themselves and their eventual presentation on-screen. Sure, you'll recognize them without a second glance... but they've been crammed into a format that really can't do them any justice.
As has been the case with each new chapter in the Final Fantasy legacy, one new tweak has been thrown into the mix, in this case going under the name ""materia."" As the game progresses, you'll find these colorful blocks of concentrated energy (be it on the body of a defeated enemy, alone in a cave somewhere or for sale in a shop) that grant the holder magical abilities. They're the only way to upgrade your characters' abilities, and are completely interchangeable between the members of your party. By equipping a block of materia and then defeating enemies, the magic ""levels up"" and gains new abilities while simultaneously strengthening its previous benefits. Each weapon and bit of armor you find throughout the game has a slot for the employment of materia, which effectively limits the number of them you can use at any one time. You'll eventually need to make some tough choices over which materia to develop and which to ignore.
A lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system, claiming it kills the variety of your characters. The common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character, Square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle. I'd have to disagree. If you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each character's stats like that, you'll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world. Sure, you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast ""fire,"" but it's going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability. Square's kept the variety in this cast, they've simply given you the ability to ignore each character's strengths and sculpt an army on your own accord.
The theory behind Final Fantasy VII is outstanding, yet simple: create a game with an untouchable story, tremendous characters, amazing design, mouth watering special effects and great musical accompaniment. It was the right game with the right pop culture appeal at the right moment. It accomplished every single one of its goals, and it's going to win ""best video game ever"" polls from now until the end of time because of it. What it won't win, though, is a perfect ten from yours truly. While I'd be more than happy to go so far as to say the story contained herein is the best of all the Final Fantasy games, I can't say the same for most of the other aspects of the game. The visuals and audibles are hampered by the PSone's own internal limitations, the characters are topped by those of FF8, and the mini games make me shake my head more than they entertain me. This is very, VERY close to perfection, but I've admittedly played a few titles that are better","Legend, but not Perfection"

B000KCX9M4,5.0,Came all wrapped in original packaging. Great games! 3 years later and I am still happy with my purchase!,Good buy
B00002EPZ2,5.0,"Planescape Torment is a cult classic and is considered by many to have the best story in any video game ever made.  I recently completed it, and I'm here to tell you that the hype is justified--this is an incredible game.  It instantly makes it into my all time top 5.  Planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot I have ever seen in a video game.  It's possible there are some adventure games that can hold a candle to it (I've heard the story in the game The Longest Journey is mind blowing), but I haven't played them.

 In terms of gameplay, this game is similar to the Baldur's Gate series, although it does have a few enhancements to the engine such as the ability to queue up multiple actions.  The combat here is not quite as tight as found in Baldur's Gate, but it gets the job done just fine.  This game is more focused on dialogue than combat, so if you like a very combat heavy game then you might not like it quite as much.  That said, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone who enjoys video games and a good story not enjoying this game.  You should also not get the idea that this is just a point and click adventure game with no real combat.  There is still plenty of combat, and you must do some heavy fighting to get through a number of sequences in the game.

Although there isn't a ton of it, the voice acting is another major strong point in this game that I wanted to mention.  Another thing I like is that you level up A LOT in this game.  You start out as sort of weak, but by the end of the game you are a bad, bad man, and that's something I always like in my RPGs.

 Graphically, this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution, but this doesn't matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen.  Using the mod, it looks fantastic in widescreen.  The artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovely--it made me long for the days of 2d graphics to be honest.  I found full on widescreen at 1280 x 800 to be too zoomed out, so I made a custom resolution for 960 x 600 and found that to be just about right.  In fact, there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google.  Most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new material.

 A gameplay tip I would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements.  I am not sure how much is necessary to get everything, but just thought I'd pass that along.  I created a mage and had them both very, very high.",Amazing Game

B000A2R54M,5.0,"OH MY GOSH, Nintendo really grabs you with this game.  Be warned though, you'll be sucked in, you'll lose sleep playing, you'll giggle with glee finally being able to play MarioKart Online.

Finally, ever since the first MarioKart release back on the SNES we are given online play- and it's about time :)

There's a great mix of tracks to race here- you'll see some new ones, as well as earlier tracks from the N64, SNES and Cube Kart games that were previously released.  There's just so much going on in my mind after playing this title that I don't know where to start.

First off, I have wireless internet & getting MarioKart DS hooked-up took about 1 minute to get it up & running for online play.  Even if you don't have a clue how to get started, Nintendo graciously guides you through the process step-by-step.  It's packaged with two instruction booklets: one for the gameplay & the other for getting set-up online.  Even if you don't plan on playing online (you really should though), the nintendowifi.com website lists all their wi-fi hotspots you can use to play against other human opponents (You'll see that many are located at McDonalds).

The gameplay itself is simple and extremely addictive.  Just like earlier versions of Mario Kart, in the DS version you choose a rider and a car- each character (Mario, Bowser, Princess Peach....etc) has different power-ups, and each car handles differently.  There are also unlockable characters once you progress through the game far enough.

The framerate is fluid, the animations are bright and colorful, and I've found that there is absolutely no slow-down at all.  The music is your typical bouncy/happy marioKart tunes.

You can choose to play online, a VS mode, battlemode, timetrial, circuit trial....there are quite a few modes to play through here so even expert ""power-drifting"" racers will be kept busy for a long time.  Now, with the inclusion of on-line play, this game will never become tired....only your fingers.

I'm just so happy to have this game, I'm almost at the point of tears...tears of joy! WooT!",So much fun You'll Puke

B000XGJH1O,5.0,"The answer is a certified, yes.  i own an x box 360, a nintendo wii, and now i have added the sony ps3 to my arsenal of next gen power houses.  I'll start off by saying this to all the fan boys out there, please do us all a favor and shut the hell up!  You will never prove that one system is better than the others and your pointless belly aching will never stop the production of any one system, they will all be around for ever, the councel war will never cease and that's just the way it is, so stop bi#$#ing!  Well, now that i got that off my chest, i'll start with the review.  The playstation 3 is a visual power house, the amount of things that can be going on at once during a given action is just plain overwhelming, i was playing ratchet and clank and you could swear that your playing a pixar movie, it looks just that good!  I do have to say though, for anyone with an hd tv, make sure you buy the hdmi cable with it, the visual difference is ridiculous.  I just got the ps3 so i haven't had a big chance to test the waters yet, but i do know that there are at least 6 different titles that i can't wait to try out.  Amongst these there are folklore, warhawk, lair, time shift, uncharted and ofcourse grand theft auto IV.  Now the big question, does the ps3 have stronger visuals than the 360, i don't know the specs of either system and i don't care, all i care about is what looks better to my eyes, the answer is simple, neither.  It all depends on the game your playing, each game uses different levels of detail and so it is impossible to compare them, in my opinion, each councel has games that bring new levels of power to the next gen war.  Halo 3 looks absolutely amazing, and oblivion launched the x box with epic environments and stunning effects, and for the ps3 you have heavenly sword which looks absolutely stunning, the way the protagonists hair waves and the epic feel of the wind rustling her clothes with the trees bristling lightly in the distance, or what about about warhawk,  with so many players on at once that it feels as if your in an actual war!
400 bucks!  An increddible system with blue ray capabilities for 400 bucks!?  Pinch me i'm dreaming, the only downside to this system is that it lacks backwords compatability, but i'm keeping my ps2 and if i ever feel like playing a ps2 game on it all i'll have to do is reconnect it to my tv, so who cares!
The games that are out right now aren't the best but there are still some great titles out there and the controls seem as leniar as any other councel,  I don't think there is any system who delivers the fun factor that the wii has to offer but how well will the ps3 make use of its censored controller?  Well that remains to be seen.
There is one thing that kinda bugs me about the ps3 though, and that would be it's online network,  The x box 360 does have the clear edge in terms of online playability, however, the ps3 is still young with its online network, so we will just have to give it time.
Over all the Ps3 delivers the solid package, breath taking visuals, Blue ray and dvd compatability, fun action packed titles, good internet network, and a very competative price tag, it does seem that there's no limit to this councels potential.

fun factor: 4.5/5
Graphics: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Functions: 5/5
Internet: 3.5/5
Overall: 4.8/5

B000CBCVEK,5.0,"I Have to say Mega Man Mverick Hunter X is a very good game, in fact I'm still playin right this minute. If some of u people don't know dis is actually a remake of da original Megaman X fo da SNES. But now dey totally revamped the game in almost every way. 4 one thing the new 3d graphics looks absolutley amzing and fits well even though this game is a side scroller. They have also changed the music but people would barely notice unless they have played the original. Another exclusive is that they have added voice acting in the game, sum of the characters voice actors don't fit very well but otherwise its a nice addition.

 There are also unlockables to obtain like being able to play as Vile (X's arch rival), a 20 sumthin minute anime movie explaining the origins of all the events before X started all his missions, and also they added a funny thing and that is that X can use Ryus (from Street Fighter) special move the Hadoken attack. But everything besides that is still here from the original game. The game still has the same bosses, same special attacks, same annoying hard difficulty and same old Megaman. So do me all a favor and get dis game especially if u have nothing els to play on your PSP......

B0009A4EV2,5.0,"I got this for Christmas from my parents.  Honestly, I thought I would hate it, but since they bought it, I decided to at least try it.  As I played, I found myself saying ""Holy ****, this is ******* awesome.""  IT'S GREAT.  Basically, you are this Knight Guy that worked for a king and his daughter.  Then this total jerk takes this scepter that has forbidden power and curses the king and his daughter.  The Knight guy (you) was not protected, unlike the royals, and yet, he lived without any curse.  There are a total of four playable Characters.  There is Yangus, a former bandit who calls you Guv, a very pretty girl named Jessica, and a castle person named Angelo.  You get to name the Knight (I named him Thor)  The lush music score and the awesome graphics complement the witty humor and the unique monsters.  It is a straight up RPG (role playing game)  where you fight monsters, level up, get items, and all that jazz.

You can make the characters stronger with items, like armor, shields, and things like that.  Each character has three different type of weapons (four if you count fist fighting)  The Hero can get Swords, boomerangs, and Spears.  Yangus can get Clubs/Hammers, Axes, and Scythes.  Jessica can get Whips, Knives, and Staffs.  Angelo gets, Swords, Bows and Arrows, and Staffs.

B000SL4IIG,5.0,"I've seen some unsightly reviews for this 3rd party accessory and they're from people who aren't into it.

I've had the VGA cord and it's fine, but if the game wasn't compatible I had to switch TV's all together, but with this it's as easy as flipping the switch. All the plug ins were fine and sturdy and had great picture coming out. When not using the VGA I used S video and still the image is clean.

The packaging was cheap, but I know the brand and it's to be expected. I suppose it's more for in store retailers to sell and people who just want the cord. I mean, with something like this or similar it's not necessary to hold on to it. It's just gonna be boxed with the console so whatever.

B000056O4Q,5.0,"The original Myst set the standards in puzzle-based graphic adventure, and the standard is maintained with Myst III - Exile.
The game operates from first person perspective.  You move through incredible 360 degree 3D panoramas of various 'ages' - worlds created by Atrus by an ancient writing technique - in an attempt to rescue a book containing another 'age' and prevent its inhabitants from destruction.  There is another character to interact with (though this interaction is mostly by way of recorded messages) whose story you discover as you pursue him through various ages.  The graphics are rich and lush with each 'age' having a clearly defined character linked to its environment.
The plot and puzzles are closely related.  The puzzles are all logical in their operation and require no herculean and improbable leaps to solve, or juggling of inventory items, unlike some adventures.  This is not to say the puzzles are not challenging - although a nice touch is that there are clues to the solutions of many of the puzzles hidden in the first 'age' you visit, which acts as a kind of academy for the adventurer.
Action buffs should stay away.  The pace is languid and you may find yourself stumped for several days by a particular apparatus.  However, an advantage of the game is that a number of puzzles are usually accessible at once and if stuck on one you can always move on to another.  There are no 'timed' puzzles, and until you are almost at the end it is impossible to 'lose' the game or put yourself in a position of no return - it is only your final choices that determine the ending.
One innovation compared to the earlier Myst games is the inclusion of Edanna, a 'nature' age where rather than dealing with clunky machines you manipulate plants and animals.
Some CD swapping is required when moving between ages, but a full install is possible to avoid this inconvenience.",Fantastic puzzle-based graphical adventure

B0000A8VBZ,5.0,"I remember the first time I played this game,I was blown away by the brutal nature of it. I mean,there are other games out there that are just as violent,or maybe even worse than this one,but what makes this game so violent is it could really happen. It's not what I would call ""fantasy violence"" like in MK or Splatterhouse,but it's the killing of human beings in a brutal fashion,in what could be a real kind of setting. This game has you use alot of stealth to sneak up behind gang members to pick them off one by one. There are diffrent ways to kill them. A crowbar,a plastic bag,a glass shard,a sickle and other deadly kinds of weapons. This game is NOT for children. The gameplay is great,and the music is very creepy and it adds such a great feeling to the game. The music fits in perfectly. If you've never played this before,I highly recommend it.

B00004XRBM,5.0,"System Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2013. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several Game of the Year titles, and since then it has appeared on several Greatest Games of All Time lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.

It feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the Shock games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.

System Shock 2 takes place aboard the worlds first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.

Both the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real levels in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access.  You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.

Speaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to Cybernetic Modules that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance,  and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).

The game has more gameplay systems then just the skills. Lets use the weapons as an example.  Each weapon as multiple fire modes that have strengths and weaknesses, such as an overload shot for a laser pistol that does more damage but is energy inefficient. On top of this, each weapon can be modified, provided you have the appropriate skill level. Examples of modification include increasing the clip size, increasing the rate of fire and decreasing kickback. Each time you fire a weapon, its condition starts to degrade, and you must use maintenance tools to keep the weapon in working order. If you neglect a weapon long enough, it can actually break. At that point you need to repair the weapon before you can use it again. On top of this, many of the guns have different types of ammo such as armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds. How does one know what type of ammo to use against each enemy? That is where researching comes in.

When you kill enemies, they often leave behind organs that you can collect from their bodies. If you have a high enough research level, you can research these organs to learn more about the enemies you are facing. It will tell you what types of weapons they have resistances to, which types of weapons they are extra vulnerable  to, and it will also give you a buff to all damage done to them. Researching isn't limited to enemy organs either. You will often find exotic weapons and items that you cannot use until you have researched what they are. Researching items requires different chemicals as well. Which chemicals are required depends on the item. Each deck of the ship has a chemical storeroom that contains a selection of most (but not all) of the chemicals that you need for research. If you are researching an item that requires a chemical that is not in the storeroom on your current deck, you will need to locate the proper chemical somewhere else.

Since System Shock 2 is a survival horror game at its core, you spend a lot of time managing and rationing your supplies. You don't always want to fight every enemy you come across, otherwise you might find yourself out of ammo. Running from or sneaking by enemies are always valid tactics. You can sometimes take more creative approaches as well, such as hacking a turret and baiting enemies into its firing range. There are also vending machines located throughout the ship, which you can spend money (Nanites) that you collect on items such as ammo and health. Not every vending machine sells everything, and you can hack the vending machines to offer you better prices. Nanites are also the currency used to hack, modify, and repair items, so it is up to you to determine the best way to use your supply of them.

All of these layered gameplay systems are what make System Shock 2 stand out as surprisingly modern when compared to current games. Even Bioshock, a critically acclaimed modern game, feels a bit shallow when you compare it to System Shock 2. I would even go as far as to say Bioshock is a watered down version of System Shock 2. This complexity also opens the game up to be played multiple times, and each time you can build your character in drastically different ways. Want to play the game as a stealth character, only killing when absolutely necessary? Thats possible. What to build a melee weapons only character? Thats also possible.

The only thing about System Shock 2 that feels dated are the visuals, and even that can be mitigated to some degree with mods. The story is great, the audio design is both haunting and impactful when it needs to be, and the gameplay was so far ahead of its time that even modern games feel shallow in comparison. If you can get over how the game looks, I would absolutely recommend giving this first person survival horror RPG a try. It might just be your 2013 game of the year from 1999.",System Shock 2 was so far ahead of its time that it still feels surprisingly modern today
B00009WDS8,5.0,"Chrome is not flawless, but it's just plain fun.  There might be some pieces missing, but the most important stuff is done right.
Chrome is a first-person shooter with a couple of important extra features.  These features don't sound like much until you actually get to play through them.  You play as a mercenary/bounty hunter who travels across the galaxy rescuing hostages, recovering stolen equipment, and then getting in the middle of an intergalactic corporate struggle.  The locales that you visit are not only beautiful, but they are huge and wide open.  I can't tell you how much I love those big open areas.  You can easily spend an hour and a half or more on each mission, thanks to all the time that you spend creeping around in the forest, sneaking up on guard patrols or avoiding them altogether.  Sometimes you find a sniper tower that you can use to snipe guys from half a mile away.  The levels are very nonlinear and rarely seem like they are contrived or built just for you.  Instead, it feels like you are actually infiltrating realistic bases and installations.  It's also great being able to play for an hour without seeing a loading screen.  There are a lot of indoor areas too, but they aren't as much fun to play in as the outdoor areas.
Stealth ends up playing a big part in this game, and it ends up being surprisingly good.  Even the pure stealth levels, which I normally hate in a non-stealth action game, are good.  The outdoor areas have lots of trees and rocks to hide behind, and with the use of your binoculars or radar, you can avoid enemy patrols or pop them in the back of the head when you catch them by surprise.  Once again, the big open areas are what allow you to do this.
The weapons have a realistic feel to them.  Automatic weapons can only be fired in bursts, since the kick to them will make them too inaccurate after a few bullets.  Firefights can be pretty tough if you are in the view of more than a couple of enemies.  That's why cleverly taking on one at a time is necessary.  That's also where your cybernetic implants become a crucial part of the game.
Chrome is not the first game to throw in special powers as a twist to the shooter aspect, but it succeeds where many others fail.  They end up working like the force powers in the Jedi Knight games.  All seven of your implants are useful, and they are well-balanced enough so that they don't overpower you and make the game too easy.  This is mostly due to your nervous system getting overloaded if you use them for too long.  If you have three implants turned on, then you can only keep them on for a few seconds at a time.  They all seem well thought out, instead of things that were just thrown in because they sounded kinda neat.
The core gameplay is solid, so a lot of the other things that are good are bonuses.  The most obvious are the game's gorgeous graphics.  Everything looks top-notch.  Another is the storyline, which is a nice surprise (in spite of the bad voice acting).  Another is the successfully implementation of rag-doll physics.  This seems to be hit-and-miss in shooters lately, but here it's great.  Enemies seem to respond realistically, depending upon what weapon you shoot them with.  A shotgun blast to the face produces a much more drastic rag-doll effect than a silenced pistol shot to the head.  Bodies don't dissolve away and disappear like they do in other shooters, and the bullet holes seem to hang around for a while.  One great thing about Chrome is that in an era where action games seem to always end after 8 or 10 hours, it lasts more like 15-20.
As I mentioned before, Chrome certainly has flaws.  One of them is the enemy AI.  It's not bad but it's unsophisticated.  Enemies are too easy to kill with grenades, and they generally won't use any advanced tactics to flush you out of hiding places.  The worst part of the AI is when you throw a grenade and the guy yells ""grenade!"", and then just stands there like an idiot until the grenade blows him across the screen.  This ends up being the biggest problem in the indoor areas, since enemies kind of just stand there and won't help out their comrades when you are killing them in the next room.
Chrome has so many good parts that it's easy to look past its bad parts.  This is a very unique and high-quality shooter in its own right.",Great game that nobody played

B002I0HDLE,5.0,"This is the second Xbox 360 I've purchased this year.  I also own the RE5 Red limited edition that came out in March.  I wish I had waited for this baby.  If you're like me, you like to install your games onto the hard drive to reduce the noise and wear and tear on the DVD drive.  Even with my modest collection of ~10 games, I only had about 25GB of space left on my 120GB drive.  With this version, you get the double the drive space for your games, music, and downloadable content.  You also get the second controller, the CODMW2 game, and a pretty cool looking paint scheme.

So now for the negatives.  This version doesn't come with an HDMI cable or the component HD cables.  You only get the composite set of cables. I actually need the component cables because my receiver only has 3 HDMI input ports (DirecTV, Bluray, and home theater PC take those up) and two component video inputs.  I have a spare set, but if you buy them separately it will cost you an extra $30 or so to get hooked up.  Also, the case for the Modern Warfare 2 game was smashed to pieces.  The game was fine, but I'll need to find a new case for it on the popular auction site.

Finally, a critique on the paint scheme.  The all black w/dark gray markings was a pretty cool idea.  The idea behind the theme was to make it look like a computer that would be used out in the field by the military, sort of like a toughbook or something like that.  I only wished they had put the big ""2"" on the right side of the case (which is the top of the xbox if you use lay it on it's side).  They probably could have been a little more creative with the face plate.  Maybe added a special forces patch or something like that to bottom front (kind of like putting a decal on the lid of your laptop).  Instead, we're all left wondering what ""TF-141"" means and why it doesn't really add much to the whole theme.  I'm nitpicking just because it doesn't seem as well thought out as the HALO 3 limited edition from a few years ago, or the very limited edition Grand Theft Auto IV version from last year.

B00ZQB28XK,5.0,"From an average gamer: I play a variety of different games from Fallout4, Guilty Gear XRD to  Final Fantasy series to name a few.

I haven't been following the ""hype"" like everyone has been. Truthfully, I didn't even know the game's existence till after the game's release and what first caught my eye was posts on reddit of people hating on it and the people defending it (and the bickering back and forth). I did some online searches to find more information about what the game is supposed to be about. An exploration, resource management, survival game with a f' ton of planets. After all the negative/ positive reviews, i figured this is how the game would be:

Expectation:
[I'll be mostly alone. Need to collect resources to survive. Carefully management the things i gather or else i'll die. Get off the planet to find a more stable one. Along the way I'll meet with aliens and such to trade items for better ship upgrades. Find some mysterious stuff while i am exploring to bring more to a story. Make life or death situations]

The mechanics of a lot of resource gathering games similar to  ""Out there"" or ""This war of mine"" on a phone game. By the way If you played any of these games, NMS is for you.

Well anyway enough foreplay - after all the contemplating and researching I decided buy the game to try it out and will be reviewing as I put hours into it because it sounds like everything I'd like.

08/16/16 Day 1 Journal (SOME SPOILERS BUT NOT REALLY, JUST GAME MECHANICS):

Reality:
This game is absolutely beautiful. I am on a planet  I can't pronounce that I just apparently ""discovered""... crashed on is a better word (just like Columbus!) No start screen really, you are just crashed there, you wake up and everything is critical - your ship is wrecked and all you got is your exo suit, propulsion pack and your mining gun thing. I am looking around and i realize my suit is reading the whole planet is radioactive... just my f'in luck.  I am panicking now. My hazmat protection is depleting and and trying to figure out how to recharge the damn thing because I have no instructions. *I AM GOING TO DIE* . Now i am testing buttons on my controller Center (opens inventory) The triggers flips between the 3 inventories you have [EXO SUIT] [SHIP] & [MINING THING... later to find out is called multitool] each with limited amount of space for items. Boom, right trigger mining thing now I am blasting everything - collecting resources - SHI* my mining thing is running out of whatever it needs to function.

Anyway, i am in my inventory now looking at everything - it shows the parts of the ship that needs to be repaired and whatever resources needed, what resources needed to recharge your suit/s hazmat and life support systems. Which are the main mechanics of our main survival portion of our game- which is pretty much what i was expecting. Mine for the resource - apply it to whatever you need it to (recharging your suit, upgrading your suit, fixing parts of a ship, upgrading parts of your ship, recharging your gun, upgrading your gun). Got it. Luckily when i was trigger happy earlier i got a few things i need to bring up my hazmat and gun  recharged over 50%. Now understand what specific resources to 100% recharge/repair and max out resources block slots for exploration.

I repaired my scanner and whatever i could repair with the resources in my current area. Then ventured off to find materials for my ship. Walk walk walk - nothing yet.. ON WARD! I take in the scenery - its wonderful - except for the radiated air on this planet - but the glowing radiation is eerily beautiful. I see my first signs of local wildlife- please don't be hostile. I scan it and move on.

Now I am just exploring everything, the tops of mountains - the deep caves. Then while randomly walking outside I see something that catches my eye in a distant- a building of a sort. Something out of place from everything else. It's not far but it'll take several minutes to get there. Why the hell not? That was my destination - i get side tracked by a crashed spaceship -  a couple of downed pods- more animal species. I am finding blueprints for my gun and spaceships in these pods. I learned some alien language too along the way. I even found a building that had a upgrade for my suit for an extra slot (hell yes). There are little things you'll find that are ""clues"" to your journey which i find pretty awesome since it's about discovery.  At this point i am several hours into the game and it's getting late so I decided to get back on track and make it to my destination to see a save point (there are a bunch scattered around under a spot light). Propulsion jump jump jump repeat. Yay i made it - a  medium size building with a little one besides it with a save point. The little one had the ""clue"" and some items. But when i walked into the larger building - some alien dude was sitting there. When i interacted with him - he was ANGRY and spitting in my face as he was talking. WTH man i just got here. He speaks to me in a alien language and then 4 choice come up (giving up a tiny amount of resources). Thankfully i picked the right one... i think. I didn't die. Also i learned a new word.  I was actually at a trading post. I saved my progress.

DAY 1 REVIEW [So far it's been quite an experience - visuals, controls, mechanics. It feels like a solid title and I can't wait to go back in to see what else i can discover when i get off this radioactive rock. The game is so laid back in comparison to most recent titles released. I could sit back on my couch and enjoy this - take my own pace. I can see why some people would say it could be repetitive right off the bat from the comments people are writing - but to me it's not. Only because I understand how these types of game are, how they are supposed to make you feel. Never once as i traveled did i feel like it was a mundane task or felt out of the way to MINE for a resource - i just gathered as i walked by. recharged when i needed to, it was a natural thing. Put yourself in place of solitary person on a planet - trying to survive and figure all these things out, it's awesome]

End of day 1.

8/17/16 Day 2 Journal:

I couldn't wait till i was back to exploring. I fired up the ps4 and was immediately back on my planet right at the location where I last. I decided i should make my way back to the ship and analyze the wildlife on the way back. I was in the middle of scanning something when i realize i was scanning a plant, HOLY CRAP i can analyze these too? I started to scan everything! I check it out in my start menu to check out the stuff i analyzed. I CAN UPLOAD THE INFORMATION TO GET $$!!!  also known as UNITs in the game. I renamed my planet - my system - a few creatures and made a quick buck. I am only at 88% completion on this planet? I must get to 100%. The reward is 225k, oh hell yes. New mission: Get to 100% completion of my radiated planet.

But first - lets repair my ship so i can get to further areas on my planet. I make the journey back to my ship, patch that baby up  - recharge my thrusters. WE HAVE LIFT OFF. I am off the ground floating and i can see the landscape and all the way-points I've discovered earlier on foot. I scan the area with L3 and a green question mark shows up on my radar showing my next undiscovered location. I guide my ship over and land at a the site and there was a exo suit upgrade for me waiting in a pod.. F' yes.. another slot opened. 10k to upgrade? No problem. After the uploads i did earlier i got the monies. I take some time to search the area for my missing wildlife to complete my 100%. But here are only ones i've already discovered so I grab the necessary fuel and take off exploring. My ship is just cruising now - slow speed as I look down to the ground for something different. There it was- a huge landing pad that could fit 10 ships. But there was only 1 other one there. A alien wanted to trade ships for 700k... no thanks man.  I check out the building but it was just a trading post. Got back on my ship went on my way again. After finding several more areas to explore with different types of upgrades - i got to a more hostile terrain, the plants literally were attacking me. Which took me by surprise, so i laser beamed it reduced it to elements and continued exploring. Some of the upgrades i found requires more exotic materials that i don't think exists on this planet so i'll have to wait till get them later.

DAY 2 REVIEW [about 6-7hrs in so far and it's been amazing so far. My view hasn't changed yet, I like it even more and more as the system gets deeper and deeper. I've had a moment where I didn't realize i was low on hazmat suit recharge material and panicked a little. So then i had a few choices; find shelter (go underground, your ship, drop pod, buildings), find materials to recharge. But i digress, simply -we have options. We as players can choose to play the game as you wish. Nothing is stopping us, I could have took off the planet a long time ago once i got my ship fixed, but i didn't. I could try and fight everything i see, but i didn't. Maybe i will later to kill something that's aggressive. But who knows what's in store for me next.]",PLAY JOURNAL & REVIEW

B0053OOEAA,5.0,"I just got my Collectors edition and I must say its better than I expected. You get a nice case that looks like wood and feels pretty durable. Inside on the left is the most awesome steel game case I have ever seen. Inside of the steel case has a beautiful work of art behind the disc and on the outside the big picture of the ring. Talking about the ring is a nice wearable steel ring and also the steel belt buckle. I gotta say the quality is better than I thought. Then finally you have the nice detailed statue that comes with its little stand of the uncharted 3 logo. You can have the Drake statue standing on its own or with the stand.

About the game it comes with a online pass code on the back of the manual and also a voucher for the Starhawk multiplayer beta. The multiplayer of the game is a lot more better than part 2 and more fun. Lots of different maps to play and different choices of kickbacks and custom hero or villain. Co-op is also available but this time with a different kick. Last but not definitely not least is the Amazing Story, I just started but it pulls you in right from the start, definitely game of the year material.

This is a must have for any collector. Its really worth the price. You won't regret it!",Amazing Collectors Edition!

B000FQ9QVI,5.0,"Super Mario Galaxy is an amazing game. I believe that it is one of the best versions of Mario ever made. In it, Mario travels to many unique and fun galaxy to collect power stars in order to save princes Peach. With a great assortment of different galaxies, and special modes like Bee Mario, Spring Mario, and Ice Mario, this game does not get old. There are many chalenging courses to do, all of them very fun and unique.

I only have two minor disappointments with this game. First the final level and fight with Bowser was extremely easy. It took me no time at all to play through it and defeat Bowser. There were many minor stars that were much more difficult than the boss of the game. However, the game continues after you defeat Bowser, and you can keep playing and unlock Luigi. Second, there were very few actual Puzzles. To get to most of the stars, you just have to do some nice stunts, nothing more. I would have liked more puzzling puzzles in this game. However, considering the massive amount of stars available to find, that is not to big of a deal. what little this game lacks in quality, is made up for in quantity.

If you own a Wii, this should be the first game you get. If you don't own a Wii, buy this Mario Galaxy at the same time you buy your Wii. Super Mario Galaxy will not disapoint  even the most skeptical gamer.",Fun For Everyone

The game offers 2 Sonics, and 2 ways to play. This is indeed an epic game, loaded with mysterious power. They must embark on an adventure to defeat their enemies. This game is so much more exciting than the original. There are several colorful characters, you can unlock new challenges, and the music is awesome. In addition, there is a great deal of opportunity for achievements.

There is so much more, including taking on infamous bosses. The super Sonic speed is incredible, and this game provides many fun-filled hours of entertainment.

B00104KJ4W,5.0,"DW6 is unique for many reasons. It's the first really major 3rd party title to hit the PS3, in this reviewers opinion. The DW series has been a huge selling point for Sony for quite some time, and its nice to see its first foray into the ""next generation."" Most of the games for the PS3 are still rather mediocre, so its nice to see one breathe a little life into the system (which I just managed to purchase today as well).

It's also unique due to its revamped and overhauled gameplay. And let's face it - the DW engine, while fun, was incredibly tired, having existed since around 1999, with few to no upgrades. Here, however, we finally see some differing gameplay.

No, it's not completely different, and that's good - DW has been fun. But now, the ability to defend and attack nearly simultaneously has been added to the system. Moreover, the combo meter really racks up - you can pretty much swing your weapon infinitely often, with few to no breaks in attacks. Koei has finally made good on the promise of Siege weapons from DW4, and it is a blast to build rams or destroy ballistae. Also, the character now has the ability to swim in water, or climb castle walls in pursuit of more kills and glory.

Not everything is peachy, however. The graphics are pretty lousy. Yeah, they're an improvement over those found in, say, ""Warriors:Orochi"", but you won't be wowed at all. The sound in the game is fuzzy - you don't hear that satisfying smack when you hammer someone with a sword or spear as in old games. Some of the characters from DW5 have been removed, for no good reason. I have heard that even Jiang Wei fails to make an appearance - an interesting move, since Jiang was essentially the commander-in-chief of the Shu forces in the latter part of RTK. Items have been replaced by a ""skill tree,"" which has good points and bad, but I find it generally weaker than in previous offerings.

But anyway, I've yammered enough, so let me end with this. If you like DW, you're going to love this. It is significantly better and more exciting. If you've never played the games (all eight of you), I would suggest this as a nice starting point.","Solid Title, and it's about time"

B000SQ5LOQ,5.0,"I love ""My Spanish Coach"" and am hoping there'll be a ""Mandarin Coach"" soon. (It can use pinyin rather than characters, if needed).

I don't know how it would be for someone ""learning from scratch"", but if you've ever had any Spanish in the past, this is great for reviewing and adding to whatever you can remember.

The negative reviews seem to be people who didn't use the ""Reference"" section. That's where the phrasebook...dictionary...pronunciation practice are (you hear a native speaker with your phrase of choice, then it records your voice saying the same thing--you can read it on the screen in both English and Spanish--and plays back to show you how close you came. Great feature!).

I'm not sure if this is present from the beginning, or if it unlocks. But you can look back at previous lessons and see grammar lessons on important verbs, grammar rules, etc.  There are also interesting facts about history and geography in various parts of Central and South America.

I just built points with the vocabulary games and kept unlocking then went back and looked at the lessons. I'm sure there are many ways to do it, but this worked well for me. There is A LOT to learn and practice here--all at your own pace--and it blends audio and written practices beautifully.

This is a GREAT product. (Even helped me pass 2 hours productively and pleasantly while waiting at the car dealer!).",Great Way to Improve Your Spanish!

B00002ST7X,5.0,"I have to agree with Blade Reaper on this one. The customers who gave this game positive reviews are absolutely right. Comparing this version to the Sega CD release is like comparing apples to oranges. For a 16 bit cartridge, this game rules. Mortal Combat pales in comparison to Eternal Champions. To get the most out of the game, use the 6 button controller. Learning the special moves will take some time as you need to master nine different fighters. Amazingly, I do a lot better with this game than with Primal Rage for Sega Saturn. The fighters in Eternal Champions are awesome and unique each with their own fighting style and special moves.

B000GHWQUY,5.0,"This system is an absolute no-brainer for those that still absolutely love Genesis and Sega CD games.  It's a small combo system that only uses one AC adapter, which means that it hardly takes up any space at all - A plus for anyone who likes to keep multiple systems hooked up.

However, the catch with this system is that it makes the most sense to be into the Sega CD's paultry library, which isn't particularly small, but isn't drowning in great games either.  The great games that the Sega CD offers are also rather niche, and not for everyone.  I bring this up because it doesnt make much sense to ""overspend"" on the CDX if you hate the Sega CD portion of it - You can just pick up the Genesis at a fraction of the cost and pick amongst the Genesis'robust library.

This really is a wonderful and practical little system that makes the most sense for gamers that really love Genesis and Sega CD games.  Well, I guess this makes sense for collectors too since it isn't the most common old-school machine around.  Just makes sure that you REALLY still love this generation of games, and do a little research into the Sega CD library, before you throw money at it.",Practical System for Genesis and Sega CD lovers

B00EZAWS38,5.0,"This was a great way for me to share my hobby with my children. The content is entirely child-appropriate, but also fun to navigate.

Overall, the graphics are great. Even with my old graphics card (8800GTS), the game ran fluidly and beautifully.

The sound quality was also quite nice. Mickey sounds like Mickey and all of the sound effects were in place.

But the greatest part of the game is the fantastic gameplay. It plays like the old Sega Genesis version, but then introduces all sorts of fun twists. Being chased by a giant apple or timing a jump on a floating marshmallow swimming around a cup of hot chocolate were just simply challenging, rewarding and fun.

The game is not super-easy, but it's not very difficult either. I was able to play through the entire game in three to four hours. I collected only about half of the gems.

Speaking of gems -- the game has some replayability. Gems are hidden through the game. Some are easy to obtain, others take a great deal of thought. So if you're willing to put in the extra time (I'd suspect an additional 6 or 7 hours), you can get all of the gems and other hidden items.

Is this game for you?
If you like side-scrollers like Rayman, played and love the original Sega version or a lover of all things Mickey, then I think you'll have a great time with this hidden gem*.

They may peel a little if you didn't apply it perfectly the first time, but some super glue fixes that right away. I've recommended it to all my gamer friends.",Love It!

B000FQ2D5E,5.0,"MGS4 blew my mind. I am hard to impress but this game has the full package; incredible story, graphics, long game-play time, and more.

You will be blown away by the beauty and detail of the cut scenes, (of which there are multiple hours worth). Surprising mini-games and plenty of humor and cameos for fans of the franchise.",This game makes the PS3 worth the $$$$
B005WYC20K,5.0,"Darklight Crypt, the rarest adventure pack in the skylanders franchise. Ghost Roaster is absolutely perfect with the new voice actor (John Kassir AKA voice of the Crypt Keeper). For those like myself who grew up in the 90's hearing John Kassir voicing Ghost Roaster just sends chills down my spine of sheer joy. The adventure itself is short but very fun. The items are one use per level until you return to the main hub. The best thing is that Ghost Roaster is the only Skylander that can become invulnerable without using an exploit. (At least as far as I know).",Wish more skylanders sets were like this one!

B0001KUE7S,5.0,"This review is both for the X-BOX as well as the PC-version of the game:

You got a weekend coming up? You got some time on your hands? You got a grand supply of Coke and pizza? You got a craving for good horror movies and games? You know how to turn off the lights and turn on your computer/X-BOX? And finally: you got a computer that can actually run this game fast enough (no need to worry here if you have an X-BOX)? Well, then what are you waiting for: get DOOM 3 to have the greatest thrill and chill ride of your life!

Doom 3 is something like TOTAL RECALL (remember Arnold, the Governator, back in his glory days on his mission to Mars?) meets DOOM meets HALF-LIFE meets SYSTEM SHOCK 2.

From the get-go this game simply grips you with its eerie dark atmosphere. And this is the plot: You are a space-marine who just got assigned to a top secret research facility on Mars - very much like an Area 51 in outer space. As soon as you leave the ship and enter the hangar you'll be exploring the base. This part of the game works very much like Half-Life. In a creepy ""calm before the storm""-fashion you get to navigate the dark corridors, offices, underground machinery and even the cantina and restrooms. Even though you can't exactly tell what's wrong -  you get the feeling that something badly out of whack. Some people (you may choose to talk to) seem to be on the edge. A TV blurs about recent happenings. Data-units and screens give you access to information about Mars, the base, the staff etc. You may even listen in to conversations when you're passing by some people. The level of interactivity is amazing and the claustrophobic spooky tone won't let you go until the very end of this game. There's lots of scripted events as well, which are all well done and do not interrupt the flow and overall experience, at all.

Soon you're given a PDA (That's ""Geek"" for: Personal Data Assistant), which allows you to collect access codes for doors depending on you clearance level. Even better: you'll come across data discs other workers, guards, scientists or military personnel have left behind and you may use your PDA to listen in to their recordings. It's just plain spooky walking through almost abandoned underground facilities and finding old recordings, in which workers, who were recently here complain about events they cannot explain.

Finally you will get to share experience. And you'll get more of a fair share of problems! First it's just something small like the lights going out in a gloomy stairwell leaving you in utter darkness. Later on, inexplicable things happen around you and before you know it all hell breaks loose. Soldiers turn to Zombies. Creatures from different dimensions walk the deserted hallways of the base. Out of a sudden the darkness around you is not just oppressive but may hide devilish things around every corner. This is where the true action starts.

This is where the game does turn into Doom. But don't expect hordes of enemies in well- lit surroundings that can easily be defeated! The game remains dark and sinister and it will keep you going just because you'll want to see what creepy areas lie ahead and what nightmarish creatures you'll encounter next. Surprisingly Doom 3 remains tense and suspenseful thanks to a real storyline, which has been implemented quite well through the above mentioned PDA's as well as plenty of information you'll witness on various video-screens inside the bowels of the huge Martian base. In time you'll understand why these inexplicable things are happening and - how to stop them.

The graphics are top notch. IF your PC can deal with them. If you do not have the very latest technology on hand you'll be forced to turn down details - and lose a lot of the best FX that make Doom3 so great. The best thing besides the ultra-realistic object-, character-lighting and bump-mapping is the real-time rendering of shadows. If a light bulb swings around inside an old staircase, you'll see shadows of every railing, grating and other object moving across the floors and walls! Freaky! Fortunately you have a flash-light that will soon become your best friend. Unfortunately you won't be able to use it while you have another weapon equipped, but switching is easy - on the whole it makes the already creepy action even more intense. Fortunately all of these features were carried over to the X-BOX! Even though PC-fans may argue that a TV screen simply cannot deliver the resolution of a monitor, think again once you've seen Doom3 on X-BOX on a state of the art wide-screen and dolby surround system! It rocks! It's amazing that the X-BOX can handle the game so very well. Unless you have a state of the art PC you may even want to consider buying an X-BOX just to run this game - it sure is gonna be cheaper than upgrading your PC with a new graphics card!  :-)

The sounds are very well chosen and placed. From the humming of machines in dark basements to water dripping into deep shafts to the noise of the wind outside the base  and the far-away whistling of ghostly tunes around the starting area of the base - it creates a vision of terrible things around and afoot.

The level design is outstanding! You'll get to appreciate the eerie feeling that something may be lurking around every corner and that whatever is waiting for you there - you can run but you cannot hide in the stuffy claustrophobia-inducing hallways, chambers and ducts. You're gonna explore different parts of the base with plenty of different themes such as: barracks, labs, factory, hangar, reactor etc. but you'll also get to explore the outside of Mars' surface as well as a space station, a hell-like alternate dimension and an underground Martian facility, buried under the surface of the planet for millennia!

The weapons are fairly standard, but they are all a lot of fun to use! From pistols to shotgun, to automatic weapon, plasma gun and rocket-launcher everything is covered. Of course, you'll get a new version of the BFG 1000, too! Last but not least there's a weapon called a soul cube, which is an alien weapon that leeches health from an enemy and uses it to replenish yours. And, boy, does it come in handy later on in the game!

Make sure you PC is up to date - and that your X-BOX power-cord is plugged in  :-)

and have the spookiest 15-20 hours of gaming history.
